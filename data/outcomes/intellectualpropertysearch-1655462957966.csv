The novel dew point cooling technology will bring about enormous economic, environmental and sustainability benefits to the UK, China and worldwide. 
 
Air conditioning is an enormous world-wide business with the global market of around &pound;55 billion per annum. The new type of dew point air conditioner, owing to its significantly higher COP over the traditional ones (10 to 16 times higher), will overcome the difficulties remaining with the existing dew point air conditioners, i.e. larger size, larger flow rate and higher cost, and thus can have its sizes and capital cost reduced to a level comparable to the traditional vapour compression air conditioners. 

Built on the above advantages and the joint venture developed by the UK and China partners, the new air conditioner business is high likely to achieve around &pound;120 million of global annual sales and &pound;24 million of annual interest by 2026. It should be addressed that the joint venture is part of the project targets and the initial plan is to place its head-quarter in the UK and manufacturing base in China, based on the industrial partners (Sinogreen and ebm-papst)' existing facilities and spaces. In the meantime, around &pound;20 million of annual market size will be established on the fan/control-system manufacturing &amp; sale, which are based in an independent UK ebm-papst business and would attract around &pound;4 million of annual interest. 

After 2026, the market sizes of the air conditioner and fan/control system would continue to grow at a rate of 15% to 20% per annum. The project partners, relevant material/components suppliers and unit installers, will directly benefit from the air conditioner and fan/control businesses through product sale/installation, as well as knowledge/technology transfers on the global scale. The UK industry as a whole will benefit by the enhanced competitiveness, increased sale and improved employment opportunities. The end users will benefit by reduced energy costs and improved internal environments. 

This business will also bring about enormous environmental and sustainability benefits that are identified by the reduced CO2 emission and waste dumping, as well as controlled air pollution. Giving an estimated annual installation volume of 0.5 million kW cooling capacity (derived from &pound;120 million of annual sale), the new air conditioners, as replacements to conventional vapour compression air conditioners, would save around 55 million kWh of electricity during a single year operation, thus resulting in reduction in CO2 emission by around 30,000 tonnes. The new air conditioner manufacturing process, owing to around 20% of electrical energy saving potential over the traditional processes, will lead to around 20,000 tonnes of reduced CO2 emission (for 0.5 million kW cooling capacity production).

"EPSRC","EP/J000345/2","Research Grant","Intellectual Property","University of Exeter","Engineering Computer Science and Maths","Mallick","Tapas","","Construction Block with Photovoltaic Device","This invention relates to a construction block for use in a building, the block preferably being of transparent, light transmissive form, and which includes a photovoltaic device to permit the generation of electricity. The use of transparent, typically glass, blocks in buildings to form internal partitions whilst allowing light to pass through the partitions, or in the formation of sections of external walls which allow the transmission of light therethrough is well known. Such blocks are sometimes of solid glass form, but other arrangements in which the blocks are of hollow form are also known, such arrangements being advantageous in that they are of reduced weight and material cost. The incorporation of photovoltaic cells into or onto building structures to allow the generation of electricity is also well known. By way of example, large photovoltaic panels are often located upon or incorporated into the roofs of buildings or are mounted upon the external walls of buildings. Arrangements are known in which photovoltaic panels or cells are incorporated into glass blocks, alongside rechargeable batteries or the like and electrically operable light emitting devices such as light emitting diodes to form a solar powered light which may be incorporated into a structure, for example in the walls or floors thereof. However, in arrangements of this type, the panels or cells and other components substantially prevent the passage or transmission of light completely through the block, and so such devices are unsuitable for use in the formation of light transmitting wall or floor sections. Large solar cells are usually of opaque form and so incorporation of such panels or cells into a transparent block would prevent the block from allowing the transmission of light from one surface thereof to another. Clearly, therefore, the incorporation of large solar cells into transparent blocks intended for use in the construction of a light transmitting region or section of a wall, floor or partition is not appropriate. Arrangements are known in which solar collector devices are used to allow smaller dimension photovoltaic devices to be used and so allowing a quantity of light to pass completely through the block. Such arrangements allow the generation of electricity whilst being suitable for use in the construction of a light transmissive partition. Where used in part of an exterior wall of a building, it is desirable for a transparent block to not only allow the transmission of light between opposing surfaces thereof in order to achieved the desired function of admitting light to the building, but also for the block to be of good thermal insulating properties so as to avoid significantly negatively impacting upon the overall thermal insulating properties of the building in which they are used. Known arrangements are of relatively poor thermal insulating properties and so are unsuitable for use in such applications. It is an object of the invention to provide a block suitable for use in such applications and in which at least some of the disadvantages associated with known blocks are overcome or are of reduced effect. According to the present invention there is provided a block comprising an input wall and an output wall spaced apart from the input wall, a void being formed between the input wall and the output wall, wherein the input wall has a plurality of projections formed integrally therewith, the projections extending toward the output wall and serving to disrupt convection currents forming in the void, at least one of the projections comprising a solar concentrator which has a photovoltaic device mounted thereon. The projections preferably stop short of the output wall, but arrangements are possible in which they extend substantially to the position of the output wall, being spaced therefrom only by a sufficient distance to permit the mounting of the photovoltaic device thereon. It will be appreciated that in such an arrangement, as the photovoltaic device is mounted upon a solar concentrator, it need not be of large dimensions. Consequently, a significant quantity of light is able to pass the photovoltaic device, passing from the input wall to the output wall, and so the block is suitable for use in applications in which it is desired to allow light to enter a building, whilst still allowing electrical energy to be generated. By providing projections which disrupt the formation of convection currents in the void, the thermal insulating properties of the block are enhanced. The projections preferably extend to positions spaced from the input wall by at least 25% of the spacing between the input wall and the output wall. Preferably, they extend to positions spaced from the input wall by 30-60% of the said spacing. Such an arrangement is advantageous in that the formation of convection currents is significantly disrupted, in use, by the projections. At least one of the input wall and the output wall preferably has a peripheral wall formed integrally therewith, the peripheral wall extending towards the other of the input wall and the output wall. Preferably, peripheral walls are associated with both the input wall and the output walls, the peripheral walls engaging one another to space the input wall and the output wall apart from one another, the input wall, the output wall and the peripheral walls together defining the void. The peripheral walls may be cold fused to one another. However, if desired, other securing techniques may be used. The projections may be arranged in a regular array. However, other patterns may be used, if desired. When viewed from the input wall, the parts of the block formed with the solar concentrator(s) and photovoltaic device(s) will appear as dark spots or regions. By appropriate positioning of the projections, a desired visual appearance may be achieved. For example, the dark spots may be arranged to give the appearance of dark lines. If desired, certain of the projections may have no photovoltaic device associated therewith. Instead, they may have a coloured element associated therewith, with the result that the block appears to have coloured spots or regions thereon or therein. Again, by appropriate location of the projections, a desired visual appearance may be achieved. The outer face of the input wall may be shaped to include domed regions aligned with the projections. The domed regions may serve to increase the angle of incidence with which light is able to enter the projections. The output wall may be patterned to provide a desired visual effect. By way of example, it may be textured to provide an obscure glazed effect. Alternatively, through the use of coloured elements mounted upon the projections the block may give the effect of a series of coloured spots or pixels. Where a plurality of photovoltaic devices is present, they are conveniently connected together, and output conductors from the devices are preferably arranged to pass from the block, for example through an opening formed in the output wall or between the input and output walls. The projections may take a range of forms. Where serving as solar concentrators, they are preferably shaped in such a manner as to define an input side of, for example, substantially circular or elliptical shape and an output side of, for example, substantially square or rectangular shape. Whilst the aforementioned shapes are convenient, other shapes may be used. By way of example, the input and/or output sides may be of polygonal shape such as being of hexagonal shape, or they may be of non-regular shape. The photovoltaic device is preferably of substantially the same dimensions as the output side. The input sides of adjacent ones of the solar concentrators are preferably spaced apart from one another.","Patent application published","GB1705840.5","2017","No","Our technical impact has been very strong on the glass block industry wherein we have completely transformed a standard construction material into an innovative energy solution.

Through this workshop we have introduced our product to existing BIPV manufacturers and gathered their feedback, understand the wider challenges BIPV industry faces and unlock routes for future developments. 

The Solar Squared unit will improve the performance of a widely used building material (glass block). The function of architectural glass blocks is to allow daylighting, and lower artificial lighting loads. Thus, Build Solar have reduced the active cell area of the PV, while still pulling back efficiency and yield by concentrating incoming light. The power density at standard tests conditions is analogous to approx. 25 Wp/m2. This compares well with amorphous silicon and organic photovoltaics which also have a similar power density. 

With the addition of the concentrators and solar cells in the block, internal convective air currents are reduced which in turn improves the thermal insulation performance of the block versus the standard hollow version. The traditional glass block has a U-Value =2.8 W/m2 K. Solar Squared Glass Block aims to reduce this by up to 50 %. The improvement of U-Value to 1.4 W/m2 K will result in thermal energy savings of 0.51 kWh/annum/block. This equates to Year 1 savings of 69,700 kWh, the equivalent of 6 houses' energy demand. By year 4 this is 4,056,114 kWh or 347 houses (based on U-Value improvement from 2.8 to 1.4 W/m2 K, Year 1-unit sales of 136,400 units, year 5 unit sales of 7,937,600 units and an average UK household energy usage of 11,700 kWH p.a.). The CO2e savings equate to 24t CO2e saved in Year 1 rising to 1,425t CO2e by Year 4 (based on UK grid CO2e grid electricity of 0.35156kg CO2e/kWH, BEIS Carbon Factors 2017). The price per tonne of carbon saved equates to ?73k in Year 1 falling to just ?11k per tonne by Year 4. Assuming full market adoption to 114m glass blocks this results in carbon savings of over 20,000t per annum. The concentration concept is not new and has been proven in other concentrating solar technologies. In the case of Solar Squared, the team at Exeter have chosen a relatively low power concentrator which magnifies by a factor 3 - 6. This allows the concentrating lens to have a wide angle of acceptance (ca. half acceptance angle 35&deg;), meaning that contrary to typical high concentration application which need dual axis tracking, a vertically installed south facing Solar Squared array should be able to receive light for at least 7 hours a day. The Energy Payback Time of the system can be as low as 3yrs which is comparable to current rooftop PV technologies, something that current BIPV struggle to deliver. The Energy Return On Investment of Solar Squared is targeted to be less than 5 years with an estimated equivalent carbon footprint of 20g CO2e/kWh energy generated. Based on the BEIS toolkit for valuation of energy use the Year 4 energy savings have an NPV of?619,280 and an annualized NPV.",,"5aa69766394624.92017657","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=5aa69766394624.92017657&grantRef=EP%2FJ000345%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/J000345/2","3C6FF4CA-77B7-4F80-9CF3-8B452610A353","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","124B11ED-4328-4198-8550-D4D78E05281F"

The use of transparent, typically glass, blocks in buildings to form internal partitions whilst allowing light to pass through the partitions, or in the formation of sections of external walls which allow the transmission of light therethrough is well known. Such blocks are sometimes of solid glass form, but other arrangements in which the blocks are of hollow form are also known, such arrangements being advantageous in that they are of reduced weight and material cost. The incorporation of photovoltaic cells into or onto building structures to allow the generation of electricity is also well known. By way of example, large photovoltaic panels are often located upon or incorporated into the roofs of buildings or are mounted upon the external walls of buildings. Arrangements are known in which photovoltaic panels or cells are incorporated into glass blocks, alongside rechargeable batteries or the like and electrically operable light emitting devices such as light emitting diodes to form a solar powered light which may be incorporated into a structure, for example in the walls or floors thereof. However, in arrangements of this type, the panels or cells and other components substantially prevent the passage or transmission of light completely through the block, and so such devices are unsuitable for use in the formation of light transmitting wall or floor sections. Large solar cells are usually of opaque form and so incorporation of such panels or cells into a transparent block would prevent the block from allowing the transmission of light from one surface thereof to another. Clearly, therefore, the incorporation of large solar cells into transparent blocks intended for use in the construction of a light transmitting region or section of a wall, floor or partition is not appropriate. Arrangements are known in which solar collector devices are used to allow smaller dimension photovoltaic devices to be used and so allowing a quantity of light to pass completely through the block. Such arrangements allow the generation of electricity whilst being suitable for use in the construction of a light transmissive partition. Where used in part of an exterior wall of a building, it is desirable for a transparent block to not only allow the transmission of light between opposing surfaces thereof in order to achieved the desired function of admitting light to the building, but also for the block to be of good thermal insulating properties so as to avoid significantly negatively impacting upon the overall thermal insulating properties of the building in which they are used. Known arrangements are of relatively poor thermal insulating properties and so are unsuitable for use in such applications. It is an object of the invention to provide a block suitable for use in such applications and in which at least some of the disadvantages associated with known blocks are overcome or are of reduced effect. According to the present invention there is provided a block comprising an input wall and an output wall spaced apart from the input wall, a void being formed between the input wall and the output wall, wherein the input wall has a plurality of projections formed integrally therewith, the projections extending toward the output wall and serving to disrupt convection currents forming in the void, at least one of the projections comprising a solar concentrator which has a photovoltaic device mounted thereon. The projections preferably stop short of the output wall, but arrangements are possible in which they extend substantially to the position of the output wall, being spaced therefrom only by a sufficient distance to permit the mounting of the photovoltaic device thereon. It will be appreciated that in such an arrangement, as the photovoltaic device is mounted upon a solar concentrator, it need not be of large dimensions. Consequently, a significant quantity of light is able to pass the photovoltaic device, passing from the input wall to the output wall, and so the block is suitable for use in applications in which it is desired to allow light to enter a building, whilst still allowing electrical energy to be generated. By providing projections which disrupt the formation of convection currents in the void, the thermal insulating properties of the block are enhanced. The projections preferably extend to positions spaced from the input wall by at least 25% of the spacing between the input wall and the output wall. Preferably, they extend to positions spaced from the input wall by 30-60% of the said spacing. Such an arrangement is advantageous in that the formation of convection currents is significantly disrupted, in use, by the projections. At least one of the input wall and the output wall preferably has a peripheral wall formed integrally therewith, the peripheral wall extending towards the other of the input wall and the output wall. Preferably, peripheral walls are associated with both the input wall and the output walls, the peripheral walls engaging one another to space the input wall and the output wall apart from one another, the input wall, the output wall and the peripheral walls together defining the void. The peripheral walls may be cold fused to one another. However, if desired, other securing techniques may be used. The projections may be arranged in a regular array. However, other patterns may be used, if desired. When viewed from the input wall, the parts of the block formed with the solar concentrator(s) and photovoltaic device(s) will appear as dark spots or regions. By appropriate positioning of the projections, a desired visual appearance may be achieved. For example, the dark spots may be arranged to give the appearance of dark lines. If desired, certain of the projections may have no photovoltaic device associated therewith. Instead, they may have a coloured element associated therewith, with the result that the block appears to have coloured spots or regions thereon or therein. Again, by appropriate location of the projections, a desired visual appearance may be achieved. The outer face of the input wall may be shaped to include domed regions aligned with the projections. The domed regions may serve to increase the angle of incidence with which light is able to enter the projections. The output wall may be patterned to provide a desired visual effect. By way of example, it may be textured to provide an obscure glazed effect. Alternatively, through the use of coloured elements mounted upon the projections the block may give the effect of a series of coloured spots or pixels. Where a plurality of photovoltaic devices is present, they are conveniently connected together, and output conductors from the devices are preferably arranged to pass from the block, for example through an opening formed in the output wall or between the input and output walls. The projections may take a range of forms. Where serving as solar concentrators, they are preferably shaped in such a manner as to define an input side of, for example, substantially circular or elliptical shape and an output side of, for example, substantially square or rectangular shape. Whilst the aforementioned shapes are convenient, other shapes may be used. By way of example, the input and/or output sides may be of polygonal shape such as being of hexagonal shape, or they may be of non-regular shape. The photovoltaic device is preferably of substantially the same dimensions as the output side. The input sides of adjacent ones of the solar concentrators are preferably spaced apart from one another.","Patent application published","GB1705840.5","2017","No","Our technical impact has been very strong on the glass block industry wherein we have completely transformed a standard construction material into an innovative energy solution.

"MRC","1943535","Studentship","Intellectual Property","University of Oxford","Experimental Psychology",,,"","Method for obtaining personalized parameters for transcranial stimulation, transcranial system, method of applying transcranial stimulation","The invention relates to transcranial stimulation. Transcranial stimulation can be used to treat patients or to achieve cognitive enhancement in healthy individuals. Optimal parameters for the stimulation may differ between different individuals but need to be selected from a large range of possible combinations. As a consequence, a practical approach has been to use a one-size-fits-all methodology in which the same set of parameters are used for multiple different subjects. The invention comprises a computer-implemented method for obtaining personalized parameters for transcranial stimulation, comprising: receiving baseline data about a test subject, the baseline data comprising information about the test subject acquired prior to any transcranial stimulation applied to the test subject; and using a Gaussian process model of performance of one or more training subjects to obtain personalized parameters for transcranial stimulation for the test subject based on the received baseline data, wherein: the Gaussian process jointly models subject performance during and/or after transcranial stimulation as a function of both i) parameters defining the transcranial stimulation; and ii) baseline data for the one or more training subjects. Thus, a probabilistic model is provided that intrinsically takes account of variations between different people by means of baseline data. By taking account of the baseline data in this way the inventors have found that the model is better able to predict optimal parameters for the transcranial stimulation even where past data from no or very few subjects with the same or similar baseline data is available. The method is able to provide personalized parameters that vary between different subjects and, on average, perform better than a one-size-fits-all methodology which ignores the fact that people differ from each other, and that the individual brain is plastic and changes over time as well. The present method makes it possible to effectively tailor the stimulation protocol to provide the best outcome. The stimulation may be used for various clinical and non-clinical purposes, including for example improving tremor in Parkinson's, improving people's sustained attention/concentration, memory, mathematical performance, emotions, training capabilities, and learning (e.g., language, maths, IT, factual information).","Patent application published","2000874.4","","No","N/A",,"5e6612a5914fb2.99404625","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=5e6612a5914fb2.99404625&grantRef=1943535","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=1943535","8B266075-1441-4446-AFFF-038DDE47542C","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9",

Extracting value from this data is a key step in areas such as drug targeting and personalized medicine. According to Global Market Insights, the digital genome market is projected to hit $50.4 billion by 2025, and is key for two UK Grand Challenges: AI & data and ageing society. Accordingly, the UK is positioning as a big player through strategic investments to create world leading resources such as UK Biobank and Genomics England. Reaching the full potential of this substantial investment relies on developing associated industries around it to unlock value from the data. However, several barriers still exist: a) Legal, political, or economic restrictions hamper access to multi-institutional and multi-national fragmented data. b) Preparing and analysing the data may require days or even weeks of a highly skilled individual's work performing repetitive low-value tasks. c) Analysing genetic data requires multidisciplinary skills. d) Requirement of large computational resources. Not all organizations perceive these problems the same way. Whilst public organisations and small biotechs struggle to find the adequate skills and allocate the required computational resources, this does not seem to be a major concern for big pharma companies. On the other hand, difficulties accessing multi-organization scattered data affects all organizations. Other problems in the field including scalability, evidence, equity, democratization, information, health, and carbon footprint. Several companies have been created to address these problems, some of whom we have met (LifeBit and DNA Nexus). We do not believe their solutions satisfactorily address the field's major challenges we have identified. In particular, the analyst still needs to see the sensitive data through their platforms and also requires high computational costs and time requirements. The development proposes to overcome these challenges through: 1) An extremely efficient computation engine we developed. Using inexpensive hardware, it reduces large dataset analysis times, from days to seconds. 2) An easy-to-use web system that enables the engine to be interactively queried without requiring direct data access - even by the person analysing it. These technologies together can be disruptive to how data is currently accessed and analysed. Our solution can move the field from the current situation, where an analyst struggles to reach data and then spends weeks in an iterative cycle of data preparation and analysis, to a situation where multi-organization fragmented data is accessed easily, and queried interactively and on-demand.","Trade Mark",,"","Yes","It is used in an early stage spin-out",,"62292d05f25d35.91053044","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=62292d05f25d35.91053044&grantRef=MR%2FR025851%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/R025851/1","77FAFC29-C8BF-401D-9507-4FC816EE6179","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","E33C11BF-D91A-4357-9392-3675549278E2"

Preferably, the livestock is pigs. A ureolytic enzyme, such as urease 12, may be used to convert urea to ammonia. The human sewage and/or food waste can comprise ammonia in the form of ammonium ions in solution. The ammonia may be stripped in step (b) using a desorption process.

The work included both fundamental studies of the synthesis and characterisation of novel polymer-supported Mo(VI) complexes and engineering development of the reactive distillation column (RDC) for olefins epoxidation. A highly active, selective and long-lived heterogeneous polymer-supported alkene epoxidation catalyst has been selected that was initially developed for use in small-scale batch reactions. A continuous alkene epoxidation reactor (Reactive Distillation column - RDC) has been successfully designed, constructed and commissioned in our laboratory. We have developed a new rolled belt shaped catalyst packing material, which is suitable for use in the process of the present invention. The advantages of this packing are very efficient mass transfer between the liquid and vapour phases, low pressure drop, and high hydraulic capacity. We have confirmed the remarkable catalytic performance of this catalyst in continuous epoxidations of cyclohexene, limonene and alpha-pinene employing tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant. Very high conversion of TBHP to cyclohexene oxide (more than 98%) and 100% selectivity towards cyclohexene epoxide was achieved during epoxidation of cyclohexene in the RDC. This study confirmed that this new process is about 50% more energy efficient than the conventional processes.","Patent granted","Chinese Patent Number ZL201080044175.2","2015","No","The smaller integrated plant design leads to lower capital cost of new plant, and very importantly to lower recurrent costs in terms of energy and materials (water, steam, solvent etc.) costs.

In particle separation, a pH-adjusting gas adjusts the pH in the boundary layer surrounding each bubble to inhibit repulsion between bubbles and particles.","Patent application published","WO2014060740","2014","Commercial In Confidence","EU R3Water grant for pilot and industrial scale testing on wastewater sludge digesters",,"545c9bfd05dec5.61099559","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=intellectualproperty&outcomeId=545c9bfd05dec5.61099559&grantRef=EP%2FI019790%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I019790/1","7ABF7B30-71E1-4C4E-BC07-8C45911DBA22","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","722BE89F-BB35-4F17-9BE0-19D10F2BE1E8"
