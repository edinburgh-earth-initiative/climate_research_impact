A UK patent application was filed in July 2021.

Her transformative tech company (Sensory Design &amp; Technology Ltd) - which was funded by a &pound;175,000 Innovate UK Sustainable Innovation Fund Award in 2020 - is leading a new category in the digital olfaction domain: wearable platform technology with the ability to create individual transformative wellbeing experiences through the development of a novel liquid dispense system. This project builds on her KT Fellowship with Philips Research.

According to the mental health charity, MIND, one in four people will experience a mental health problem of some kind each year in England, while one in six will experience a common mental health problem such as anxiety and depression in any given week.

Following the pandemic, rates of addiction and suicide are at an all-time high, and loneliness has reached epidemic proportions. According to the World Health Organisation, an estimated 500 million people globally suffer from anxiety and depression.

The wearing of facemasks certainly hasn't helped the situation. As many of us experienced first-hand during lockdown restrictions, facemasks are uncomfortable to wear. They retain moisture, irritate the skin and create psychological barriers, as well as triggering panic and breathing problems.

As the pandemic progressed, this had a negative psychological impact on NHS workers especially, with many experiencing PTSD, anxiety, depression, and burn-out. According to a BMA Survey of 7000 doctors during the pandemic, 44% of doctors said that they were suffering from depression, anxiety/stress, or other mental health condition made worse by their work.

On top of this, the use of one-time-use PPE is devastating ecosystems and polluting oceans. Approximately 129 billion disposable masks, mostly made from plastic microfibres, and 65 billion disposable gloves have been used every month during the pandemic, according to a study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. 

This collective anxiety, combined with growing environmental emergencies, provides opportunities to build a more nurturing society with global consciousness. To that end, eScent partnered with The Imagination Factory and Anchored-IN to develop a re-usable enhanced FFP3 facemask which offers &quot;personal protective assurance&quot; - that is, a personalized and renewable scent system as a self-delivered biofeedback intervention for mental distress.

Protected by several awarded and pending patents originated from her AHRC funded projects at Central Saint Martins, eScent is a product concept that integrates hardware, software, and a subscription-based fragrance service as a catalyst to improve health, emotional wellbeing, and performance.

Dr Jenny Tillotson is on a mission to help humanity recover from the pandemic and to reconnect with our most primitive of senses - our sense of smell. eScent can be integrated into multiple different form factors, leading to many uses and benefits. This is just the start of what is going to be a very exciting 18 months as we miniaturise the delivery system and look forward to building partnerships in a variety of markets including the wellbeing, fashiontech, protection, entertainment, and psychedelic medicine sectors.

COVID continues to be a problem, despite vaccination. Masks do reduce viral transmission. PPE is more effective than other masks but is still only 98% protective when worn and of course, provides no protection when not worn. FFP3 masks are even more effective than surgical masks.

Outside its host cells, SARS-CoV2 is more vulnerable, even to substances (virus blockers) harmless to man, such as fucoidan (brown seaweed which is &quot;anti-flu&quot; and an anti inflammatory), carrageenan (red seaweed clinically proven to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care personnel treated with an iota-carrageenan nasal spray), liquorice and menthol.

eScent could therefore change the face of FFP3 masks and the utility of natural virus blocking properties in real-life scenarios. eScent is a wearable nebuliser that offers &quot;personal protection assurance&quot; via a patented liquid delivery system to help combat viruses.

Further work is needed to assess the effectiveness or otherwise of viral attachment inhibitors in vitro, then in vivo.","Interest in the eScent from mask manufacturers and the international algae community.
Interest from the NHS (ENT, neuroscience, psychology, oncology, wellbeing, Complementary Health, Digital Health)

Dr Tillotson is working with ENT/Allergy advisors Dr Glenis Scadding (Royal ENT Hospital / UCLH) and Prof Pete Smith (Queensland Allergy Service, Australia) to look at how we can enhance the protection of NHS staff. Dr Tillotson is exploring a combination approach: the use of an FFP3 mask plus automated intermittent use (via eScent) of a nasal virus blocker spray at donning and doffing (for example, algae nasal spray). This would provide continued protection during staff meal breaks, should stop virus colonisation of the nasal passages, and reduce viral transmission to others. In addition, the mask is reusable, reducing the vast amounts of waste currently being generated which is devastating ecosystems and polluting oceans.

eScent could change the face of FFP3 masks and the utility of natural virus blocking properties in real-life scenarios. Protected by six patents and funded by an InnovateUK &quot;Sustainable Innovation Fund&quot; Award, eScent is a wearable nebuliser that offers &quot;personal protection assurance&quot; via a patented liquid delivery system to help combat viruses.

Further work is needed to assess the effectiveness or otherwise of viral attachment inhibitors in vitro, then in vivo.

Environmental timing cues feed into a 'master clock' in the brain, which then synchronizes clocks throughout the body. Light-dark cycles, meal times, and steroid hormones form the strongest cues, tuning our internal clocks to the day-night rhythm. Genetic variation determines how our body clocks align with this rhythm, thus resulting in different 'chronotypes' (i.e. 'morning larks' and 'night owls').

Annually, millions of people stretch the limits of their body clock by rapidly crossing multiple time zones. Temporary misalignment between an individual's body clock and local time in their destination produces 'jet lag', the symptoms of which subside as the body clock adapts to the new time zone. Disruption of our body clocks-as occurs with jet lag and shift work-has far-reaching health effects, playing a role in cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and dementia. If we could rapidly reset the body clock to better accommodate our modern lifestyles, this could have enormous health benefits.

An intense challenge is faced by visitors to high altitude, since exposure to a low-oxygen environment often coincides with jet lag. A prominent feature of both jet lag and ascent to high altitude is sleep disturbance. Most studies of sleep at altitude have failed to control for individual chronotype and body clock function-factors which could substantially modify the body's adaptation to a new time zone. Research on APEX 6 addresses an important knowledge gap; the impact of individual chronotype and jet lag on how the body copes with high altitude. The RESET trial builds on this by testing whether a multi-factorial intervention can accelerate resetting of body clocks and improve sleep function in healthy volunteers exposed to jet lag and high altitude. The trial is due to launch and complete in summer 2022.","Outcome of trial pending. The trial is being conducted by a group of undergraduate medical students during the APEX 6 Expedition to Bolivia. This represents an opportunity for these students to get hands-on clinical research training in the extreme high altitude environment. The research being conducted on the expedition is relevant to those who visit hypoxic environments but also to patients at sea level who are suffering from hypoxia.","https://www.altitude.org/","622ffb831584e3.84197952","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=622ffb831584e3.84197952&grantRef=MC_EX_MR%2FS022023%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MC_EX_MR/S022023/1","900CED36-3DC3-4F1C-B391-51717A06F146","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","AB7C0822-BBCB-4C61-85EC-5D13C7A31759","3F5A301B-D568-459C-9955-04286E602B5D"

This will bring us to the next generation of pharmaceutical dosage form which could solve the difficulty in swallowing among the children and may also be extended to the geriatrics that comitted to long term prescription. In Malaysia, the use of electrospinning in producing pharmaceutical dosage form will enable Malaysia as pioneering in this aspect. The pitch of this idea following the successful production of our pediatric supplement has reached the interest of local pharmaceutical for supporting the expansion of this research as industrial-academia collaboration.

A liquid that restores the naturally occurring gas (Nitric Oxide) to prevent pneumonia in patients on breathing machines: A study to find the best dose'. We have developed a new system that generates and delivers nitric oxide and other oxides of nitrogen (NO/NOx) to the stomach and oral cavity of mechanically ventilated patients. We hypothesise that the use of this solution to decontaminate the mouth, upper throat and stomach will significantly reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in mechanically ventilated patients. During critical illness, production of NO is markedly reduced in the digestive tract. This deficiency predisposes to bacterial overgrowth of the stomach and oral cavity and the subsequent development of VAP following unwanted inhalation of infected secretions. The NO generating solution is designed to restore normal levels of NOx in the oral cavity and stomach. The objective of this therapy is to reduce the incidence of VAP and the associated prolonged length of stay, morbidity, mortality and treatment costs.","Other","http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=15334","56dee238eaa193.55143268","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=56dee238eaa193.55143268&grantRef=MR%2FJ011134%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/J011134/1","1855ECEA-F12D-4F6C-81CC-83BFF1DCA95D","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","88BFEA76-EA0B-4243-BF93-412228049163"

Results of an earlier analysis of a trial of the M72/AS01E candidate vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Van Der Meeren et al. NEJM 2018) showed that in infected adults, the vaccine provided 54.0% protection against active pulmonary tuberculosis disease, without evident safety concerns. We now report the results of the 3-year final analysis of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity.
METHODS
From August 2014 through November 2015, we enrolled adults 18 to 50 years of age with M. tuberculosis infection (defined by positive results on interferon-? release assay) without evidence of active tuberculosis disease at centers in Kenya, South Africa, and
Zambia. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either M72/AS01E or placebo, administered 1 month apart. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of M72/AS01E to prevent active pulmonary tuberculosis disease according to the first case definition (bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis not associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection). Participants were
followed for 3 years after the second dose. Participants with clinical suspicion of tuberculosis provided sputum samples for polymerase-chain-reaction assay, mycobacterial culture, or both. Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were evaluated until month 36 in a subgroup of 300 participants. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of M72/AS01E or placebo.
RESULTS
A total of 3575 participants underwent randomization, of whom 3573 received at least one dose of M72/AS01E or placebo, and 3330 received both planned doses. Among the 3289 participants in the according-to-protocol efficacy cohort, 13 of the 1626 participants in the M72/AS01E group, as compared with 26 of the 1663 participants in the placebo group, had cases of tuberculosis that met the first case definition (incidence, 0.3 vs. 0.6 cases per 100 person-years). The vaccine efficacy at month 36 was 49.7% (90% confidence interval [CI], 12.1 to 71.2; 95% CI, 2.1 to 74.2). Among participants in the M72/AS01E group, the concentrations of M72-specific antibodies and the frequencies of M72-specific CD4+ T cells increased after the first dose and were sustained throughout the follow-up period. Serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases, and deaths occurred with similar frequencies in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among adults infected with M. tuberculosis, vaccination with M72/AS01E elicited an immune response and provided protection against progression to pulmonary tuberculosis disease for at least 3 years.","Van Der Meeren, O., Hatherill, M., Nduba, V., Wilkinson, R.J., Muyoyeta, M., Van Brakel, E., Ayles, H.M., Henostroza, G., Thienemann, F., Scriba, T.J., Diacon, A., Blatner, G.L., Demoiti&eacute;, M-A., Tameris, M., Malahleha, M., Innes, J.C., Hellstrom, E., Martinson, N., Singh, T., Akite, E.J., Azam, A.K., Bollaerts, A., Ginsberg, A.M., Evans, T.G., Gillard, P., Tait, D.R.

Aims
This intervention, designed and developed in partnership with the National Association of Therapeutic Parents, aims to improve the well-being of foster carers through reducing their symptoms of compassion fatigue (CF). Compassion fatigue can be alleviated by reducing levels of burnout and secondary trauma, and by increasing levels of role (or compassion) satisfaction. Reducing levels of compassion fatigue and increasing compassion satisfaction in foster carers is anticipated to improve family stability (including placement stability), increase rates of foster carer retention, and reduce the prevalence of compassion fatigue in the foster carer population.

Background
'Compassion fatigue' is an emotional, physical, and biological response sometimes experienced by people who work in helping professions. Compassion fatigue arises as a result of the emotional toll borne by carers who hear about the trauma suffered by those they support, or who have to watch and manage its consequences (Figley, 2002). There is no agreed definition of compassion fatigue but it is widely understood to be a combination of burnout (feelings of physical and emotional exhaustion, anger, frustration, hopelessness, depression and feeling inefficient in one's job) and secondary traumatic stress (becoming directly affected by the trauma experienced by those for whom one cares). Compassion (or role) satisfaction is defined as the sense of fulfilment or pleasure that people in caring roles derive from doing their work well, and the support they receive in their role. It is thought to mitigate the adverse effects of burnout and secondary traumatic stress (Stamm, 2010). 

Compassion fatigue is characterised by exhaustion, anger and irritability, negative coping behaviours, a reduced ability to empathise, reduced satisfaction with one's work, and impaired decision-making (Cocker and Joss, 2016). Specific symptoms associated with compassion fatigue include low mood, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, intrusive thoughts and nightmares (Cerney, 1995). The longer-term effects of compassion fatigue include poor mental and physical health (Sprang, 2007), a reduction in empathy towards those being supported, and subsequent deterioration in the relationship between the carer and the person they are supporting (Hunkaser, 2015). Compassion fatigue is thought to increase the risk of leaving the professional role (Conrad, 2006).

Compassion fatigue affects the performance of a wide range of professionals, including emergency services workers, hospital staff, mental health professionals, humanitarian aid workers, and social workers (Conrad, 2006; Hunskaer, 2015; Musa, 2008; Sprang, 2007). However, as a concept, compassion fatigue has received little attention in respect of those who have responsibility for caring full time for children who have experienced abuse or neglect and trauma in their own homes, namely foster carers, kinship carers, and adopters. Given that family-based alternative care is the most prevalent type of placement for vulnerable children who cannot live with their birth families, this is particularly surprising (Department for Education, 2020). 

Within studies of carers for children who have experienced abuse/neglect and trauma, elements of compassion fatigue have been described as blocked care (Alper, 2015; Hughes, 2012), and stress and strain, with high levels of stress being identified (Farmer, 2005; Murray, 2011; Selwyn, 2014; Fuentes, 2015). Typical stressors faced by carers and adopters include managing children's emotional needs and challenging behaviour, placement disruptions, allegations, lack of professional support, difficult contact with birth families, social isolation and strained relationships with other family members (Farmer, 2005; Farmer, 2008; Selwyn, 2014; Palacios, 2019). High levels of strain have been associated with low foster carer satisfaction and intention to leave the profession (Sinclair et al., 2004; Farmer, 2005). The concept of compassion fatigue arguably goes further than issues of stress and strain by describing not only the direct effects of supporting people who have experienced trauma (burnout and secondary traumatic stress), but also the wider impact of role satisfaction on mental health and well-being.

As well as living with, experiencing and listening to children's accounts of maltreatment, foster carers aim to promote the child's developmental recovery by providing empathic, attuned parenting. This requires them to engage empathically with the child's experiences of trauma on a regular basis, without the formal clinical supervision provided to therapists who engage in similar emotional labour. Furthermore, because they care for children in their homes, carers have no separation between their work and their home lives, unlike those in other stressful helping professions. Cocker and Joss's (2016) systematic review of compassion fatigue interventions for health care, emergency and community service workers highlighted the fundamental importance of being able to have this separation on a regular basis in order to rest and re-charge from the demands of the role (Cocker, 2016). Regular access to respite that also meets children's needs for consistent care remains challenging in the context of foster care in the UK (Biehal, 2012; McDermid, 2016). Foster carers have also reported that professionals can view requests for respite negatively in terms of perceived commitment to the children and capacity to cope (Farmer, 2008; Ottaway, 2016).

A recent study in 2016, by Ottaway and Selwyn, shed light on the prevalence of compassion fatigue amongst foster carers in England. The study found that 77% of the 546 foster carers studied were suffering some symptoms of compassion fatigue (burnout, secondary trauma and low levels of role satisfaction), which significantly impacted not only on their mental and physical well-being, but also on their ability to provide consistent and emotionally responsive care to the children they looked after. Given that foster care is the most frequent type of out-of-home placement in England for vulnerable children cared for by the state (Department for Education, 2020), it has been important to develop an intervention which aims to lessen the burden on compassion fatigue in the foster parent population.

Participant eligibility criteria
The intervention will be delivered to foster carers who fulfil the following eligibility criteria:
- have moderate to high scores on the burnout and/or secondary trauma scales of the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) Scale (Stamm, 2010) and have low scores on the compassion satisfaction scale 
- currently have children placed in their home on a full-time basis whom they are caring for as foster carers

The intervention will also include the supporting professionals (supervising social workers, children's social workers and fostering team managers) who provide on-going support and supervision to the foster carers in the sample. Social workers who have been qualified for at least 12 months will be eligible to take part if their agency agrees to participate in a trial of the evaluation. Local Authority (LA) fostering agencies and Independent Fostering Agencies (IFA) will be approached to be involved in the evaluation of the intervention. Participating agencies must be open to their foster carers using the principles and techniques of therapeutic parenting to care for children. 

Programme Structure
The intervention will be delivered to foster carers and supporting professionals over a period of three months. The programme involves two separate strands of activity: one strand is delivered to foster carers, the other to supporting professionals (fostering team managers, supervising social workers and children's social workers). The table below summarises the activities involved in each strand:

Strand Activities
Intervention for foster carers:
- One-day compassion fatigue workshop for foster carers 
- One individual session of trauma interruption therapy (Havening)
- Weekly individual empathic listening sessions of up to 1 hour duration for 3 months (12 sessions)
- Monthly peer support meetings for 3 months (3 sessions)

Intervention for supporting professionals:
- Half-day compassion fatigue workshop for supporting professionals 
- Monthly reflective group coaching sessions of up to 2 hours duration for supervising social workers over three months (3 sessions)

Each of these components is described in detail below:

One-day workshop for foster carers
Foster carers will participate in a one-day psychoeducation workshop about compassion fatigue. This workshop is designed to be a first step for participants in recognising, understanding and, ultimately, overcoming compassion fatigue. Participants in our focus groups described their anxieties about appearing &quot;unable to cope&quot; and the stigma and shame they felt at feeling negatively towards the children they were caring for. With this in mind, the workshop aims not only to educate participants about compassion fatigue, but also to destigmatise and normalise the experience of it. As the first stage of the intervention for foster carers, the workshop will also provide a guide to what participants can expect from the other components of the support package (e.g. listening circles and peer support). Foster carers will be introduced to their Listening Circle Coordinators and their Empathic Listener at the workshop, in order to encourage them to engage with the support package as a whole and alleviate any anxiety around making use of the follow up support.

In terms of educational content, the workshop will cover: what CF is and how it relates to burnout and secondary trauma, how CF prevents carers from engaging empathically with children, how to identify the signs CF, how to manage the symptoms of CF by using self-care techniques and by accessing a supportive network of family, friends and other foster carers, and how to prevent further episodes of CF. A key aspect of the workshop involves changing foster carers' attitudes towards respite and self-care. This content is delivered through presentations, group work, role play activities, and training videos. Participants will also receive a copy of 'The A-Z of Therapeutic Parenting: Strategies and Solutions' (Naish, 2018) to take home. The book provides an introduction to the principles and techniques of therapeutic parenting. 

The workshop will be facilitated by NATP trainers who have experience of caring for traumatised children. In the focus groups, carers emphasised that the personal experience of NATP facilitators (who understood the challenges of living with children who have experienced trauma) was particularly important to them. Participants felt that &quot;being with people who get it&quot; helped them three ways: it allowed them to experience empathy from the facilitators who understood what they were going through, it alleviated their sense of social and psychological isolation, and it reduced their feelings of self-blame and stigma. 

Each workshop will be attended by up to 25 foster carers who are based in one region. Because of the importance of being in a supportive environment with people who understand the experience of compassion fatigue and can relate to one another empathically, the workshop will provide ample opportunities for foster carers to interact with one another. Participants will work together to complete structured activities as well as having time to socialise during unstructured breaks. 

Havening (Trauma interruption therapy)
Havening is a trauma interruption therapy which aims to reduce symptoms of primary and secondary trauma. Havening is a novel brief intervention which aims to treat symptoms caused due to traumatic encoding of negative events by using sensory input to alter thoughts and behaviour (Ruden, 2013). During a Havening intervention, a negative event and its associated emotional state are called to mind and the practitioner applies a gentle touch to the forearms, which is coupled with distracting tasks. This process is hypothesised to increase serotonin levels which can disrupt reconsolidation of the link between the traumatic memory of the event and the psychological distress it causes (Gursimran et al., 2015). 

Havening is thought to be appropriate for use with foster carers who are displaying signs of primary trauma due to children's negative externalising behaviour and for those experiencing secondary trauma as a result of engaging empathically with children's experiences of trauma on a regular basis. A small group of foster carers who had previously undergone Havening provided by the NATP participated in this intervention development study. They reported that Havening was effective in reducing distress and anxiety triggered by particular behaviours their children engaged in (for example, aggression or inappropriate touching). However, further research is needed to understand: whether this effect is limited only to very specific behaviours, how long the effect lasts for, and whether it can be casually attributed to the havening intervention itself, rather than to other aspects of the intervention.

The NATP has been delivering Havening for some time now and have an experienced team of practitioners who have been trained to facilitate the intervention. 

Peer support groups (Listening Circles)
Following the one-day workshop, foster carers will take part in a programme of follow-up support. Carers will attend a peer support group, facilitated by the NATP, once a month for three months after the workshop. These groups, known as 'Listening Circles', are currently held across the UK and are attended by NATP members including birth, adoptive, and foster parents, as well as kinship carers. Listening Circles offer participants the opportunity to socialise, share parenting strategies, and access practical and emotional support from peers. This is particularly relevant to foster carers who may find themselves feeling isolated as a result of working within the home environment. 
Listening Circles differ from traditional peer support groups for foster carers in two ways. First, they are attended by other parents/carers (rather than being targeted solely at foster carers). Second, and in contrast with peer support groups facilitated by fostering agencies, Listening Circles are not attended by supervising social workers. Focus group participants were positive about this aspect of the Listening Circles. For many carers, the complex power dynamic between themselves and the social workers who concurrently support and scrutinize them, resulted in them feeling unable to admit when they were struggling. They felt it was important for carers to have safe spaces where they were able to be honest about their experiences and receive non-judgemental support from 'people who get it', without fearing that the routine difficulties of fostering would be documented by their agency and result in interventions from social workers.

Each Listening Circle is facilitated by a volunteer Listening Circle Coordinator (LCC) who schedules the meeting and facilitates discussion. LCCs are trained in safeguarding, confidentiality, and all have experience of therapeutic parenting. LCCs are not paid for their time but expenses are covered and LCCs receive benefits in the form of free NATP annual membership and vouchers to put towards attending NATP training courses. 

Currently Listening Circles vary in their format and structure. Most groups meet in public places such as cafes, but others are held at the LCC's own home. Groups also vary in how structured discussion is; some groups have invited speakers and discuss a particular theme each week, whereas others simply offer a social space for carers to meet and support one another. In order for Listening Circles to be 'trial-ready', a consensus needs to be reached upon which of these two formats is most appropriate for the intervention. Although there is not necessarily a need to manualise the provision of peer support, it is important to ensure enough consistency between groups that we are confident all participants in the intervention group are receiving the same support.

Empathic listening sessions
Alongside attending monthly peer support groups, foster carers will be matched with an 'Empathic Listener'. The role of the Empathic Listener is to provide non-judgemental and empathic listening support to the foster carer. Receiving empathic support is thought to reduce stress and increase capacity for reflective thinking. This is hypothesised to lead to increases in reflective functioning capacity and mind-mindedness, supporting carers to better understand and interpret their children's behaviour. 
Listening sessions will be provided on a weekly basis by telephone, face-to-face, or via Skype, depending on the preferences and availability of the foster carer. The duration of each listening session will be negotiated between Empathic Listeners and foster carers, up to a maximum duration of one hour per week. Empathic listeners will provide independent emotional support to carers. This means that, with the exception of concerns over safeguarding, conversations with Empathic Listeners will remain confidential. 
Empathic Listeners will be employed and trained by the NATP. They will have experience of having therapeutically parented children who have experienced trauma, an awareness and understanding of compassion fatigue, and excellent active listening skills gained from paid or voluntary experience in a relevant field e.g. counselling, social work. Crucially, although some Empathic Listeners may have previously experienced compassion fatigue, they must not currently be suffering symptoms. Before the trial begins, all Empathic Listeners will be assessed using the ProQOL (Stamm, 2010) to ensure that they do not meet the threshold for being in compassion fatigue. In terms of training and support, before the trial begins Empathic Listeners will attend a one-day workshop to learn how to support foster parents. During this workshop, participants will role-play listening sessions to develop and test their skills. Empathic Listeners will also receive monthly group supervision, facilitated by an experienced therapist, to provide clinical supervision and support. 

Half-day workshop for supporting professionals 
Supervising social workers, fostering team managers, and children's social workers will take part in a joint half-day psychoeducation workshop. The aim of the workshop is twofold:
1) To raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of compassion fatigue in foster carers in order to support professionals to identify struggling carers earlier
2) To equip professionals to better support foster carers who are experiencing compassion fatigue.

The workshop will cover: what CF is and how it relates to burnout and secondary trauma, how to identify the signs CF, and how to develop empathic listening skills. The workshop also explores professionals' attitudes towards respite in order to promote the need for foster carers to access regular breaks and opportunities for self-care. This content is delivered through presentations, group work, role play activities, and training videos. 

Participants in our focus groups described the differing priorities between foster carers, social workers who work with foster carers, and those who work with children as a key driver for developing compassion fatigue. Furthermore, a lack of understanding about compassion fatigue and its impact on the carer and caring role, the lack of understanding about a need for regular breaks, and feelings of judgement when carers were experiencing burnout and secondary trauma all contributed to carer difficulties. As well as the educational and awareness raising content of the workshop, the session will bring together professionals from different parts of the fostering system. The aim of this is to encourage cooperation between supervising social workers and children's social workers, and to ensure that managers and the staff they supervise are aligned in terms of their expectations of foster carers. The workshop will be facilitated by three NATP trainers with experience of working in the fostering system.

Reflective group coaching for supervising social workers
Following the workshop, a programme of follow up support in the form of monthly reflective group coaching sessions will be offered to supervising social workers and children's social workers. The aim of these reflective group coaching sessions is to provide social workers with the opportunity to discuss cases where they feel carers are struggling with compassion fatigue. The session will be facilitated by an NATP trainer with experience of practicing as a social worker. Each of these reflective group sessions will involve up to five social workers and will last up to 2 hours. Ideally, these groups will be attended in person but provision may be able to be made for workers to attend remotely. 

Anticipated outcomes
The intervention has a range of proposed short and longer-term outcomes, as follows:
Shorter-term outcomes: Increase in foster carer reflective functioning; reduction in symptoms of compassion fatigue and increase in foster carer role (compassion) satisfaction (as measured by the ProQOL questionnaire at 1 month and 3 months after intervention); reduction in foster carer self-blame/ shame (established through qualitative interview); improved empathic communication with children (measure tbc). 

Longer-term outcomes:
a) Sustained reduction of symptoms of compassion fatigue for 6+ months and sustained increase in foster carer role (compassion) satisfaction for 6+ months (as measured by the ProQOL questionnaire). 
b) Increased family stability (as measured by placement stability, sustained improvement in foster carer reflective functioning; sustained improvement in empathic communication with children; child-focused measures (tbc).

The overall impact of the intervention aims to reduce the prevalence of compassion fatigue in the foster carer population and increase foster carer retention.

Next steps
We are at the stage of finalising outcome and their measurement and the initial cost-benefit analysis prior to seeking funding for the pilot and feasibiity stage of the evalutation process.","None yet - intervention still under development.",,"604922a3235704.18191746","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=604922a3235704.18191746&grantRef=MR%2FR015570%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/R015570/1","36B3AE40-B277-4F59-9B1F-D13DCEE0096B","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","38C5A848-46C9-4B71-A2C7-231151105CFC"

• Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Turner (Veterinary Sciences/BristolBridge) met during the development of the BristolBridge grant application and subsequently (with University of Bristol colleagues) applied for, and were awarded, cross-council AMR Theme 3 funding for NERC-led 'Understanding Real World Interactions'. 
• Homer (Eng. Maths/BristolBridge) and Turner (Vet. Sciences /BristolBridge) had not worked together before BristolBridge and now have a 'plus' funded project together and one with Reyher (Veterinary Sciences)
• Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) met Dillingham (Biochemistry) at the Research Strand 1 Brainstorm event and discussed a project idea that led to preliminary data collection, via two PhD students, which has been submitted for publication in ELife with Dale Wigley (Imperial College) with EPSRC acknowledged, and has been used to support a &pound;1.5M Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award preliminary application (currently in review). 
• Bullock (Computer Science) was introduced (via written introduction) by Spreadbury to Homer (Engineering Maths and Turner (Veterinary Sciences/Social and Community Medicine) and subsequently Reyher (Veterinary Sciences). Their project was successfully funded in the 2nd round when Bullock joined the team and helped develop the proposal. 
• Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences), Barrett and Tisdall (Veterinary Sciences) met at the World Caf&eacute;. They funded a summer student and are now offering an iCASE PhD project with the BBSRC SWBio DTP to work on the infection digital dermatitis in cattle, to be supervised by Barrett, Spencer and Tisdall with Barbour as the industrial partner (Barbour has a spin out company Pertinax Pharma Ltd). 
• Hill (Cellular and Molecular Medicine), Turner (Veterinary Sciences), Muir (Public Health England), Williams (Bristol Royal Infirmary), Crosby (Chemistry), Bullock (Computer Science) and Perriman (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) got together at the World Caf&eacute; to start developing a project to find new ways of treating gonorrhoea. Spreadbury facilitated further meetings to enable them to work up their application and it was funded in our 2nd funding round. Since then, the collaboration has evolved to include Gallagher (Chemistry/Dean of Science) and his PhD student RegoCampello (Chemistry) to work on additional chemistry aspects. Davies (Chemistry) and Hughes-Games (EPSRC-funded Bristol Centre for Functional Materials CDT) and now Hill's PhD student, are working on understanding molecular interactions using atomic force microscopy. Hill's overall project has recently been awarded an extension of 'plus' funding. 
• Hendry (Earth Sciences) was introduced to Avison and Spencer by Spreadbury at the Inaugural Conference so she could discuss her collection of deep sea sponges which may harbour bacteria which produce novel natural products. After preliminary studies with Avison and Spencer over the summer, she is now offering a PhD project on this topic under the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP with Curnow (Biochemistry; lead supervisor), Race (Biochemistry) Avison and Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) and Willis (Chemistry). 
• Miles (Physics and NuNano Ltd) and Borman (Public Health England, National Mycology Reference Lab) met at the Inaugural Conference. Borman saw potential for Miles's technology (presented at the conference) to be applied for detecting antifungal resistance rapidly (their project was funded in 3rd round).

How do the undertaken events/activities relate to the impact and engagement plans detailed in your 'Pathway to Impact' statement?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] • All the events undertaken have helped in breaking down barriers to collaboration and have initiated new collaborations between EPS investigators and microbiologists, clinicians, vets, dentists and life scientists. 
• The cross-strand World Caf&eacute; and Inaugural Conference, in particular, have been instrumental in promoting engagement with clinical (including veterinary) stakeholders - Prof. Alastair Hay, (practising GP, Social and Community Medicine), Prof. Alasadair MacGowan and colleagues at Southmead Hospital, Dr Amber Young (Healing Foundation Children's Burns Centre), Prof. David Barrett (Vet. School), Dr Martin Williams (Bristol Royal Infirmary), Public Health England and the National Mycology Reference Lab (Bristol's clinical microbiology services).
• 'Plus'-funded projects have co-applicants from University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Public Health England and Langford Vets. 
• The critical friend scheme has been implemented by Avison and Spencer to help to discuss scientific issues and develop ideas with PIs who have applied for 'plus' funding but and were not funded. 
• We have increasing interaction with industry (SMEs) which includes formal collaborative research with RedX Pharma (Galan, Spencer &amp; Cooper) and Avison (microbiological testing) and partnerships with Selcia (Spencer and Mulholland) and Pertinax Pharma (Barbour). A keynote lecture was given by Selcia's Director of Drug Discovery at our Inaugural Conference. Diagnostics workshop held with the Institute of Bio-Sensing Technology; meeting with Randox; participation in the EBI Biomedical and Health Sciences Industry Day (Spreadbury on steering committee/hosted a BristolBridge stand &amp; commissioned posters). We have met with the head of KTN Health, Dr Terry O'Neill, and the EEN SW to discuss opportunities for translating outcomes from the most promising 'plus' funded projects. Several activities are planned with the EEN SW including translation and commercialisation surgeries and help with our Industry Day in May 2017. 
• We have launched a BristolBridge AMR CrossFire live streamed video series, devised by Hauert, and hosted on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjZ6fYNvw_8Mhr4OSWCvsSw) as an educational resource to promote cross-disciplinary developments to fight AMR. The videos present basic concepts relevant to AMR research in a way that is accessible, regardless of research background, and in a way that empowers investigators to use this knowledge in their own research.
• Engagement with the public and education has been achieved through holding a Schools Conference on Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance Science for 160 post 16-yr pupils and teachers from the SW region (lectures and hands-on, discovery-led activities). This was organised by BristolBridge (particularly Spreadbury, Spencer &amp; Mulholland) with support from Bristol ChemLabS outreach team; Avison gave a presentation on AMR at the Sidmouth Science Festival 'Science on the Prom' in October 2016 and he also regularly visits schools to talk on AMR (approx. 20 per year); BristolBridge are consultants for Surgeon X AMR comic (http://surgeonx.co.uk/) which is funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). Spreadbury has liaised with and facilitated ongoing communications with author Sara Kenney. Avison recorded podcasts for the Surgeon X app and Mulholland, Hughes ('plus'-funded postdoc) and Walker (Chemical Synthesis PhD student) have all contributed scientific knowledge and expertise to help Kenney develop storylines for a new chemical scientist character. Mulholland, Hughes and Walker also received media training by BBC Radio and social media training by a social media strategist (VCCP Kin) as part of a recent Surgeon X workshop in London. 
• Training - BristolBridge (Spencer, Avison &amp; Murillo - 'plus' funded postdoc) has trained 30 postdoctoral scientists and PhD students predominantly from the engineering and physical sciences in microbiological techniques. Turner and Homer organised a cross-campus R users workshop with the Bristol-based MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit for statistical computing and graphics. Avison was invited by the ESRC to record a video on AMR to help engage social scientists for the ESRC-led AMR Theme 4 funding call. Seddon liaised with Tavar&eacute; to win EBI funding for a clinical immersion programme whereby BCFN students working on 'Materials for Health and the Life Sciences' spent a night shift with the ambulance service to understand how bacterial cross contamination occurs inside an ambulance and how this could inform the design of new nanomaterials to prevent this. 
How have events/activities developed over the course of the award?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] There has been a natural progression from foundation activities leading to more specific and focused activities through to events focused on AMR as a Global Challenge. 
Once the BristolBridge application had been awarded, separate brainstorming sessions (one for each Research Strand) were held during the summer of 2015 to start nucleating investigators from diverse fields of expertise who may have ideas to contribute for collaborative proposals for pump-primimg research in our three Research Strands. 
The official launch presided over by our new Vice Chancellor (a clinician) was a 'call to arms' for the University of Bristol to get involved in tackling AMR and to advertise that 'plus' funding was available for innovative interdisciplinary projects. 
The cross-strand World Caf&eacute; was an event designed to bring all disciplines together to hear the most pressing clinical and veterinary AMR challenges set out by practitioners working in the field; a chance to ask questions (expert panel discussion) and an opportunity to start developing and pitching project proposals linked to our 2nd funding call. 
The Inaugural Conference focused on inviting presentations from engineers, physical scientists and mathematicians to show how their technologies may have potential application in helping to tackle AMR. 
We are now focusing on AMR as a global challenge and we have a month of funded activities planned with investigators from Thailand and SE Asia in March 2017 funded predominantly by our EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 award .

2.Summary and Reflections of 'plus' funding
(see Table 2A in annex to add more event specific detail)
Management of ethical approvals (human and animal)
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] None required to date. The Elizabeth Blackwell Institute for Health Research (EBI) provides oversight and monitoring of the BristolBridge project and advises as required. 
One follow-on funded project by Antognozzi (Physics) has required ethical approval to conduct studies re. clinical validity of his primary care device, but this was undertaken by the School involved (Social and Community Medicine). 
How was (and will) the feasibility funds managed and awarded? Has the strategy evolved over the award?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] The feasibility funds were/are managed by the BristolBridge Manager (Spreadbury), the School of Chemistry's Account Manager (Faculty of Science Finance team) and the Management Group. The Management Group meet every 8 weeks, in addition to networking events, to discuss progress and Review Panel meetings are held to review applications and award funds to 'plus' funded projects. 
The strategy was to front load the BristolBridge project by awarding the majority of 'plus' funding in year 1 in order to maximise the outcomes/impact in year 2. 
How does the research supported so far relate to the original funding application?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] We have funded research across all three Research Strands that were identified in the original funding application. Strand 1 (drug discovery, assays and diagnostics) has received the most funding, so far, with seven funded projects, Strand 2 (antimicrobial materials and devices) has had three funded projects and Strand 3 (AMR surveillance) two funded projects. Some early proposals related to ideas mentioned in the original proposal; but most have arisen from new collaborations initiated through BristolBridge.

Future potential call ideas and scoping activities
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] We believe the Bridging the Gaps programme is a very successful model in Bristol and in other universities. 
We are keen to see follow-on support for this interdisciplinary initiative in AMR. There is real potential for EPS to help combat this global problem. We would suggest an extension of BtG funding with highlighted activities across, and with the other research councils. 
AMR aligns exceptionally well with EPSRC strategies in the Health Technologies Grand Challenges and the Healthy Nation outcome and there is potential here for strategically important areas for EPSRC, ranging from fundamental physical sciences, maths and engineering to technological development and translation. 
We have had three standard calls and one Global Challenge focused call to distribute institutional EPSRC funds where proposals were required to fulfil EPSRC remit and ODA compliance. We have funds remaining for a further (5th) funding round. 
Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Spreadbury (BristolBridge) attended the AHRC Town meeting on 30th November to scope opportunities in Theme 3b of the RCUK cross-council AMR initiative, &quot;Understanding Real World Interactions in the Indoor and Built Environment&quot;. Avison was one of four speakers, covering the topic of &quot;Interdisciplinary AMR Research&quot; 
BristolBridge is applying for a GW4 'Building Communities' Initiator Fund (Bristol lead, Turner) to co-fund a 'bridging the gaps' in AMR workshop with our partners in the GW4 consortium of regional universities: Bath (lead Kasprzyk-Hordern); Cardiff (lead Walsh) and Exeter (lead Gaze). Deadline 9th December. 
We are scoping opportunities in the MRC/RCUK/Newton Fund particularly with our colleague Helen Lambert (ESRC AMR Champion, based in the School of Social and Community Medicine). 
Spencer and Avison have been invited to join the BBSRC Pool of Experts and Mulholland has been invited by the MRC to join AMR Working Group for Phase 2 of cross-council AMR funding.

What strategic opportunities have been highlighted through the network's activities and how do they relate to the AMR initiative/ Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenge activities/ EPSRC Healthy Nation Outcome? 
Max 1 page.
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] Spreadbury is an associate member of the Research Development team in Research and Enterprise Development, and routinely highlights strategic opportunities to the BristolBridge management group and the wider Bristol AMR network. These are promoted across our network through direct emails and via the BristolBridge Newsletter (circulation 213), website and Twitter. She also promotes the other Bridging the Gaps AMR network activities as appropriate. 
Strategic opportunities highlighted include the Longitude Prize, JPIAMR 3rd and 4th calls (one PI applied), AMR cross-council ESRC-led Theme 4 (three applications submitted with Bristol Co-Is), EPSRC GCRF funding awarded to the University of Bristol (one of our PIs was successful, Barbour). AMR cross-council AHRC-led Theme 3b call (Avison and Spreadbury attended Town Meeting to gain further insights/intelligence on the call).
We have also highlighted the recent Dept. Health/Innovate UK Equipment call to build capacity in AMR. An application has been submitted by Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) with MacGowan (North Bristol NHS Trust). 
We were disappointed that Bridging the Gaps funded projects were excluded from applying to the EPSRC &quot;Healthcare Impact Partnerships&quot; call particularly since AMR Theme 2 was one of the strategic themes of the call. Both 'plus' funded Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences/BristolBridge) and Antognozzi (Physics) would have been in a position to apply. 
Turner submitted an EoI for a Fellowship application to EPSRC &quot;Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenges&quot; on &quot;Personalised treatment of infections in community settings to control AMR&quot; and will submit full application in January 2017. 
The EPSRC &quot;New Approaches to Data Science&quot; call has been highlighted to investigators working in our AMR surveillance research strand (Research Strand 3) and One Health (Turner, Homer, Reyher, Bullock, Dowsey and Avison) and we are planning a meeting with the University's newest Research Institute - the Jean Golding Institute for Data Science on the role of data science in tackling AMR. 
We have also canvassed our 'plus' funded PIs and the strategic EPSRC opportunities they have identified for their 'plus' funded projects are predominantly 'Developing Future Therapies' and 'Optimising Treatments' in the Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenge ambitions but all of the Challenge ambitions were represented over our 12 pump-priming projects. In terms of the EPSRC Healthy Nations outcome, our 'plus' funded projects encompass all outcomes (H1-H5). 
What opportunities have arisen as a result of this award that would otherwise not been possible or much harder to achieve?
Max 1 page.
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] This award with its embedded ability to fund networking events, fund pump-priming projects and the salary support for a dedicated Manager to help design and facilitate all BristolBridge activities has meant that BristolBridge has been very successful in achieving its aim to nucleate, stimulate and develop interdisciplinary projects across the University of Bristol and beyond (including bringing in collaborators in LMICs using follow-on funding). We have been able to respond flexibly and act quickly to fund potentially transformative ideas emerging from networking events. 
The BristolBridge award has brought physical scientists, engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists into the AMR arena, and as a result, is applying or developing, new techniques, tools and assays to help tackle AMR on multiple fronts. These projects would have been very difficult to fund elsewhere. 
Additionally, as all the EPS members of the BristolBridge management team are now actively working in the AMR arena, other funding opportunities have since arisen for which they are applying to help tackle AMR problems which they may have not considered before their involvement with BristolBridge. 

4. Any other comments
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ]

BristolBridge has achieved many of its core aims already with the funds awarded and represents excellent value for money for the extent and breadth of interdisciplinary research it has initiated across Bristol. The funding for a full-time Manager and Research Facilitator has been integral to the success of Bristol's bridging the gaps project in year 1. Spreadbury has designed and organised very effective networking events which have generated a lot of interest, and goodwill, from both the EPS and biomedical communities. She independently and successfully manages relationships both within and beyond the network, particularly in relation to creating opportunities for realising impact (e.g. with Colin Cooper at the KCMC, Susie Williams at the EEN SW, Sara Kenney at Surgeon X/Wowbagger productions and new contacts in Thailand regarding liaison for our 'Bristol Tackling Global Challenges' week). She is an associate member of the Research Development (RD) Team in Research and Enterprise Development (RED) and attends their bi-monthly team meetings. This has enabled her to receive intelligence on RCUK's and other funding opportunities and benefit from wider issues discussed surrounding research development/follow-on funding. Her close links with the RD team means that the Faculty Research Development Managers and Institute Managers in all six Faculties and the four University Research Institutes (EBI, Cabot, Brigstowe and Jean Golding), respectively, are regularly apprised of BristolBridge's activities and funding calls and this helps to inform a campus-wide audience. She has also engaged members of the RD team to attend BristolBridge events which has been helpful in raising awareness of wider AMR funding opportunities. The BristolBridge project has expanded into related areas of AMR research and Spreadbury works closely with other players to facilitate further networking/potential funding opportunities - e.g. helping to engage the BristolBridge network with the ESRC AMR Champion's (Lambert) joint and reciprocal Bristol-Aarhus University workshop on interdisciplinary AMR working. BristolBridge initiated &quot;Bristol Tackling Global Challenges&quot; on receipt of its EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship funding for a joint Bristol-Thailand AMR workshop and Spreadbury is currently working with the BrisSynBio Manager, Sedgley, to expand this to incorporate a week of related BrisSynBio workshops funded via the BBSRC GCRF on Natural Product Discovery in SE Asia (Project Co-lead Mulholland) and Vaccine Development (Project Co-lead Turner). 
The BristolBridge management group members and 'plus' funded PIs have attended other Bridging the Gaps AMR network activities. Mulholland and Spreadbury attended the NAMRA/NAMRIP meeting in Southampton on 25/08/15. Su (Oral and Dental Sciences) gave an invited talk on &quot;Bioinspired antimicrobial surfaces for medical implants&quot; at the SHAMROK workshop on Antimicrobial Surfaces in Sheffield on 06/04/16; Seddon and Spreadbury attended the Annual AMR Networks meeting at Sheffield on 02/09/16; Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences) attended the Antimicrobial Research Collaborative (ARC) Conference at Imperial College on 22/09/16 and Reyher (Veterinary Sciences) gave an invited presentation on &quot;How can auditing supply chains address the responsible use of antibiotics&quot; at the NAMRIP and Food Standards Agency (FSA) meeting on 'Food retailers, supply chains and the antimicrobial resistance challenge' in London on 25/11/16. 
Finally, the BristolBridge PI (Mulholland) and Co-Is (Avison, Spencer, Seddon, Barbour, Hauert, Turner, Homer and Tavar&eacute;) also have their own AMR and AMR-related research activities, which while not directly supported by BristolBridge 'plus' funding activities, have benefited from additional collaboration through BristolBridge, involving new investigators which help to inform BristolBridge and its wider activities within the University. Many are PIs and Co-Is on other major AMR grants:

Activity Inaugural BristolBridge Conference held at Engineers House, Bristol on &quot;Meeting the Challenge of Antimicrobial Resistance through the Advances in the Engineering and Physical Sciences&quot;
1st most expensive
2nd most influential 
Date 08/04/16
Aim To showcase the first pump-priming projects we had funded and also to demonstrate how physical sciences and engineering technologies, techniques and tools could be applied to tackling AMR. Physicists, engineers, mathematicians, modellers and bioinformaticians were invited to give presentations along with clinicians and industry. Posters and flash presentations by postdocs and PhD students were also invited. 
Target Audience University of Bristol academics, postdoctoral researchers, PhD students, industry, NHS Trusts, other Bridging the Gaps network projects. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 107 people attended. 
Audience: Faculty Deans, academics, postdocs, PhD students, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, industry, research council (EPSRC), Research Development and Research Commercialisation Managers.
11 institutions: University of Bristol, University of the West of England (UWE), University of Bath, Aston University (AMR4AMR), Imperial College (EMBRACE), University of Liverpool, EPSRC (Dr Jane Nicholson), Selcia Ltd (Dr Vicky Steadman, Director of Drug Discovery), Institute of Bio-Sensing Technology, Healing Children's Burns Research Centre (based at the Bristol Children's Hospital), Public Health England National Mycology Reference Laboratory. 
Disciplines: Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, Engineering Maths, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Social and Community Medicine, Veterinary Sciences, Oral and Dental Sciences
Outputs: New collaborations resulting in three applications for 'plus' funded projects (proposals by PIs Miles (Physics) and Seddon (Physics/BristolBridge) were subsequently funded) and preliminary studies resulting in offered PhD project with the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP (Curnow, Hendry, Race, Spencer, Avison and Willis). 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement A conference was part of our planning as detailed in the Case and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration 
Engagement with clinical stakeholders
Increasing interaction with industry 
Successes Spreadbury and Spencer worked up their idea, facilitated by Seddon, Turner and Homer, to involve and engage Bristol's physical scientists and engineers (none of those invited had 'plus' funding at that stage) to give presentations on their technologies which may have potential application in helping to tackle AMR. This was instrumental in showcasing Bristol's EPS community and bringing them directly into contact with their biomedical counterparts. 
The team successfully worked together to shape the programme. For the external and keynote presentations, Spreadbury invited Dr Andrew Dowsey (then University of Liverpool but due to take up a Chair at Bristol in July 2016) to present his data science approach to 'One Health'. He is now collaborating widely with Turner, Reyher (Veterinary Sciences) and Avison on AMR surveillance and diagnostics. Spencer successfully engaged the Director of Drug Discovery at Selcia Ltd (Dr Vicky Steadman), Barbour engaged Dr Amber Young from the Healing Foundation Children's Burns Research Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Turner engaged Prof. Ed Feil (Bath) and Seddon suggested Gallagher (Dean of Science/Chemistry) to close the meeting and his participation was secured by Mulholland. 
The conference resulted in new collaborations being made which generated 3 applications for 'plus' funding and the award of 2 pump-priming projects for Miles (Physics) with Borman (National Mycology Reference Lab) and Seddon (Physics/BristolBridge), Hughes (Mech. Eng) and Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge). 
Seddon, Hughes and Spencer's 'plus' funded project has been extended by one month; they have also expanded the remit of their work to bring in Turner (Vet Sciences/Social and Community Medicine/BristolBridge) and Gibson (Biological Sciences) and attracted further funding via EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 support which also supports collaborative links with Thailand and Kenya and funding for collaborative visits. 
Hendry (Earth Sciences) was introduced to Spencer and Avison (both Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) which led to meetings, preliminary studies and an offered PhD project on &quot;New antimicrobials from deep sea sponges&quot; with the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP.

Challenges No major challenges
Summary
 A very successful first conference with a wide range of attendees from the University and other institutions. The enthusiastic input from the researchers presenting the results from the first pump-priming projects, PhD students and postdocs (giving 'flash' 3 minute oral presentations and posters) lent another exciting dimension. 
Feedback: &quot;The BristolBridge team has fostered a really good community of interesting, interested, proactive and collegiate researchers, and you are to be highly commended for it!&quot;
&quot;It was a pleasure and a privilege to talk at such a fascinating and high quality meeting. I very much enjoyed it and was amazed by some of the science taking place&quot;.
&quot;The day was extremely enjoyable. It was a pleasure to hear of the breadth and depth of the research and also to have the chance to talk to the presenters and other University of Bristol academics. In particular, I greatly enjoyed talking to people from such a wide interdisciplinary collection of topics in a relaxed atmosphere&quot;.

Activity Cross-strand World Caf&eacute; at Bristol Zoo Gardens
2nd most expensive
1st most influential
Date 19/01/16
Aim 1. To set out the challenge of AMR from the perspective of healthcare professionals in primary care, secondary care and veterinary medicine in farming and livestock production for investigators outside the field to understand what problems need to be addressed. 
2. Facilitated World Caf&eacute; session to brainstorm questions relating to specific challenges/problems followed by reporting discussion outcome to the room.
3. Expert panel discussion (clinical &amp; EPS panellists) - audience told that &quot;no question is too stupid to ask&quot; 
4. Small group working to start developing interdisciplinary pump-priming projects and short project pitches 
Target Audience Cross-Faculty University of Bristol academics particularly those working in engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, microbiology/infectious diseases, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, clinical microbiologists working in NHS hospital pathology laboratories. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 75 people attended 
Audience: Academic staff from 4 of the 6 University of Bristol Faculties (Biomedical Sciences, Health Sciences, Science and Engineering), postdoctoral research staff, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, clinical microbiologists from Public Health England pathology labs, Research Development Managers and other Project Managers (e.g. from the Centre of Academic Primary Care). 
5 Institutions: University of Bristol, University of Swansea, Public Health England, North Bristol NHS Trust (Southmead Hospital) and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust (Bristol Royal Infirmary) 
Disciplines: Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering Mathematics, Computer Science, Complexity Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Veterinary Sciences, Oral and Dental Sciences and Social and Community Medicine. 
Outputs: New collaborative proposals, for example from: 
Hill, Crosby, Perriman, Turner, Williams and colleagues
Picco, Payton and Leeming 
Bullock, Reyher, Brooks-Pollock, Tasker and Danon

12 applications for 'plus' funding 
Barbour, Barrett, Spencer and Tisdall now have a joint iCASE PhD project 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement A World Caf&eacute; event was part of our planning as detailed in the Case and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration
Engagement with clinical stakeholders
Successes An atmosphere buzzing with enthusiasm and a commitment to tackle AMR. Holding the event away from the University meant that people were focused on the aims of the event and stayed the whole day. The surroundings and catering at Bristol Zoo Gardens also contributed to the success of the event and the feeling of both goodwill and a valuable day spent away from the office/lab. Many academics commented on how liberating it was to spend a whole day discussing research. 
Spreadbury initiated and secured the participation of Prof. Alastair Hay, a practising GP and Professor of Primary Care (Social and Community Medicine) and Prof. David Barrett Professor of Bovine Medicine, Reproduction and Production (Veterinary Sciences). Spencer secured Prof Alasdair MacGowan, Professor of Antimicrobial Therapeutics, North Bristol NHS Trust. Spreadbury worked with them all to ensure they understood that their particular role was to highlight the challenges of AMR from their clinical/veterinary perspectives in a way that a diverse audience of different expertises could understand. They all gave superb keynote clinical presentations and participated in all the day's activities. 
6 projects were informally pitched and new collaborations were initiated. Some went on to develop applications for 'plus' funds - 12 applications received in funding round 2. 
55% increase in submitted applications compared to the first funding round.
For more details on this event, please see: 
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/2016/cross-strand-amr-world-cafe.html
Challenges The short amount of time to pinpoint the key areas which needed to be discussed after challenges were set out in the clinical and veterinary keynote presentations 
Summary
 The World Caf&eacute; was viewed, and is still viewed, as a very successful event which employed a format for the day which was both highly engaging and productive. The official launch was inspiring but the World Caf&eacute; embedded the view by Bristol investigators that BristolBridge events were worth attending. Subsequently, the conference was very well attended too and smaller workshops and training events have been similarly well patronised. 
We heard that the event was much discussed with people who could not/did not attend and it was also flagged at a School Research Committee meeting as being a highly successful event. 
It was satisfying to see that many attendees had ideas for projects they wanted to discuss with potential new collaborators they had met during the day and self-organised groups quickly fell into place. During small group working, ideas for projects emerged very quickly and six exciting project proposals were pitched by the end of the afternoon
Feedback: A facilitator commented that &quot;There seemed to be a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm for collaborating and making exciting things happen&quot;. 
Turner (Veterinary Sciences/BristolBridge) reported &quot;Lots of people said afterwards how collaborative and willing people were to go a bit outside their comfort zones and ask stupid/obvious questions. So easy to forget we don't all know about atomic force microscopy and synovial fluid. I heard lots of questions asked that would have been difficult or impossible in another context - if that's not bridging the gaps I don't know what is&quot;.

Activity BristolBridge Official Launch
4th most expensive
3rd most influential
Date 11/11/15
Aim To officially launch the BristolBridge project to the University of Bristol. A 'call to arms' to encourage investigators in the physical sciences, mathematics and engineering disciplines to engage with their counterparts in the life sciences, human and veterinary medicine to tackle the problem of AMR. The idea for a launch came from Avison who sensed that interest may have waned since the brainstorming sessions held in the summer and the time taken to appoint the Manager and Research Facilitator (Spreadbury) who took up her post in October. 
Target Audience University of Bristol and Bristol NHS Trusts 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 130 people attended
Audience: The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Hugh Brady; the Pro Vice Chancellor (Research) Prof. Nishan Canagarajah, the Deans and (some) Faculty Research Directors of the Faculties of Engineering, Science, Biomedical Sciences and Health Sciences, academics, postdoctoral researchers, PhD students including from the BCFN and ACCIS Centres for Doctoral Training, Heads of School, Research and Enterprise Development, Finance staff involved in the original application
3 Institutions: University of Bristol, North Bristol NHS Trust and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust 

Disciplines: Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering Maths, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Complexity Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Veterinary Sciences, Oral and Dental Sciences, Social and Community Medicine 
Outputs: The excellent and engaging talks by Brady, Tavar&eacute;, Avison, Mulholland and Lambert, the excellent vibe and good humoured atmosphere - and complimentary wine and food - generated a lot of goodwill and laid the foundation for investigators to be interested in attending future BristolBridge events and undertake interdisciplinary working.
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement An official launch event was not part of our planning as detailed in the Case but clearly an excellent format to attract diverse expertise and galvanise interdisciplinary collaboration. The launch meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration 
Engagement with cinical stakeholders
Successes Spreadbury engaging the new Vice Chancellor to preside over the launch. The successful design and organisation (at fairly short notice) of the launch event by Spreadbury and its promotion by Spreadbury and Mulholland, in particular, to ensure an excellent turnout and a large number of poster presentations. Thought provoking and engaging presentations in which Brady gave a thoughtful opening address reflecting on his clinical experience and frustration at seeing his former renal patients die of infection and how opportune BristolBridge was in tackling the the problem of AMR. Tavar&eacute; (Elizabeth BIackwell Institute/BristolBridge) praised the highly collaborative and collegiate research environment at Bristol which would help to engender the interdisciplinary research needed to ensure BristolBridge's mission to bridge the gaps between the EPS and biomedical communities. Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge) poignantly reminded the audience that the launch was being held on Remembrance Day and that World War II was the dawn of the antibiotic era; an era which heralded modern medicine, and now, just 80 years later, has left us facing an antibiotic apocalypse. Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) outlined the challenge of the problem, the need to understand transmission of AMR in the environment and the role we can all play in reducing antibiotic overuse and stewardship of the antibiotics we have. He also showcased the wider AMR research already taking place at the University of Bristol in tackling this. Lambert - the ESRC National AMR Champion (Social and Community Medicine) highlighted the importance of social science in helping to tackle AMR in an interdisciplinary manner. Mulholland concluded by launching the second funding round. For more details on this event, please see:
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/2015/official-launch.html
Challenges No major challenges but a lot of energy and commitment required from Spreadbury and Mulholland, in particular, to ensure as wide participation as possible. 
Summary
 A vibrant event which got everyone talking about the challenge of AMR and enthusiastic about tackling the problem in interdisciplinary ways. Tavar&eacute; (Elizabeth Blackwell Institute/BristolBridge) challenged everyone to discuss at least one idea for tackling the problem of AMR with another attendee during the wine and cheese reception which followed the presentations. The event helped to publicise BristolBridge and its aims and also generated a lot of goodwill for future networking events and appetite for applying for 'plus' funding. The design and format of the launch was pivotal in generating a very positive, high energy atmosphere with lots of opportunity for extensive networking (pre-event welcome drinks and poster presentations too).

Activity Visit by RedX Pharma 
4th most expensive 
4th most influential? Hard to judge but arguably the most influential in terms of impact re. industrial engagement 
Date 11-12th May 2016
Aim To follow up on a visit initiated by Colin Cooper (KCMC Manager/School of Chemistry) and made by both Cooper and Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge) in February 2016. RedX were interested in collaborating to help them overcome some problems with an antimicrobial compound they were trying to repurpose from Gram-positive to broader activity. They were also interested in engaging help from our Chemistry colleagues to help overcome a formulation problem with a lead compound. 
Following the execution of a mutual confidentiality agreement between the University of Bristol and RedX Pharma (facilitated by Cooper and Spreadbury), we invited three of them to spend two days in Bristol to discuss mutually beneficial research. 
Target Audience Two part visit: Dinner with RedX delegates attended by Gallagher (Dean of Science/School of Chemistry), Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry), Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge), Spencer, Avison (both Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Spreadbury (BristolBridge)
Day 2 workshop: PIs and Co-Is from 'plus' funded projects, particularly relating to microbiology and drug discovery, at the University of Bristol were invited and PIs from the School of Chemistry were invited who would be able to advise and collaborate. 
RedX Pharma's Business Development and Alliance Manager, Dr Kate Lower, gave an introductory presentation about RedX Pharma's portfolio of research for drug discovery and two scientists gave presentations outlining the problems they required collaborative help with. 
The RedX visitors toured the School of Chemistry research facilities and had one-to-one meetings with several academics. 
We also invited Bailey and Lazarus (Biological Sciences and Co-Is on 'plus' funded BristolBridge project) and PI and Co-I, respectively, on AMR cross-council Theme 2 funded consortium award on &quot;Exploring Natures Silent Pharmacy&quot; to give a presentation on their work for a systems-based platform for the production of novel antibiotics. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 15 people attended the workshop
Audience: Senior academics (PI/Co-I) from the Schools of Chemistry, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry and Biological Sciences. 
Disciplines: Microbiology, drug discovery investigators, chemists including experts in NMR, computational chemistry, materials chemistry, organic chemistry (molecular conformation), synthetic and biological chemistry 
Outputs: New collaborations and funding as Carmen Galan (Chemistry), Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry) went on to successfully apply for an EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 funded project. 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement Stimulating interactions with industry was planned in our Case and this event meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Increasing interaction with industry
Successes An example of proactive and professional industrial engagement initiated by Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry and facilitated by Cooper, Mulholland and Spreadbury for the benefit of BristolBridge and other investigators based in the School of Chemistry. 
Chemists led by Craig Butts (Chemistry) undertook contract research to solve a significant problem with a lead compound. 
Galan (Chemistry), Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry) went on to successfully apply for an EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 funded project. 
Challenges The only challenge was finding a date when all the most important stakeholders could attend. 
Summary
 A productive and mutually beneficial visit by RedX Pharma resulting in a funded collaborative project and an impact already generated by our colleagues in the School of Chemistry who have helped to solve a problem with one of RedX Pharma's lead compounds. This industrial-academic transaction has added value and greatly enhanced our relationship with this pharmaceutical company which may potentially lead to preferred or even strategic collaborations in the future. 
Of direct relevance to AMR, was the help required by RedX from University of Bristol investigators to help repurpose an antimicrobial compound. This resulted in a successful application to EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 for Galan, Spencer and Cooper and are now successfully collaborating with RedX to try and achieve this aim.

Activity Schools Conference on Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance Science
5th most expensive
Influence unknown but potentially far reaching and impactful 
Date 09/11/16
Aim To educate and engage the public about antibiotics and AMR with presentations from academics and PhD students working in the field. This was organised by BristolBridge with support from the ChemLabS outreach team (Director, Tim Harrison) 
Target Audience Post 16-year old science pupils and their teachers
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 160 attended. 
Audience: Post 16-year old pupils (studying AS and A-level Biology and Chemistry) and teachers attended from 9 schools across the southwest region (Bristol, Somerset, Wiltshire and Cornwall)
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement This event was part of our planning as detailed in the Case to educate school age children and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Engagement with the public and education
Successes Seeing the pupils engage so ethusiastically with the demonstrations and activities and also with the PhD students who were running the demonstrations. 
Reading the comments from the pupils to see that Avison's lecture had informed them about antibiotics, AMR and how drug resistant infections occur. Excellent feedback; the teachers particularly liked the demos which ranged from a virtual reality molecular simulation of ß-lactamase to swarming robots to model bacterial biofilms. 
For more details on this event, please see: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/schools-conference-on-antibiotics-and-antibiotic-resistance-science.html 
An article on our Schools Conference will be submitted in March 2017 to be included in the September 2017 issue of Science in School (the European Journal for science teachers http://www.scienceinschool.org/ 
Challenges Mostly organisational - a lot of facilitation and coordination required to develop ideas and the realisation of hands-on, discovery-led activities and demonstrations. 
Summary
 Presentations by Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) on &quot;The rise and fall of antibiotics&quot;. Paul Walker (Chem Synthesis CDT PhD student) gave a talk on &quot;How do we make new antibiotics&quot; and Catherine Tooke (BBSRC SWBio DTP PhD student) gave a talk on &quot;Nerds vs. antibiotic resistance: Can we use computers to outsmart resistance?&quot; (presented by Mulholland as she was unavailable on the day). The PhD students presenting talks were encouraged to inform the audience about their choices at A-level, degree etc so the pupils could understand their journey into STEM and postgraduate research. 
Hands-on, discovery led demonstrations were given by staff and postgraduates from four Faculties: 
Nano Simbox - Simulations of the Molecular Nano World (Interactive Science Ltd (iSci) and School of Chemistry)
Modelling bacteria using robot swarms (Dept. Engineering Maths &amp; Bristol Robotics Lab)
How penicillin works (Schools of Cellular &amp; Molecular Medicine and Chemistry) 
The bacterial evolution and medicinal chemistry &quot;Arms Race&quot; (School of Cellular &amp; Molecular Medicine and Dept. Engineering Maths) 
Bugs under the microscope (School of Cellular &amp; Molecular Medicine) 
Maths can help fight AMR too! (Dept. Engineering Maths and School of Veterinary Sciences) 
Bacteria get everywhere! How can we design materials to repel them? (Bristol Centre for Functional Materials, School of Physics) 
Game Zone - Play the Superbugs game (BristolBridge)
Antimicrobial resistance - tell us what you know (BristolBridge)
 A very successful event to engage young people which helped to change their attitudes to antibiotics and AMR e.g. &quot;I'm going to wash my hands more because I don't wanna die&quot;; &quot;I realise now how much we need/should reduce the use of antibiotics&quot;; &quot; Never realised how close and urgent this whole issue is&quot;; &quot;Antibiotics need to be used less in farming&quot;; &quot;Not as hopeless as I thought. Excited by the new technology that can help!&quot;
Teacher's feedback: &quot;Many thanks indeed for such an enjoyable and illuminating and relevant afternoon; our girls had been looking forward to this for many weeks! Super and engaging demonstrations and it really made the curriculum come to life. We, as ever, were welcome and the sessions were especially well organised. Our girls especially relished meeting PhD students and learning about their research at the University of Bristol. The lectures were thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening; we have had our horizons broadened! All in all a superb afternoon&quot;.","New collaborations that have emerged through BristolBridge: 
• Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Turner (Veterinary Sciences/BristolBridge) met during the development of the BristolBridge grant application and subsequently (with University of Bristol colleagues) applied for, and were awarded, cross-council AMR Theme 3 funding for NERC-led 'Understanding Real World Interactions'. 
• Homer (Eng. Maths/BristolBridge) and Turner (Vet. Sciences /BristolBridge) had not worked together before BristolBridge and now have a 'plus' funded project together and one with Reyher (Veterinary Sciences)
• Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) met Dillingham (Biochemistry) at the Research Strand 1 Brainstorm event and discussed a project idea that led to preliminary data collection, via two PhD students, which has been submitted for publication in ELife with Dale Wigley (Imperial College) with EPSRC acknowledged, and has been used to support a &pound;1.5M Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award preliminary application (currently in review). 
• Bullock (Computer Science) was introduced (via written introduction) by Spreadbury to Homer (Engineering Maths and Turner (Veterinary Sciences/Social and Community Medicine) and subsequently Reyher (Veterinary Sciences). Their project was successfully funded in the 2nd round when Bullock joined the team and helped develop the proposal. 
• Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences), Barrett and Tisdall (Veterinary Sciences) met at the World Caf&eacute;. They funded a summer student and are now offering an iCASE PhD project with the BBSRC SWBio DTP to work on the infection digital dermatitis in cattle, to be supervised by Barrett, Spencer and Tisdall with Barbour as the industrial partner (Barbour has a spin out company Pertinax Pharma Ltd). 
• Hill (Cellular and Molecular Medicine), Turner (Veterinary Sciences), Muir (Public Health England), Williams (Bristol Royal Infirmary), Crosby (Chemistry), Bullock (Computer Science) and Perriman (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) got together at the World Caf&eacute; to start developing a project to find new ways of treating gonorrhoea. Spreadbury facilitated further meetings to enable them to work up their application and it was funded in our 2nd funding round. Since then, the collaboration has evolved to include Gallagher (Chemistry/Dean of Science) and his PhD student RegoCampello (Chemistry) to work on additional chemistry aspects. Davies (Chemistry) and Hughes-Games (EPSRC-funded Bristol Centre for Functional Materials CDT) and now Hill's PhD student, are working on understanding molecular interactions using atomic force microscopy. Hill's overall project has recently been awarded an extension of 'plus' funding. 
• Hendry (Earth Sciences) was introduced to Avison and Spencer by Spreadbury at the Inaugural Conference so she could discuss her collection of deep sea sponges which may harbour bacteria which produce novel natural products. After preliminary studies with Avison and Spencer over the summer, she is now offering a PhD project on this topic under the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP with Curnow (Biochemistry; lead supervisor), Race (Biochemistry) Avison and Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) and Willis (Chemistry). 
• Miles (Physics and NuNano Ltd) and Borman (Public Health England, National Mycology Reference Lab) met at the Inaugural Conference. Borman saw potential for Miles's technology (presented at the conference) to be applied for detecting antifungal resistance rapidly (their project was funded in 3rd round).
• Gersen (Physics) and Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) built a new collaboration to submit a proposal for our 2nd funding round (funded). 
• Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) met Cooper (KCMC) through Spreadbury and Mulholland and Spencer &amp; Cooper have a collaborative project with Galan (Chemistry) and RedX Pharma funded by EPSRC Insititutional Sponsorship 2016.

How do the undertaken events/activities relate to the impact and engagement plans detailed in your 'Pathway to Impact' statement?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] • All the events undertaken have helped in breaking down barriers to collaboration and have initiated new collaborations between EPS investigators and microbiologists, clinicians, vets, dentists and life scientists. 
• The cross-strand World Caf&eacute; and Inaugural Conference, in particular, have been instrumental in promoting engagement with clinical (including veterinary) stakeholders - Prof. Alastair Hay, (practising GP, Social and Community Medicine), Prof. Alasadair MacGowan and colleagues at Southmead Hospital, Dr Amber Young (Healing Foundation Children's Burns Centre), Prof. David Barrett (Vet. School), Dr Martin Williams (Bristol Royal Infirmary), Public Health England and the National Mycology Reference Lab (Bristol's clinical microbiology services).
• 'Plus'-funded projects have co-applicants from University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Public Health England and Langford Vets. 
• The critical friend scheme has been implemented by Avison and Spencer to help to discuss scientific issues and develop ideas with PIs who have applied for 'plus' funding but and were not funded. 
• We have increasing interaction with industry (SMEs) which includes formal collaborative research with RedX Pharma (Galan, Spencer &amp; Cooper) and Avison (microbiological testing) and partnerships with Selcia (Spencer and Mulholland) and Pertinax Pharma (Barbour). A keynote lecture was given by Selcia's Director of Drug Discovery at our Inaugural Conference. Diagnostics workshop held with the Institute of Bio-Sensing Technology; meeting with Randox; participation in the EBI Biomedical and Health Sciences Industry Day (Spreadbury on steering committee/hosted a BristolBridge stand &amp; commissioned posters). We have met with the head of KTN Health, Dr Terry O'Neill, and the EEN SW to discuss opportunities for translating outcomes from the most promising 'plus' funded projects. Several activities are planned with the EEN SW including translation and commercialisation surgeries and help with our Industry Day in May 2017. 
• We have launched a BristolBridge AMR CrossFire live streamed video series, devised by Hauert, and hosted on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjZ6fYNvw_8Mhr4OSWCvsSw) as an educational resource to promote cross-disciplinary developments to fight AMR. The videos present basic concepts relevant to AMR research in a way that is accessible, regardless of research background, and in a way that empowers investigators to use this knowledge in their own research.
• Engagement with the public and education has been achieved through holding a Schools Conference on Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance Science for 160 post 16-yr pupils and teachers from the SW region (lectures and hands-on, discovery-led activities). This was organised by BristolBridge (particularly Spreadbury, Spencer &amp; Mulholland) with support from Bristol ChemLabS outreach team; Avison gave a presentation on AMR at the Sidmouth Science Festival 'Science on the Prom' in October 2016 and he also regularly visits schools to talk on AMR (approx. 20 per year); BristolBridge are consultants for Surgeon X AMR comic (http://surgeonx.co.uk/) which is funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). Spreadbury has liaised with and facilitated ongoing communications with author Sara Kenney. Avison recorded podcasts for the Surgeon X app and Mulholland, Hughes ('plus'-funded postdoc) and Walker (Chemical Synthesis PhD student) have all contributed scientific knowledge and expertise to help Kenney develop storylines for a new chemical scientist character. Mulholland, Hughes and Walker also received media training by BBC Radio and social media training by a social media strategist (VCCP Kin) as part of a recent Surgeon X workshop in London. 
• Training - BristolBridge (Spencer, Avison &amp; Murillo - 'plus' funded postdoc) has trained 30 postdoctoral scientists and PhD students predominantly from the engineering and physical sciences in microbiological techniques. Turner and Homer organised a cross-campus R users workshop with the Bristol-based MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit for statistical computing and graphics. Avison was invited by the ESRC to record a video on AMR to help engage social scientists for the ESRC-led AMR Theme 4 funding call. Seddon liaised with Tavar&eacute; to win EBI funding for a clinical immersion programme whereby BCFN students working on 'Materials for Health and the Life Sciences' spent a night shift with the ambulance service to understand how bacterial cross contamination occurs inside an ambulance and how this could inform the design of new nanomaterials to prevent this. 
How have events/activities developed over the course of the award?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] There has been a natural progression from foundation activities leading to more specific and focused activities through to events focused on AMR as a Global Challenge. 
Once the BristolBridge application had been awarded, separate brainstorming sessions (one for each Research Strand) were held during the summer of 2015 to start nucleating investigators from diverse fields of expertise who may have ideas to contribute for collaborative proposals for pump-primimg research in our three Research Strands. 
The official launch presided over by our new Vice Chancellor (a clinician) was a 'call to arms' for the University of Bristol to get involved in tackling AMR and to advertise that 'plus' funding was available for innovative interdisciplinary projects. 
The cross-strand World Caf&eacute; was an event designed to bring all disciplines together to hear the most pressing clinical and veterinary AMR challenges set out by practitioners working in the field; a chance to ask questions (expert panel discussion) and an opportunity to start developing and pitching project proposals linked to our 2nd funding call. 
The Inaugural Conference focused on inviting presentations from engineers, physical scientists and mathematicians to show how their technologies may have potential application in helping to tackle AMR. 
We are now focusing on AMR as a global challenge and we have a month of funded activities planned with investigators from Thailand and SE Asia in March 2017 funded predominantly by our EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 award .

2.Summary and Reflections of 'plus' funding
(see Table 2A in annex to add more event specific detail)
Management of ethical approvals (human and animal)
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] None required to date. The Elizabeth Blackwell Institute for Health Research (EBI) provides oversight and monitoring of the BristolBridge project and advises as required. 
One follow-on funded project by Antognozzi (Physics) has required ethical approval to conduct studies re. clinical validity of his primary care device, but this was undertaken by the School involved (Social and Community Medicine). 
How was (and will) the feasibility funds managed and awarded? Has the strategy evolved over the award?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] The feasibility funds were/are managed by the BristolBridge Manager (Spreadbury), the School of Chemistry's Account Manager (Faculty of Science Finance team) and the Management Group. The Management Group meet every 8 weeks, in addition to networking events, to discuss progress and Review Panel meetings are held to review applications and award funds to 'plus' funded projects. 
The strategy was to front load the BristolBridge project by awarding the majority of 'plus' funding in year 1 in order to maximise the outcomes/impact in year 2. 
How does the research supported so far relate to the original funding application?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] We have funded research across all three Research Strands that were identified in the original funding application. Strand 1 (drug discovery, assays and diagnostics) has received the most funding, so far, with seven funded projects, Strand 2 (antimicrobial materials and devices) has had three funded projects and Strand 3 (AMR surveillance) two funded projects. Some early proposals related to ideas mentioned in the original proposal; but most have arisen from new collaborations initiated through BristolBridge.

Future potential call ideas and scoping activities
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] We believe the Bridging the Gaps programme is a very successful model in Bristol and in other universities. 
We are keen to see follow-on support for this interdisciplinary initiative in AMR. There is real potential for EPS to help combat this global problem. We would suggest an extension of BtG funding with highlighted activities across, and with the other research councils. 
AMR aligns exceptionally well with EPSRC strategies in the Health Technologies Grand Challenges and the Healthy Nation outcome and there is potential here for strategically important areas for EPSRC, ranging from fundamental physical sciences, maths and engineering to technological development and translation. 
We have had three standard calls and one Global Challenge focused call to distribute institutional EPSRC funds where proposals were required to fulfil EPSRC remit and ODA compliance. We have funds remaining for a further (5th) funding round. 
Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Spreadbury (BristolBridge) attended the AHRC Town meeting on 30th November to scope opportunities in Theme 3b of the RCUK cross-council AMR initiative, &quot;Understanding Real World Interactions in the Indoor and Built Environment&quot;. Avison was one of four speakers, covering the topic of &quot;Interdisciplinary AMR Research&quot; 
BristolBridge is applying for a GW4 'Building Communities' Initiator Fund (Bristol lead, Turner) to co-fund a 'bridging the gaps' in AMR workshop with our partners in the GW4 consortium of regional universities: Bath (lead Kasprzyk-Hordern); Cardiff (lead Walsh) and Exeter (lead Gaze). Deadline 9th December. 
We are scoping opportunities in the MRC/RCUK/Newton Fund particularly with our colleague Helen Lambert (ESRC AMR Champion, based in the School of Social and Community Medicine). 
Spencer and Avison have been invited to join the BBSRC Pool of Experts and Mulholland has been invited by the MRC to join AMR Working Group for Phase 2 of cross-council AMR funding.

What strategic opportunities have been highlighted through the network's activities and how do they relate to the AMR initiative/ Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenge activities/ EPSRC Healthy Nation Outcome? 
Max 1 page.
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] Spreadbury is an associate member of the Research Development team in Research and Enterprise Development, and routinely highlights strategic opportunities to the BristolBridge management group and the wider Bristol AMR network. These are promoted across our network through direct emails and via the BristolBridge Newsletter (circulation 213), website and Twitter. She also promotes the other Bridging the Gaps AMR network activities as appropriate. 
Strategic opportunities highlighted include the Longitude Prize, JPIAMR 3rd and 4th calls (one PI applied), AMR cross-council ESRC-led Theme 4 (three applications submitted with Bristol Co-Is), EPSRC GCRF funding awarded to the University of Bristol (one of our PIs was successful, Barbour). AMR cross-council AHRC-led Theme 3b call (Avison and Spreadbury attended Town Meeting to gain further insights/intelligence on the call).
We have also highlighted the recent Dept. Health/Innovate UK Equipment call to build capacity in AMR. An application has been submitted by Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) with MacGowan (North Bristol NHS Trust). 
We were disappointed that Bridging the Gaps funded projects were excluded from applying to the EPSRC &quot;Healthcare Impact Partnerships&quot; call particularly since AMR Theme 2 was one of the strategic themes of the call. Both 'plus' funded Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences/BristolBridge) and Antognozzi (Physics) would have been in a position to apply. 
Turner submitted an EoI for a Fellowship application to EPSRC &quot;Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenges&quot; on &quot;Personalised treatment of infections in community settings to control AMR&quot; and will submit full application in January 2017. 
The EPSRC &quot;New Approaches to Data Science&quot; call has been highlighted to investigators working in our AMR surveillance research strand (Research Strand 3) and One Health (Turner, Homer, Reyher, Bullock, Dowsey and Avison) and we are planning a meeting with the University's newest Research Institute - the Jean Golding Institute for Data Science on the role of data science in tackling AMR. 
We have also canvassed our 'plus' funded PIs and the strategic EPSRC opportunities they have identified for their 'plus' funded projects are predominantly 'Developing Future Therapies' and 'Optimising Treatments' in the Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenge ambitions but all of the Challenge ambitions were represented over our 12 pump-priming projects. In terms of the EPSRC Healthy Nations outcome, our 'plus' funded projects encompass all outcomes (H1-H5). 
What opportunities have arisen as a result of this award that would otherwise not been possible or much harder to achieve?
Max 1 page.
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] This award with its embedded ability to fund networking events, fund pump-priming projects and the salary support for a dedicated Manager to help design and facilitate all BristolBridge activities has meant that BristolBridge has been very successful in achieving its aim to nucleate, stimulate and develop interdisciplinary projects across the University of Bristol and beyond (including bringing in collaborators in LMICs using follow-on funding). We have been able to respond flexibly and act quickly to fund potentially transformative ideas emerging from networking events. 
The BristolBridge award has brought physical scientists, engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists into the AMR arena, and as a result, is applying or developing, new techniques, tools and assays to help tackle AMR on multiple fronts. These projects would have been very difficult to fund elsewhere. 
Additionally, as all the EPS members of the BristolBridge management team are now actively working in the AMR arena, other funding opportunities have since arisen for which they are applying to help tackle AMR problems which they may have not considered before their involvement with BristolBridge. 

4. Any other comments
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ]

BristolBridge has achieved many of its core aims already with the funds awarded and represents excellent value for money for the extent and breadth of interdisciplinary research it has initiated across Bristol. The funding for a full-time Manager and Research Facilitator has been integral to the success of Bristol's bridging the gaps project in year 1. Spreadbury has designed and organised very effective networking events which have generated a lot of interest, and goodwill, from both the EPS and biomedical communities. She independently and successfully manages relationships both within and beyond the network, particularly in relation to creating opportunities for realising impact (e.g. with Colin Cooper at the KCMC, Susie Williams at the EEN SW, Sara Kenney at Surgeon X/Wowbagger productions and new contacts in Thailand regarding liaison for our 'Bristol Tackling Global Challenges' week). She is an associate member of the Research Development (RD) Team in Research and Enterprise Development (RED) and attends their bi-monthly team meetings. This has enabled her to receive intelligence on RCUK's and other funding opportunities and benefit from wider issues discussed surrounding research development/follow-on funding. Her close links with the RD team means that the Faculty Research Development Managers and Institute Managers in all six Faculties and the four University Research Institutes (EBI, Cabot, Brigstowe and Jean Golding), respectively, are regularly apprised of BristolBridge's activities and funding calls and this helps to inform a campus-wide audience. She has also engaged members of the RD team to attend BristolBridge events which has been helpful in raising awareness of wider AMR funding opportunities. The BristolBridge project has expanded into related areas of AMR research and Spreadbury works closely with other players to facilitate further networking/potential funding opportunities - e.g. helping to engage the BristolBridge network with the ESRC AMR Champion's (Lambert) joint and reciprocal Bristol-Aarhus University workshop on interdisciplinary AMR working. BristolBridge initiated &quot;Bristol Tackling Global Challenges&quot; on receipt of its EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship funding for a joint Bristol-Thailand AMR workshop and Spreadbury is currently working with the BrisSynBio Manager, Sedgley, to expand this to incorporate a week of related BrisSynBio workshops funded via the BBSRC GCRF on Natural Product Discovery in SE Asia (Project Co-lead Mulholland) and Vaccine Development (Project Co-lead Turner). 
The BristolBridge management group members and 'plus' funded PIs have attended other Bridging the Gaps AMR network activities. Mulholland and Spreadbury attended the NAMRA/NAMRIP meeting in Southampton on 25/08/15. Su (Oral and Dental Sciences) gave an invited talk on &quot;Bioinspired antimicrobial surfaces for medical implants&quot; at the SHAMROK workshop on Antimicrobial Surfaces in Sheffield on 06/04/16; Seddon and Spreadbury attended the Annual AMR Networks meeting at Sheffield on 02/09/16; Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences) attended the Antimicrobial Research Collaborative (ARC) Conference at Imperial College on 22/09/16 and Reyher (Veterinary Sciences) gave an invited presentation on &quot;How can auditing supply chains address the responsible use of antibiotics&quot; at the NAMRIP and Food Standards Agency (FSA) meeting on 'Food retailers, supply chains and the antimicrobial resistance challenge' in London on 25/11/16. 
Finally, the BristolBridge PI (Mulholland) and Co-Is (Avison, Spencer, Seddon, Barbour, Hauert, Turner, Homer and Tavar&eacute;) also have their own AMR and AMR-related research activities, which while not directly supported by BristolBridge 'plus' funding activities, have benefited from additional collaboration through BristolBridge, involving new investigators which help to inform BristolBridge and its wider activities within the University. Many are PIs and Co-Is on other major AMR grants:

Increasing interaction with industry 
Successes Spreadbury and Spencer worked up their idea, facilitated by Seddon, Turner and Homer, to involve and engage Bristol's physical scientists and engineers (none of those invited had 'plus' funding at that stage) to give presentations on their technologies which may have potential application in helping to tackle AMR. This was instrumental in showcasing Bristol's EPS community and bringing them directly into contact with their biomedical counterparts. 
The team successfully worked together to shape the programme. For the external and keynote presentations, Spreadbury invited Dr Andrew Dowsey (then University of Liverpool but due to take up a Chair at Bristol in July 2016) to present his data science approach to 'One Health'. He is now collaborating widely with Turner, Reyher (Veterinary Sciences) and Avison on AMR surveillance and diagnostics. Spencer successfully engaged the Director of Drug Discovery at Selcia Ltd (Dr Vicky Steadman), Barbour engaged Dr Amber Young from the Healing Foundation Children's Burns Research Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Turner engaged Prof. Ed Feil (Bath) and Seddon suggested Gallagher (Dean of Science/Chemistry) to close the meeting and his participation was secured by Mulholland. 
The conference resulted in new collaborations being made which generated 3 applications for 'plus' funding and the award of 2 pump-priming projects for Miles (Physics) with Borman (National Mycology Reference Lab) and Seddon (Physics/BristolBridge), Hughes (Mech. Eng) and Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge). 
Seddon, Hughes and Spencer's 'plus' funded project has been extended by one month; they have also expanded the remit of their work to bring in Turner (Vet Sciences/Social and Community Medicine/BristolBridge) and Gibson (Biological Sciences) and attracted further funding via EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 support which also supports collaborative links with Thailand and Kenya and funding for collaborative visits. 
Hendry (Earth Sciences) was introduced to Spencer and Avison (both Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) which led to meetings, preliminary studies and an offered PhD project on &quot;New antimicrobials from deep sea sponges&quot; with the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP.

Challenges No major challenges
Summary
 A very successful first conference with a wide range of attendees from the University and other institutions. The enthusiastic input from the researchers presenting the results from the first pump-priming projects, PhD students and postdocs (giving 'flash' 3 minute oral presentations and posters) lent another exciting dimension. 
Feedback: &quot;The BristolBridge team has fostered a really good community of interesting, interested, proactive and collegiate researchers, and you are to be highly commended for it!&quot;
&quot;It was a pleasure and a privilege to talk at such a fascinating and high quality meeting. I very much enjoyed it and was amazed by some of the science taking place&quot;.
&quot;The day was extremely enjoyable. It was a pleasure to hear of the breadth and depth of the research and also to have the chance to talk to the presenters and other University of Bristol academics. In particular, I greatly enjoyed talking to people from such a wide interdisciplinary collection of topics in a relaxed atmosphere&quot;.

Activity Cross-strand World Caf&eacute; at Bristol Zoo Gardens
2nd most expensive
1st most influential
Date 19/01/16
Aim 1. To set out the challenge of AMR from the perspective of healthcare professionals in primary care, secondary care and veterinary medicine in farming and livestock production for investigators outside the field to understand what problems need to be addressed. 
2. Facilitated World Caf&eacute; session to brainstorm questions relating to specific challenges/problems followed by reporting discussion outcome to the room.
3. Expert panel discussion (clinical &amp; EPS panellists) - audience told that &quot;no question is too stupid to ask&quot; 
4. Small group working to start developing interdisciplinary pump-priming projects and short project pitches 
Target Audience Cross-Faculty University of Bristol academics particularly those working in engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, microbiology/infectious diseases, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, clinical microbiologists working in NHS hospital pathology laboratories. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 75 people attended 
Audience: Academic staff from 4 of the 6 University of Bristol Faculties (Biomedical Sciences, Health Sciences, Science and Engineering), postdoctoral research staff, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, clinical microbiologists from Public Health England pathology labs, Research Development Managers and other Project Managers (e.g. from the Centre of Academic Primary Care). 
5 Institutions: University of Bristol, University of Swansea, Public Health England, North Bristol NHS Trust (Southmead Hospital) and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust (Bristol Royal Infirmary)

12 applications for 'plus' funding 
Barbour, Barrett, Spencer and Tisdall now have a joint iCASE PhD project 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement A World Caf&eacute; event was part of our planning as detailed in the Case and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration
Engagement with clinical stakeholders
Successes An atmosphere buzzing with enthusiasm and a commitment to tackle AMR. Holding the event away from the University meant that people were focused on the aims of the event and stayed the whole day. The surroundings and catering at Bristol Zoo Gardens also contributed to the success of the event and the feeling of both goodwill and a valuable day spent away from the office/lab. Many academics commented on how liberating it was to spend a whole day discussing research. 
Spreadbury initiated and secured the participation of Prof. Alastair Hay, a practising GP and Professor of Primary Care (Social and Community Medicine) and Prof. David Barrett Professor of Bovine Medicine, Reproduction and Production (Veterinary Sciences). Spencer secured Prof Alasdair MacGowan, Professor of Antimicrobial Therapeutics, North Bristol NHS Trust. Spreadbury worked with them all to ensure they understood that their particular role was to highlight the challenges of AMR from their clinical/veterinary perspectives in a way that a diverse audience of different expertises could understand. They all gave superb keynote clinical presentations and participated in all the day's activities. 
6 projects were informally pitched and new collaborations were initiated. Some went on to develop applications for 'plus' funds - 12 applications received in funding round 2. 
55% increase in submitted applications compared to the first funding round.
For more details on this event, please see: 
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/2016/cross-strand-amr-world-cafe.html
Challenges The short amount of time to pinpoint the key areas which needed to be discussed after challenges were set out in the clinical and veterinary keynote presentations 
Summary
 The World Caf&eacute; was viewed, and is still viewed, as a very successful event which employed a format for the day which was both highly engaging and productive. The official launch was inspiring but the World Caf&eacute; embedded the view by Bristol investigators that BristolBridge events were worth attending. Subsequently, the conference was very well attended too and smaller workshops and training events have been similarly well patronised. 
We heard that the event was much discussed with people who could not/did not attend and it was also flagged at a School Research Committee meeting as being a highly successful event. 
It was satisfying to see that many attendees had ideas for projects they wanted to discuss with potential new collaborators they had met during the day and self-organised groups quickly fell into place. During small group working, ideas for projects emerged very quickly and six exciting project proposals were pitched by the end of the afternoon
Feedback: A facilitator commented that &quot;There seemed to be a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm for collaborating and making exciting things happen&quot;. 
Turner (Veterinary Sciences/BristolBridge) reported &quot;Lots of people said afterwards how collaborative and willing people were to go a bit outside their comfort zones and ask stupid/obvious questions. So easy to forget we don't all know about atomic force microscopy and synovial fluid. I heard lots of questions asked that would have been difficult or impossible in another context - if that's not bridging the gaps I don't know what is&quot;.

Activity BristolBridge Official Launch
4th most expensive
3rd most influential
Date 11/11/15
Aim To officially launch the BristolBridge project to the University of Bristol. A 'call to arms' to encourage investigators in the physical sciences, mathematics and engineering disciplines to engage with their counterparts in the life sciences, human and veterinary medicine to tackle the problem of AMR. The idea for a launch came from Avison who sensed that interest may have waned since the brainstorming sessions held in the summer and the time taken to appoint the Manager and Research Facilitator (Spreadbury) who took up her post in October. 
Target Audience University of Bristol and Bristol NHS Trusts 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 130 people attended
Audience: The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Hugh Brady; the Pro Vice Chancellor (Research) Prof. Nishan Canagarajah, the Deans and (some) Faculty Research Directors of the Faculties of Engineering, Science, Biomedical Sciences and Health Sciences, academics, postdoctoral researchers, PhD students including from the BCFN and ACCIS Centres for Doctoral Training, Heads of School, Research and Enterprise Development, Finance staff involved in the original application
3 Institutions: University of Bristol, North Bristol NHS Trust and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust 

Disciplines: Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering Maths, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Complexity Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Veterinary Sciences, Oral and Dental Sciences, Social and Community Medicine 
Outputs: The excellent and engaging talks by Brady, Tavar&eacute;, Avison, Mulholland and Lambert, the excellent vibe and good humoured atmosphere - and complimentary wine and food - generated a lot of goodwill and laid the foundation for investigators to be interested in attending future BristolBridge events and undertake interdisciplinary working.
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement An official launch event was not part of our planning as detailed in the Case but clearly an excellent format to attract diverse expertise and galvanise interdisciplinary collaboration. The launch meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration 
Engagement with cinical stakeholders
Successes Spreadbury engaging the new Vice Chancellor to preside over the launch. The successful design and organisation (at fairly short notice) of the launch event by Spreadbury and its promotion by Spreadbury and Mulholland, in particular, to ensure an excellent turnout and a large number of poster presentations. Thought provoking and engaging presentations in which Brady gave a thoughtful opening address reflecting on his clinical experience and frustration at seeing his former renal patients die of infection and how opportune BristolBridge was in tackling the the problem of AMR. Tavar&eacute; (Elizabeth BIackwell Institute/BristolBridge) praised the highly collaborative and collegiate research environment at Bristol which would help to engender the interdisciplinary research needed to ensure BristolBridge's mission to bridge the gaps between the EPS and biomedical communities. Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge) poignantly reminded the audience that the launch was being held on Remembrance Day and that World War II was the dawn of the antibiotic era; an era which heralded modern medicine, and now, just 80 years later, has left us facing an antibiotic apocalypse. Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) outlined the challenge of the problem, the need to understand transmission of AMR in the environment and the role we can all play in reducing antibiotic overuse and stewardship of the antibiotics we have. He also showcased the wider AMR research already taking place at the University of Bristol in tackling this. Lambert - the ESRC National AMR Champion (Social and Community Medicine) highlighted the importance of social science in helping to tackle AMR in an interdisciplinary manner. Mulholland concluded by launching the second funding round. For more details on this event, please see:
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/2015/official-launch.html
Challenges No major challenges but a lot of energy and commitment required from Spreadbury and Mulholland, in particular, to ensure as wide participation as possible. 
Summary
 A vibrant event which got everyone talking about the challenge of AMR and enthusiastic about tackling the problem in interdisciplinary ways. Tavar&eacute; (Elizabeth Blackwell Institute/BristolBridge) challenged everyone to discuss at least one idea for tackling the problem of AMR with another attendee during the wine and cheese reception which followed the presentations. The event helped to publicise BristolBridge and its aims and also generated a lot of goodwill for future networking events and appetite for applying for 'plus' funding. The design and format of the launch was pivotal in generating a very positive, high energy atmosphere with lots of opportunity for extensive networking (pre-event welcome drinks and poster presentations too).

Activity Visit by RedX Pharma 
4th most expensive 
4th most influential? Hard to judge but arguably the most influential in terms of impact re. industrial engagement 
Date 11-12th May 2016
Aim To follow up on a visit initiated by Colin Cooper (KCMC Manager/School of Chemistry) and made by both Cooper and Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge) in February 2016. RedX were interested in collaborating to help them overcome some problems with an antimicrobial compound they were trying to repurpose from Gram-positive to broader activity. They were also interested in engaging help from our Chemistry colleagues to help overcome a formulation problem with a lead compound. 
Following the execution of a mutual confidentiality agreement between the University of Bristol and RedX Pharma (facilitated by Cooper and Spreadbury), we invited three of them to spend two days in Bristol to discuss mutually beneficial research. 
Target Audience Two part visit: Dinner with RedX delegates attended by Gallagher (Dean of Science/School of Chemistry), Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry), Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge), Spencer, Avison (both Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Spreadbury (BristolBridge)
Day 2 workshop: PIs and Co-Is from 'plus' funded projects, particularly relating to microbiology and drug discovery, at the University of Bristol were invited and PIs from the School of Chemistry were invited who would be able to advise and collaborate. 
RedX Pharma's Business Development and Alliance Manager, Dr Kate Lower, gave an introductory presentation about RedX Pharma's portfolio of research for drug discovery and two scientists gave presentations outlining the problems they required collaborative help with. 
The RedX visitors toured the School of Chemistry research facilities and had one-to-one meetings with several academics. 
We also invited Bailey and Lazarus (Biological Sciences and Co-Is on 'plus' funded BristolBridge project) and PI and Co-I, respectively, on AMR cross-council Theme 2 funded consortium award on &quot;Exploring Natures Silent Pharmacy&quot; to give a presentation on their work for a systems-based platform for the production of novel antibiotics. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 15 people attended the workshop
Audience: Senior academics (PI/Co-I) from the Schools of Chemistry, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry and Biological Sciences. 
Disciplines: Microbiology, drug discovery investigators, chemists including experts in NMR, computational chemistry, materials chemistry, organic chemistry (molecular conformation), synthetic and biological chemistry 
Outputs: New collaborations and funding as Carmen Galan (Chemistry), Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry) went on to successfully apply for an EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 funded project. 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement Stimulating interactions with industry was planned in our Case and this event meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Increasing interaction with industry
Successes An example of proactive and professional industrial engagement initiated by Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry and facilitated by Cooper, Mulholland and Spreadbury for the benefit of BristolBridge and other investigators based in the School of Chemistry. 
Chemists led by Craig Butts (Chemistry) undertook contract research to solve a significant problem with a lead compound. 
Galan (Chemistry), Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry) went on to successfully apply for an EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 funded project. 
Challenges The only challenge was finding a date when all the most important stakeholders could attend. 
Summary
 A productive and mutually beneficial visit by RedX Pharma resulting in a funded collaborative project and an impact already generated by our colleagues in the School of Chemistry who have helped to solve a problem with one of RedX Pharma's lead compounds. This industrial-academic transaction has added value and greatly enhanced our relationship with this pharmaceutical company which may potentially lead to preferred or even strategic collaborations in the future. 
Of direct relevance to AMR, was the help required by RedX from University of Bristol investigators to help repurpose an antimicrobial compound. This resulted in a successful application to EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 for Galan, Spencer and Cooper and are now successfully collaborating with RedX to try and achieve this aim.

Activity Schools Conference on Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance Science
5th most expensive
Influence unknown but potentially far reaching and impactful 
Date 09/11/16
Aim To educate and engage the public about antibiotics and AMR with presentations from academics and PhD students working in the field. This was organised by BristolBridge with support from the ChemLabS outreach team (Director, Tim Harrison) 
Target Audience Post 16-year old science pupils and their teachers
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 160 attended. 
Audience: Post 16-year old pupils (studying AS and A-level Biology and Chemistry) and teachers attended from 9 schools across the southwest region (Bristol, Somerset, Wiltshire and Cornwall)
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement This event was part of our planning as detailed in the Case to educate school age children and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Engagement with the public and education
Successes Seeing the pupils engage so ethusiastically with the demonstrations and activities and also with the PhD students who were running the demonstrations. 
Reading the comments from the pupils to see that Avison's lecture had informed them about antibiotics, AMR and how drug resistant infections occur. Excellent feedback; the teachers particularly liked the demos which ranged from a virtual reality molecular simulation of ß-lactamase to swarming robots to model bacterial biofilms. 
For more details on this event, please see: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/schools-conference-on-antibiotics-and-antibiotic-resistance-science.html 
An article on our Schools Conference will be submitted in March 2017 to be included in the September 2017 issue of Science in School (the European Journal for science teachers http://www.scienceinschool.org/ 
Challenges Mostly organisational - a lot of facilitation and coordination required to develop ideas and the realisation of hands-on, discovery-led activities and demonstrations. 
Summary
 Presentations by Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) on &quot;The rise and fall of antibiotics&quot;. Paul Walker (Chem Synthesis CDT PhD student) gave a talk on &quot;How do we make new antibiotics&quot; and Catherine Tooke (BBSRC SWBio DTP PhD student) gave a talk on &quot;Nerds vs. antibiotic resistance: Can we use computers to outsmart resistance?&quot; (presented by Mulholland as she was unavailable on the day). The PhD students presenting talks were encouraged to inform the audience about their choices at A-level, degree etc so the pupils could understand their journey into STEM and postgraduate research. 
Hands-on, discovery led demonstrations were given by staff and postgraduates from four Faculties: 
Nano Simbox - Simulations of the Molecular Nano World (Interactive Science Ltd (iSci) and School of Chemistry)
Modelling bacteria using robot swarms (Dept. Engineering Maths &amp; Bristol Robotics Lab)
How penicillin works (Schools of Cellular &amp; Molecular Medicine and Chemistry) 
The bacterial evolution and medicinal chemistry &quot;Arms Race&quot; (School of Cellular &amp; Molecular Medicine and Dept. Engineering Maths) 
Bugs under the microscope (School of Cellular &amp; Molecular Medicine) 
Maths can help fight AMR too! (Dept. Engineering Maths and School of Veterinary Sciences) 
Bacteria get everywhere! How can we design materials to repel them? (Bristol Centre for Functional Materials, School of Physics) 
Game Zone - Play the Superbugs game (BristolBridge)
Antimicrobial resistance - tell us what you know (BristolBridge)
 A very successful event to engage young people which helped to change their attitudes to antibiotics and AMR e.g. &quot;I'm going to wash my hands more because I don't wanna die&quot;; &quot;I realise now how much we need/should reduce the use of antibiotics&quot;; &quot; Never realised how close and urgent this whole issue is&quot;; &quot;Antibiotics need to be used less in farming&quot;; &quot;Not as hopeless as I thought. Excited by the new technology that can help!&quot;
Teacher's feedback: &quot;Many thanks indeed for such an enjoyable and illuminating and relevant afternoon; our girls had been looking forward to this for many weeks! Super and engaging demonstrations and it really made the curriculum come to life. We, as ever, were welcome and the sessions were especially well organised. Our girls especially relished meeting PhD students and learning about their research at the University of Bristol. The lectures were thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening; we have had our horizons broadened!

The adaptive real time intelligent system to enhance self-care of chronic disease (ARISES) is a novel platform capable of collecting data from multiple sources to empower people to effectively self-manage type 1 diabetes (T1DM) through therapeutic and lifestyle decision support (figure 1). Combining wearable sensors and smartphone technology, a range of biological, environmental and behavioural data will feedback into an artificial intelligence algorithm to output real-time decision support.

The first phase of clinical trials will recruit 12 individuals with T1DM for a six-week observational study. This study will serve as a training set using wearable technologies to collect data and evaluate blood glucose correlations against physiological and environmental case parameters. Useful associations will assist the development of the ARISES algorithm and identify wearable devices for the final ARISES platform. This study will also provide questionnaire and feasibility outcomes for combining both CGM and a physiological data acquisition sensor. 

Glucose levels will be monitored using Dexcom G6 real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT CGM). Physiological parameters (heart rate, blood volume pulse, skin temperature, motion and sympathetic activity, and electrodermal activity) will be monitored using the Empatica E4 wristband. Data from both wearable devices will be uploaded anonymously to a safe cloud-based server for analysis. Participants will be asked to log manual data inputs (e.g. exercise details, meal macronutrients, alcohol content and illness) into the mySugr smartphone applications for retrospective analysis. On completion of the study, location and ambient temperature data will be retrospectively accessed from myTracks app and smartphone location features.","We will have physiological data including glucose, heart rate, activity, skin temperature over a 6 week period in 10 people with diabetes.

The game aims to influence social norms, knowledge and attitude surrounding HIV/AIDs and challenge the belief that you can no longer live a long and fulfilling life after a positive diagnosis. It contrasts this by demonstrating the risk to your health by delaying or refusing testing and treatment services. Health messages are communicated across 90 unique levels and 10 animated stories. Players can earn power-ups to help them defeat levels by answering in-game questions. The game also features an extensive menu which includes a global leader board, information on each of the icons in the game and links to relevant information on HIV testing and treatment services. Using an iterative development process, informed through qualitative research with end users, the game took 10 months to develop from the technical prototype. 
The pilot game is freely available for download on the Google Play and App store.
The game development was funded by the Newton Agham Programme.","The approach used for the development of Battle in the Blood was successful in improving key features of the game and can be applied to any game for health, provided the learning objectives and target audience for the game have been specified. This approach can also be used to optimise Battle in the Blood for use in different contexts.

2019 update: Research conducted through the project has demonstrated that Battle in the Blood is accepted by target users and has a positive influence over knowledge and attitudes towards HIV services and people living with HIV in the Philippines. A qualitative exploratory study has identified cases in which the game has triggered positive health seeking behaviours. Factors that have contributed to the game's performance have been identified and will be used to develop validated strategies for the roll out and sustainability of games for health in lower- and middle-income countries.","https://etch.lstmed.ac.uk/games/battle-in-the-blood-bitb","5a9434d96c9005.71920787","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=5a9434d96c9005.71920787&grantRef=MR%2FN019202%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/N019202/1","2A5DA6C2-EC2B-4372-9E0C-EAB5FE49B9E1","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3ED60B49-9C2B-4D71-B644-96CCC7F10194","52F76F91-B778-4D33-AE08-13007F88B0E3"

The vaccine has been refined to comprise two components. Small scale field trials with this vaccine are underway. Studies to model how the vaccine might be applied and operate under field conditions in the UK are also being completed. Patents are secured, seed stocks and methodologies for upscale have been established and a Target Product Profile completed.","The major cause of parasitic gastroenteritis (PGE) in small ruminants in temperate regions worldwide is the parasitic nematode, Teladorsagia circumcincta. This pathogen is acquired by ingestion of infective third stage larvae from pasture and, thereafter, the developing parasites and adult worms reside in the abomasum, where a combination of nematode-induced damage and a host inflammatory/immune responses result in a protein-losing gastropathy. The major effect of infection with this parasite is on lamb productivity causing a reduction in live-weight gain; worm infection early in life has a significant impact on lamb body fat and protein deposition as a result of a reduction in the efficiency of metabolisable energy used for growth. The additional cost of lamb finishing time, assuming a 10% reduction in daily weight gain resulting from PGE, is substantial and was recently estimated as &pound;4.40 per lamb. Protective immunity to T. circumcincta develops after exposure to the parasite over a period of weeks; however, the degree of immunity acquired is dependent on the level of parasite challenge, age of the animal and its genotype (Singleton et al., 2011). In practice, immunity usually develops too late to prevent the parasite's negative effects on lamb productivity. 

T. circumcincta infection is currently controlled using anthelmintics; however, resistance to Class I to III products (benzimidazoles, levamisoles and macrocyclic lactones) is rife and multi-class resistant isolates have been reported. Of further concern are the field reports of resistance to one of the two new classes of anthelmintic. As an alternative method of control, we have developed a recombinant vaccine for T. circumcincta which has been shown to induce significant levels of protective immunity across a range of pen trials in lambs and ewes. Reductions in faecal egg output observed in our studies will have a substantial impact on downstream pasture contamination and could play a central role in the delivery of sustainable integrated nematode control programs on sheep farms across the globe.",,"5c8915da243462.44460780","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=5c8915da243462.44460780&grantRef=BB%2FM011968%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/M011968/1","0B58D03D-6F5A-4B59-A482-67C9A77BAFAE","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","A54B1700-DBA3-40ED-B4DF-34E3B24C0BAE","589CA7A8-4514-470A-9F7E-23EDF71C66FC"

First, a presentation of a mobile Augmented Reality point to point measurement system which has been deployed on a commercially available depth-perception (TOF-CW) enabled tablet utilising active range sensors and the passive-parallax approaches. Second, an evaluation of the indoor measurement accuracy of the system through Occupational Therapists (OTs) who stand at the forefront of manual and hand based indoor object measurements in comparison with a 2D state of the art paper-based guidance leaflet which is currently used in practice. The evaluation aims to establish the relative efficiency and effectiveness of the system in conjunction with its feasibility and perceptions in terms of user satisfaction and attitudes towards adopting and using this new technology in practice.

Preliminary results indicate the measurements of the system in comparison with the guidance leaflet are within the acceptable margin identified to be 5 cm's in OT practice settings. However, the margin identified is one of lax requirements and will form part of one of the recommendations to further improve upon by the OT community. Additionally, the measurements captured by the system have provided in-depth Point-Cloud data sets that can be further processed using Mathematical/Computer Science concepts such as K-Means Nearest neighbours and Euclidean distances in attempts to provide the user with visual ques when performing digital measurements to improve overall accuracy.

The new and improved version of the system will be subject to a further trial in clinical settings and establish the research users (older adults) views with adoption of this system for assessment either in collaboration with OTs or self-efficiency in absence of the clinician. 

Developments of the open-sourced tablet technology has been depreciated and replaced with a more ubiquitous device that fits into the pocket. The replacement technologies' ethos as identified by the developers, steers away from enabling detailed and accurate scans of environmental Point Cloud Data and instead focuses on the user experience of the device with similar hardware and software features. 

The replacement technology, in combination with the preliminary results provide even more incentive for the research community to invest larger efforts into algorithmic and novel software-based solutions to provide accurate point-to-point measurement technology. To this end, integrating open-sourced technology that can be maintained by the community, instead of large conglomerates driven by capital gain, can provide massive cost-saving opportunities for both the public sector and governmental strategies whilst providing care to patients that have access to free health-care information on the internet and have started asking better-informed questions.

Funding opportunities remain within the current EPSRC grant as the project and system development is still ongoing.","The main focus of the development process is to analyse the current captured data sets from the trials and align this with current OTs expectations in terms of system design and applicability.

Background - High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) is an effective treatment for this younger patient group. Unlike knee replacement, it preserves the native joint by re-aligning the tibia and redistributing the painful high-pressure regions within the knee. HTO clinical outcomes depend on the accuracy of the procedure, which is complex and surgically demanding. Current HTO solutions are one-size-fits-all resulting in post-operative complications related to the standardised nature of the plates.
3D-Metal Printing (3D-MP) use additive manufacturing (AM) technology to create complex and bespoke geometries, a low energy, environmentally responsible process with minimal material waste. Combining AM with digital technology 3D-MP developed TOKA (Tailored Osteotomy Knee Alignment), a precision-engineered patient-specific HTO treatment for knee Osteoarthritis (OA). It allows surgeons to precisely achieve the planned correction using a combination of intuitive 3D planning and custom-made, minimally invasive devices for superior patient comfort. Thus, providing a significant improvement to healthcare providers' treatment options.

At Cardiff University the Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Research Facility (MSKBRF) was established as part of a Welsh funded bid and includes the state of the art, &pound;1.6M dynamic, bi-plane X-Ray facility. This system is used to capture high-speed 2D X-ray of dynamic motions or activities of in-vivo joint biomechanics.

The Biomechanics and Bioengineering Research Centre Versus Arthritis (BBRCVA) at Cardiff University has led HTO studies for the last 10 years to understand altered loading in the knee OA in terms of the links between biomechanics, biology, and clinical measures. Longitudinal studies have been performed to measure, quantify and compare lower leg and trunk biomechanics to understand the way patients with medial compartment OA alter their gait, and other activities of daily living in response to their degenerative knee joint disease. Additional comparisons between biomechanical function taken pre- surgery to those that result post-operatively are performed to understand the effects of knee realignment surgery on offloading the medial compartment of the knee in order to alleviate the effects of the osteoarthritis in the bone and cartilage and other stabilising structures. Alongside this the effects of non-surgical gait alteration to offload the diseased compartment of the knee are being investigated. 

During these studies BBRCVA have worked alongside orthopaedic surgeons (at C&amp;V UHB) who have collected and collated clinical data on the patients who have biomechanics and biological data, allowing relationships to be identified between biomechanics and clinical knee alignment. A previous Knee Fellow who collated this information went on to establish the UK's first Osteotomy Registry (UKKOR) and interested in tibial osteotomy has risen extensively since the work started on the HTO study as a Flagship Study for the BBRC Versus Arthritis.

The OATech+ funded an Imaging Group project to develop new, bespoke dual plane dynamic X-ray imaging protocols (D Williams), focussed on extremity joints (knee, hand/wrist/ankle/foot). As a result of this Research Feasibility Study, these protocols have been adapted for the TOKA project allowing, for the first time, in vivo imaging pre- post HTO for patients having either a standard or a TOKA fixation plate.

Aims - The Personalised Against Standard High tibial Osteotomy (PASHiOn) trial started in 2021 - as part of a study funded by Versus Arthritis and led by Prof Gill (Bath University). This trial, led by Oxford University Clinical Trials Research Unit, is a two-group blinded randomised trial that will be conducted on 88 patients comparing TOKA to standard HTO. A cohort of 22 randomised patients are receiving treatment in Cardiff as part of the double-blind study. 

This proposed study is undertaking additional in-vivo biomechanical analysis at the MSKBRF on the Cardiff cohort to provide additional valuable insight on how the surgery changes contact positions of the tibiofemoral joint pre and post-surgery. The main aims are as follows: -

3DMP - To develop a diagnostic digital tool for surgeons to predict Pre-op and Post-Op motion and measure contact and contact points post-surgery. This will be integrated into TOKA's existing HTO planning software.

Cardiff University - To develop pipelines that use the available imaging data (e.g CT) to measure contact pressure and locations and to correlate them to clinical measures and biomechanics that we can measure in our gait lab. Identifying and translating salient information for use in the TOKA's surgical planning software to enhance patient outcome.","The product, developed previously at Bath University, is being trialled in Italy and the UK across 5 surgical centres (PASHiOn). There have been severe delays due to the halting of elective surgery during COVID but the trail has now commenced, and recruitment has begun. The main impact of the work that has resulted from the OATech+ RFP study, to date, is the ability to quantify previously inaccessible, in-vivo dynamic, loaded arthrokinematics pre and post surgery.

The dynamic and bone models generated and the arthokinematic and gait biomechanics outputs will provide evidence to support the clinical and video vector evidence from the PASHiOn study and will also provide parameters for optimising the models developed for virtual surgical planning and training.","https://www.tokagroup.com/","6230bd64f33525.42942494","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=productintervention&outcomeId=6230bd64f33525.42942494&grantRef=EP%2FN027264%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N027264/1","0DCE5D8F-553F-4541-B6C0-4FBD8CCD7571","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","9C10D78F-6430-4CA7-9528-B96B0762A4C6","034115B1-EE0A-4A80-BF44-CB0631D1513A"

These patients consume 50-60% (1,2) of the healthcare costs of asthma and as such, there is much interest in developing novel treatments for this group.

The heterogeneity of inflammatory pathways underlying asthma are of great interest with development of biomarkers useful for phenotyping asthmatic patients and allowing more accurate assessment of their response to treatment. Traditionally, oral corticosteroids are used in eosinophilic, 'T2-high' asthmatic patients with good therapeutic effect, however, there are a group of T2-high patients who have refractory type-2 cytokine driven inflammation and airway eosinophilia despite oral corticosteroids. As such, there are several novel biological agents being engineered to block type 2 cytokine pathways including antagonists to IL5, IL13 and IL4.

Mepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody against IL5. Through a selective inhibition of eosinophilic inflammation, the agent reduces the number of eosinophils in sputum and blood, with important clinical outcomes such as a reduction of asthma exacerbations and a need for systemic glucocorticoids (3,4,5). The pre-licencing clinical trials have shown that selective inhibition of IL5 and presumptive removal of eosinophils reduces exacerbations by 50%, but while this is a significant reduction, patients with severe asthma continue to have severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid administration (3,4,5),.

Therefore, the point of interest is eliciting the inflammatory phenotype and physiological characteristics of the remaining 50% of exacerbations and ascertaining whether systemic corticosteroids have a role when the IL-5 pathway has been blocked by Mepolizumab.

Purpose/ Aim
This is an observational study designed to phenotype exacerbations or worsening asthma control when participants are established on Mepolizumab. Key exploratory outcomes will be fall in lung function, change in symptom score and number of participants progressing to rescue oral corticosteroids during a clinical deterioration whilst on Mepolizumab.

The hypothesis is as follows: In patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma, who have been established on mepolizumab:
- increased asthma symptoms (exacerbations) will have no evidence of airway eosinophilia and will be clinically mild events associated with small reductions in lung function which may not require rescue oral corticosteroids.

Outline plan of investigation
This will be an open observational multi-centre, cohort study in participants with severe asthma (Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Steps 4 and 5 classification of asthma severity)(6) who are initiated on Mepolizumab in line with the NICE/SMC Clinical Guidelines. 

The study is exploratory and will assess deteriorations in asthma control to characterise the clinical severity of each exacerbation and the airway and systemic inflammatory phenotype associated with these events. Clinical assessment and management of each exacerbation will be in line with standard clinical guidelines (SIGN 153, British Guideline on the Management of Asthma, September 2016)(7,8). 

The study design incorporates a proportion of participants already established on Mepolizumab as well as participants who will be commenced on Mepolizumab on entry to the study. A baseline assessment of medical history, clinical examination, lung function and sputum/blood/urine for analysis will be undertaken along with quality of life questionnaires. Those newly started on Mepolizumab, will be assessed in a similar manner 3 months into the study.

Subjects will be given an electronic peak flow recorder, symptoms diary and action plan for change in baseline symptoms. Participants will be asked to contact the clinic when they feel there has been a decline in asthma control and before they take rescue treatment, a clinic visit will be arranged. At this visit, all participants will have full medical assessment and clinical management based on detailed medical history, clinical findings and lung function measurement. Blood will be taken as part of this clinical assessment as outlined in the schedule of study procedures including biobanking of samples for whole blood gene expression, serum, plasma, sputum and urine. These samples will be stored for validation of additional biomarkers, aligned with the RASP-UK biomarker corticosteroid optimisation study.


Number in study:
This is a study will take place across 4 NHS sites within the UK, namely Belfast, Glasgow, Oxford and Leicester.

The study design incorporates a proportion of participants already established on Mepolizumab and also participants starting on Mepolizumab, allowing recruitment of up to 150 participants in a 6 - 9 month window (all sites have large numbers of patients on the waiting list for the drug). Assuming a conservative 0.7 exacerbations per patient per year on mepolizumab (ca 160 events in an 18 month period) and a minimum rate of attendance of 65% this is 102 observed episodes. The study will be terminated when 100 clinical assessments at exacerbation in total have been completed across all sites for participants on Mepolizumab prior to initiation of rescue treatment. The expected duration of study per participant is 24 months.
