These underpin legislation aimed at achieving this vision, specifically the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. In the UK this took the form of the report: &quot;Charting Progress 2: The State of UK Seas&quot;, and the on-going Evidence Groups. Alongside this, the Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP) and UKCP09 provide assessments of potential future conditions. NOC is the leading UK organisation for providing this evidence, advice, information and future projections for physical oceanography. Its scientists were lead / co-authors for CP2 &quot;Ocean Processes&quot; chapter, most MCCIP science reviews, and the UKCP09 (UK Climate Predictions) Marine Section. 
o The UK vision for &quot;clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas&quot; (Defra, 2002) is reinforced by international obligations, e.g. the Oslo-Paris Convention. Especially, the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008) lists 11 aspects of &quot;Good Environmental Status&quot; (GES) to be achieved by 2020, and monitored on a six-yearly cycle. Costs of neglecting such Directives can be severe but avoided through good scientific knowledge; NOC's role has been to provide this knowledge in appropriate and timely forms.
o In pursuit of the UK vision and more recently the implementation of MSFD, Defra leads the UK Marine Monitoring and Assessment Strategy (UKMMAS), a &quot;community&quot; of more than 40 member organisations. Through UKMMAS Defra sponsored &quot;Charting Progress 2: The State of UK Seas&quot; (CP2, 2010) a comprehensive report on the state of the UK seas. CP2 &quot;provides a considerably improved assessment of the productivity of our seas, and the extent to which human uses and natural pressures are affecting their quality - addressing the specific species, habitats and economic issues of the eight UK Marine regions. It helps to show whether current environmental protection measures are working, and aims to provide policy makers, planners and the public with a clear evaluation of our progress towards the vision&quot; (Defra introduction therein). CP2 forms the primary evidence base for the Defra 2012 UK Initial Assessment of the state of UK seas under MSFD; this Initial Assessment needed little other evidence than that in CP2 (2010). The CP2 experience has enabled the UK to take the lead across Europe in many aspects of MSFD refinement of GES, defining indicators and targets.
o Annual gross value added by UK marine economic activity is estimated as ?47bn, including ?37bn oil and gas extraction (CP2, 2010) MSFD poses a challenge to sustain this activity while achieving and maintaining GES. An aspect of this challenge is delivering science to distinguish human from climatic factors in change. The distinction helps to develop an effective Programme of Measures for GES, saving UK plc and Government money. An example is the successful defence of Infraction Proceedings under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. Science refutation of this alleged eutrophication in nearshore UK waters (due to nitrate etc. in waste-water) avoided a cost to the UK water industry of ?6 bn(of ineffective measures).
o The UK Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP) brings together scientists, government, its agencies and NGOs to provide co-ordinated advice on climate change impacts around our coast and in our seas. The UK marine science strategy states that, &quot;Ocean information will be essential and integral to the development and continual improvement of climate information. In this context, MCCIP, in which many organisations contribute to regular assessments of current and future changes, is an example of good practice that the Strategy will seek to support and encourage&quot;. Beneficiaries include all those handling marine impacts of climate change. These include Defra and &quot;UK plc&quot;: UK business performance vis ? vis environmental sustainability and environmental operating conditions. 
o UKCP09 is the fifth generation of climate change information for the UK, reflecting significant advances in climate science and computer modelling. For the first time, marine and coastal projections for NW European Seas are included (for sea level rise, storm surge, sea surface and sub-surface temperature, salinity, currents, and waves), including freely available model data sets. MEECE5 and QUEST_FISH projects followed this up by exploring climate and direct anthropogenic effects on planktonic ecosystems and fish/fisheries. 
o The potential relevance of climate change impacts on fish production to food security are immense, particularly when considered on a global scale, as in QUEST-FISH: about 400 million people rely on fish for &gt;50% of their animal protein. 
o UKCP09 and MEECE provide a future look at potential changes to GES under MSFD, specifically relevant to the following GES Descriptors: 1, Biological diversity; 3, Population of commercial fish / shell fish; 4, Elements of marine food webs; 5, Eutrophication; 6, Sea floor integrity; 7, Alteration of hydrographical conditions.","http://chartingprogress.defra.gov.uk/","5460f945048c13.41532266","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5460f945048c13.41532266&grantRef=noc010012","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=noc010012","6D6B1518-6B3A-4ABD-B79A-C4E92D7BE4CB","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","F99A9B4B-CB30-424B-8584-46AB9B1CD166"

The intention is to produce a set of priority topics that will be synthesised into an overarching document for wide dissemination. Priority areas will take account of the Sustainable Development Goals, and of UK research strengths in science and the application of science to society.
Workshop format: 4 sessions over 11 days. The sessions will be recorded to allow people who have missed a session to catch up.&quot;
 
ATTENDEES: ~60 attendees, including:
- Marine scientists (mostly UK, some international)
- Representatives from and advisors to UK Government: DEFRA, JNCC, FCDO, CEFAS
- UNESCO representatives from the International Oceanographic Commission
- EU Marine Board
- NGOs
 
SUMMARY: The tag line for the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) is &quot;the science we need for the ocean we want&quot;. In this context the series of four workshops identified opportunities for the UK marine science community to mobilise and deliver transformative marine research to deliver sustainable development outcomes. Four 'priority' areas were identified for the UK's potential contribution to the UN Ocean Decade, all building on existing UK strengths and opportunities. One of these is 'Coral Coasts' (The case for this, including the projected Outputs and Outcomes of such a decade-long initiative, is summarised below).
 
WORKSHOP OUTPUTS: The specific output from this Workshop will be:
- A short high-level overview of the key outcomes of the workshop, including recommendations.
- A series of annexes including a synthesis of the workshop discussion, the workshop agenda and the attendees list.
These will be published imminently (due end Feb 2021)
 
WORKSHOP OUTCOMES: These recommendations are likely to lead to mobilisation of the UK and international scientific community and national and international funding around the priority themes over the next decade. This will lead to improved marine ecosystems and increased resilience, health, and livelihoods of resource-dependent coastal communities globally. 
 
THE CASE FOR &quot;CORAL COASTS&quot; AS UK PRIORITY ARE FOR THE UN OCEAN DECADE:
a) THE CONTEXT 
 
CORAL REEFS: 
• &lt;0.1% of the ocean area, but home to ~25% of known marine species.
• Ecosystem Services ~US$350billion - US$10trillion/annum.
• 30-50% of coral reefs lost or severely degraded over last few decades due to overexploitation, pollution and climate change
MANGROVES:
• Biodiversity and coastal protection worth up to US$24trillion/annum.
• 30-50% mangrove cover lost over the past century.
• mangrove loss accounts for ~10% of global deforestation CO2 emissions.
PEOPLE:
• Over 100 million small scale fishers in the Global South depend on these tropical coral coast resources.
• They land ~50% of global catch, feeding about 1 billion people worldwide.
• Some of the poorest and most climate-vulnerable communities.
CONSEQUENCES: an interlinked ecological and humanitarian crisis
 
b) UK STRENGTHS AND NATURAL ADVANTAGES
- SCIENCE: Excellent science across spectrum of coral reef and mangrove research (authorship in 10-15% of all publications over past decade)
- REACH: globally distributed (Commonwealth; Overseas Territories, other historical ties); exceptional NGO sector; trusted partnerships; alignment to national initiatives.
- TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH: pioneers in bridging social and natural sciences for sustainable development outcomes: e.g., ESPA, GCRF 
 
c) The Concept: &quot;Climate-proofing food security and livelihoods on tropical coral coasts&quot;
Essential Elements:
- Science solutions: Includes integration of traditional knowledge and 'citizen science'.
- Co-creation: Co-create from the outset; support local capacity and ownership of context-appropriate solutions. 
- Democratising data: ensure data and knowledge are in the hands of those who most need it, from community fishers to national governments.
Measures of Success:
- Outputs: openly accessible data, platforms and publications.
- Outcomes: (i.e., what makes it 'transformative'). These can be delivered within the Decade:
o Restored ecosystems (increased biodiversity, biomass and sustainable fish yield).
o Improved human health and nutrition
o Reduced poverty and inequality
o Gender equity
o Increased resilience to externally driven change and shocks (climate; COVID)
o Climate mitigation",,"6048a69721f146.59079744","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=6048a69721f146.59079744&grantRef=NE%2FL013371%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L013371/1","E18E9535-B8E1-4400-9776-C85A2D6374F9","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4FC881BE-799E-459C-A287-2A68170426DA","AD04302A-28C2-4AEF-AFC4-D4A5839455A8"

The National Oceanography Centre (NOC) is providing impartial, independent, world-leading expertise in developing the international scientific consensus that informs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) series of Assessment Reports3. NOC provides authoritative oceanographic scientific evidence to underpin the assessments, necessary as climate change has enormous economic and societal implications. NOC research is a significant contributor to the international delivery of evidence on ocean circulation, global temperature, sea level and climate.
In response to research evidence presented by the IPCC the UK parliament passed the world's first long-term legally binding framework to tackle the dangers of climate change (The Climate Change Act 20086). The act requires Government to set carbon budgets, which are limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the UK for consecutive five-year periods. In addition to IPCC assessments, NOC data and expertise, including sea-level from PSMSL (Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level), inform studies of impacts of climate change on both national and international levels [e.g. UK Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP), UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP), UK Foresight Flood and Coastal Defence Review, Charting Progress and Charting Progress 2.",,"545cb0d635b274.06828988","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=545cb0d635b274.06828988&grantRef=noc010010","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=noc010010","BFCBA2D3-836A-4D2F-A617-CBAF15B0FA04","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","F4BB454D-E8B1-48B1-9844-FE58BF816C7C"

SUSTAINABLE STYLIST SURVEY. SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF FEEDBACK FROM THE VIRTUAL SALON 1.2.2017

Sample: 324 respondents, mostly trainees (n = 177) and trainers (n = 70) with a mix of others (salon owners, hairdressers, unspecified). 

Training: Most of these had little (n= 158) or no (n= 74) training in sustainability of hair-care. 64 had attended a training event at college and 11 had attended one of our eco-workshops 

ECOTIPS
 What eco-tips had most useful information/advice. Which aspects were most inspirational? (we added up text responses and summarised in table below)
Disposable Towels 24 comments Laundering towels as this is a big problem within the college. Broken machines, funding for washing powder, labour to maintain towels etc. Interesting that disposable towels were a much cheaper option. This is something I will pass on to the college management.

Water saving e.g. technologies etc. 23 comments The different shower head and cleansing conditioner are useful things to know.
Wash hair less 18 comments I learned to not wash your hair every day and to wash it every other day. Also, I learned to wash your hair with one shampoo and not two.

All Useful 18 comments
One wash not two 17 comments I found the washing tips most useful to inform clients. The fact they may not need a second shampoo or that they may not need to use conditioner all the time, and that leave in conditioner is just as good.
Energy Saving 15 comments advice on LED Lightbulbs
Money 14 comments
Dry Shampoo 13 comments 
Palm Oil 12 comments
Leave-in conditioner 12 comments Not washing your hair as much and using dry shampoos and leave in conditioners
Organic/eco-friendly products 10 comments
Less Shampoo 9 comments 
Tepid Water 7 comments 
Carbon Footprint 7 comments 
Star Rated Electricals 5 comments 
Advice to clients 2 comments I found that the video of 8 minutes was very helpful and it makes me understand about the environment more. The ones about washing the hair and how to save water and to reduce the energy bills are very helpful and I will put these tips to use when I am in my house. I will also try to use the tips on dry shampoo and the leave in conditioner because I colour my hair very frequently and I will find these helpful for me

Tip Frequency Typical quote
No 109 comments No there weren't any eco tips that I disagreed on and wouldn't use.

Disposable Towels 14 comments disposable towels - clients do not like them

One wash not two 5 comments Shampooing is an enjoyable, relaxing experience and is part of the service. I would worry that my clients would feel I am rushing them through the service. I would certainly offer them a massage as an alternative if it is suitable for the client's hair type. Often it is evident that two shampoos are not required and in this case I would be prepared to only offer one.

Dry Shampoo 5 comments Leave- in conditioner / dry shampoo not suitable for all hair types and can themselves cause more hair problems if used too often or incorrectly

Leave-in conditioner 4 Not sure on the use of only leave in conditioners as I have always understood that combing through conditioner close down the cuticle to help make it shiny.

Colouring tips 2 
Cleansing Conditioner 2 
Wash hair less 1 
Advice to clients 1 
Reducing waste 1

 The section on wasted left over colouring products. Stating the correct method of disposal. But it clearly states the benefits.

Washing up less frequently 1 
Curling without heat 1 
Hair Chalk 1 
Palm Oil 1

 I would say that it is best to advise against the use of palm oil completely, as the plantations are just ones in areas where the deforestation has already occurred, and so are preventing the deforestation of that area

* Birmingham City University: http://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=14222
* University of Leeds: http://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=6352

• Since REF2014 was published, the IUCN UK National Committee has implemented the Peatland Code (launched November 2015), a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) scheme supported by Defra and the devolved administrations, which sets out best practice requirements for peatland restoration projects wishing to attract private funding on the basis of their ecosystem service benefit (IUCN UK Peatland Programme, In Draft).

• To date, two projects have registered with the Peatland Code, namely Langholm Moor and North Sanquhar Moor in Scotland. Each is currently working towards validation to provide assurance that implementation of their restoration plan will result in the proposed greenhouse gas emission reductions.

• Further funding is being leveraged to apply the Peatland Code in other areas of the UK, including €7M EU LIFE funding to trial the Code in the North Pennines and Yorkshire, using Kelda Group (parent company of Yorkshire Water) as the corporate carbon benefactor (subject to successful bid).

• The Peatland Code facilitates a new avenue of funding for peatland restoration. In doing so it impacts biodiversity in the following ways:

o Conserves and reverses the decline of Sphagnum-dominated bog habitat - a priority habitat under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (blanket bogs and lowland raised bogs);

o Encourages the re-establishment of Sphagnum growth - the main peat-forming species in UK peatlands, contributing to carbon sequestration and storage. There are 34 UK species of Sphagnum bog moss associated with raised bog and blanket mire landscapes, several of which are uncommon or rare e.g. S. austinii (Bain, et al., 2011);

o Provides habitat for highly specialised species, that are often rare, threatened and/or declining e.g. bog hoverfly (Eristalis cryptarum), golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria), red-throated diver (Gavia stellata) and greenshank (Tringa nebularia) - peatlands including the Flow Country in Scotland, hold the highest breeding density of greenshank in Europe (Bain, et al., 2011). For birds, peatland habitat provides important breeding and feeding grounds (see information on craneflies below) and stop-over sites (Minayeva, et al., 2016);

o Increases ecosystem resilience to climate change - peatland species are highly adapted to waterlogged and nutrient-poor conditions and are therefore sensitive to environmental change and habitat loss caused by factors including development, atmospheric deposition and climate change (Bain, et al., 2011); 

o Supports species from other habitats: once restored, peatlands in their semi-natural state can provide temporary refuges for species at the edge of their ranges, particularly when displaced by human activity or environmental change (Minayeva, et al., 2016);

o Establishes connectivity within a landscape, strengthening ecological networks (again linking to ecosystem resilience to climate change);

o Maintains (or restores) unique bog microtopography, which includes small 'bog zones' (10 - 20 cm) characterised by a wide variety of different species including plants, birds, invertebrates and mammals (Lindsay, 2010) (Lindsay, et al., 2014);

o Recovers the microbial communities of fungi, bacteria and algae that are associated with microhabitats around peatland plants and within the surface layers of peat soil (Andersen, et al., 2010);

o Prevents establishment of (or restoration intervention removes) competing non-peat forming species that are better adapted to drier conditions that can often cause further degradation, therefore safeguarding the habitat;

o Ditch blocking, a restoration method used to rewet peatlands (and supported by the Peatland Code), promotes species associated with wetter and more pristine conditions, suggesting that it benefits wider ecological function (Bellamy, et al., 2012).","http://www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/peatland-code/","55ddd96303a6b5.25300399","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=55ddd96303a6b5.25300399&grantRef=ES%2FH037144%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/H037144/1","7D7C7852-8169-4E24-85FB-EC80AE6BBD60","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","F7E13617-2678-475B-99E4-31479C92038D","1FACFE33-87E8-437F-83CE-C59293BDDFE3"

In September 2016 Environment Ministers from OECD and selected non-member countries met at OECD Headquarters under the chairmanship of New Zealand, with Chile and Slovenia as Vice-Chairs. The meeting took place after two major international events in 2015, the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. These international events were seen as likely to significantly shape the national and international environmental policy landscape for many years into the future. Ministers were provided with the opportunity to reflect on these developments and discuss how policies could help their countries to meet their commitments. The meeting addressed a range of issues in plenary sessions and in a number of breakout groups. The issues of climate change and circular economy were discussed in plenary at the start and end of the meeting, with breakout sessions on air pollution from transport, mainstreaming biodiversity across sectors, effective management of marine protected areas, nitrogen, financing investment in water security, and urban water pollution. Professor Penny Johnes was invited to attend the meeting to provide the briefing on Nitrogen.

BGS Co-Chairs one of the four NHP themes, the Hazard-Impact Model (HIM), and leads the work package focussing on landslides within the HIM. The HIM work package builds on partners' existing natural hazard science, expertise and services to deliver fully coordinated impact-based natural hazard advice to Category 1 and 2 responders. The HIM provides the responder community with more targeted information about the likely impact of natural hazard events on society (e.g. people, towns, and infrastructure) which is then used to assist in civil contingency planning and response efforts. The HIM has initially focused on hazards such as surface water flooding, wind and landslides, against information on population and other receptors held by the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL). Impacts of this work include:

• Provision of a consistent source of advice to government (e.g. The Cabinet Office's Scientific Advice Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and Board Room (COBR)) on the likely impacts of natural hazards across the UK.
• Cross agency collaboration enabling better quantification of the impacts of multiple natural hazards on society and the environment
• Development of strong scientific and technical collaboration with NHP partners.

- Ordinance 10.141/20: Sustainable Food Production Program, in the area of protection and promotion of food production. Its objective is the implementation of policies for the promotion of sustainable primary food production, in coordination with the industries of its value chain, in its productive, social and environmental dimensions.

- Ordinance 10.142/20: Program for the Promotion of Agrarian Parks, as a proposal for the management and protection of the territory where horticultural, agricultural and forestry activities coexist, prioritizing the production of healthy food and environmental protection.
(link: 

These ordinances improve environmental sustainability by protecting public land from speculative development; support communities's access to employment and to healthy food, by supporting access to land, entrepreneurial development, food transformation and access to markets, with effective solution to the problems of vulnerable communities. They also improve regulatory environment by shielding local population from agro-toxic pollution and promoting agroecological production outselling in the region.

In the future, expanding ocean-based sectors such 3as offshore renewable energies and marine biotechnologies will, while boosting job creation, energy supply, food security,and infrastructure, exert further stress on China's coastal seas. Therefore, a healthy ocean environment in China is a prerequisite for drawing on these direct and indirect economic opportunities that the ocean provides. In exploring and developing ongoing and potential future ocean-based industries, issues such as the environment and sustainability, use and development of new technologies, and social sustainability and gender aspects are key factors to be considered. The ocean offers great potential for China's economic and social development. However, feeding more than 9 billion people by 2050 while protecting biodiversity and the natural systems on which life depends is one of the greatest planetary challenges we face today. With dedicated efforts to ensure the further development of current and emerging industries in a sustainable manner, the ocean's potential can continue into the future.","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/124107/SPS-1-3-Global-Ocean-Governance-and-Ecological-Civilization-1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","603d02429c6445.82432433","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=603d02429c6445.82432433&grantRef=EP%2FR007519%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/R007519/1","F946523E-6607-428A-BAA9-4753ED6B5354","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","1CCBB638-FC43-48D9-9CAA-8EFCB8944393"

"NERC","noc010012","Intramural","Policy Influence","National Oceanography Centre",,"Bacon","Sheldon","","Cost avoidance: underpinning science base for coastal flood hazards","Citation in other policy documents",,"National","National Oceanography Centre (NOC ) science in the areas of sea level study, modelling of storm surges, waves and tsunamis, and the statistics of sea level extremes, underpins many aspects of government policy on coastal defence and the mitigation of risk. The science forms the basis of mature operational partnerships with the Environment Agency and with the Met Office. Through the Natural Hazards Partnership, NOC reviews coastal hazards for the National Risk Assessment (NRA) and advises the Government Chief Scientist on this issue. 
Coastal floods affecting the UK represent a threat to life as well as to economic and environmental assets. Around &pound;150 billion of assets and four million people are at risk from coastal flooding in the UK. Irrespective of any future change in storm climate, mean sea level rise will result in more instances of extreme sea levels. NOC plays a central role in the UK Coastal Monitoring and Forecasting (UKCMF) partnership, developing and maintaining the operational storm surge models as well as managing the network of UK tide gauges. The UKCMF system delivers improved coastal flood warning systems to the Environment Agency (EA). The coastal flood warning system for the UK was established as a direct result of the 1953 North Sea storm surge, which is still the worst natural disaster to affect the country in modern times. 
These flood warning systems safeguard lives, property and economic investment in the Thames area. Predictions for the November 2007 storm surge allowed agencies to operate the Thames Barrier and evacuate areas of Norfolk, avoiding fatalities and financial loss (307 lives were lost in the 1953 storm surge). Analysis by the Environment Agency shows that 500,000 homes are at risk of flooding in the Thames floodplain. The estimated value of property protected by the Thames Barrier is &pound;200 billion. If predictive modelling safeguards only 1% of these assets then it protects property to the value of &pound;2 billion per annum. Preserving Foreign Direct Investment to the London economy by alleviating concern of flood risk is also valued at &pound;2 billion per annum; furthermore, the direct economic costs of any flood event in London would cost &pound;94 million per flood day. 
The expected annual damages to properties in England at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea is estimated at more than &pound;1 billion. Over 25,400 miles of flood defences help reduce the risk by a factor of four, and in 2008-2009 the budget for flood defences in England was &pound;427 million. Coastal protection is designed using statistical methods, and the Environment Agency funded NOC scientists to work with university and engineering partners to provide the most reliable estimates of extreme water levels in a consistent way around the entire UK coastline. 
Through the Natural Hazards Partnership (NHP), NOC science relating to coastal hazards is translated into products and information in support of government. The NHP is a consortium of public bodies that provides information, research and analysis on natural hazards for the development of more effective policies, communications and services for civil contingencies, governments and the responder community across the UK.
Following the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, Horsburgh and Wilson provided the tsunami wave modelling expertise for two Defra-funded studies. These studies assessed the risk to the UK of tsunamis from several plausible sources. NOC scientists and engineers (Woodworth, Holgate, Foden) also contributed towards international efforts to deliver a more effective tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean, resulting in the saving of thousands of lives. Although the risk to the UK from tsunamis is extremely small, it is important to engage with international warning system initiatives: Horsburgh advises the Cabinet Office on how the UK should receive operational alerts from the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission's (IOC) North East Atlantic and Mediterranean Tsunami Warning System (NEAMTWS). 
More recently, the Sendai earthquake off Japan in March 2011, and the resulting disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, prompted a further review of risk to the UK's nuclear infrastructure from tsunamis. NOC were solicited to provide advice on tsunami risk to the UK to HM Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations.","http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/GEHO0609BQDS-E-E.pdf.","5460f80f2e21d7.55095555","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5460f80f2e21d7.55095555&grantRef=noc010012","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=noc010012","6D6B1518-6B3A-4ABD-B79A-C4E92D7BE4CB","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","F99A9B4B-CB30-424B-8584-46AB9B1CD166"

For species which directly depend on one another, a change in one species can have a severe impact on the other. A recent report by the European Environment Agency has revealed dramatic declines in some grassland butterfly populations in Europe since 1990. Based on research results of the BiodivERsA-funded CLIMIT project, conservation schemes could be improved to help halt the extinction of the threatened insects studied in the project. Specific conservation measures could help improve the status of these species by allowing them time to adapt to environmental changes,and to maintain or progress towards favourable conservation status. Such adaptive management measures can contribute significantly to reaching the targets of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 and to fulfil the obligations in the EU Habitats Directive. CLIMIT outcomes: Some highly-specialized insects, such as the Large Blue butterfly (Maculinea arion), are highly vulnerable to environmental changes The use of appropriate adaptive management measures, in particular integrating ecological knowledge and promoting habitat patches and heterogeneity have been demonstrated to be beneficial to insect conservation A spectacular increase in the Large Blue population in the United Kingdom was possible through specific conservation measures Adequate monitoring and management of Natura 2000 sites and integration of ecological knowledge into management practices are essential for species adaptation Creating and restoring grassland patches enhances insect conservation, as supported by the EU Biodiversity Strategy and recent policy on Green Infrastructure National Rural Development Programmes under the Common Agricultural Policy could better contribute to enhancing grassland conservation EU Member States should build on the advice given in the new European Commission Guidelines on Climate Change and Natura 2000 in their site management planning Target audience(s): Independent Research Organisation;Research Council/Institute;Public Research Organisation;Government Department","http://www.biodiversa.org/556/download","r-9694440411.1192621dc9c4","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=r-9694440411.1192621dc9c4&grantRef=NE%2FG001901%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/G001901/1","A6B0A3A9-B991-4ED6-8695-14BBEF601CCB","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4FC881BE-799E-459C-A287-2A68170426DA","C965AE07-6F4C-42E4-ABD3-94893ABDBD26"

Hosted by the World Bank, Washington DC, USA 27-29 November 2017","Participation in a national consultation",,"Multiple continents/international","Infrastructure-understood to include water supply and sanitation, flood protection, roads and transport, energy and telecommunications-has major implications for a variety of development outcomes, at the household level (health, education and social mobility), at the firm level (productivity, industrial development), and at the global level (climate change, energy, forests, biodiversity, pollution). Ensuring affordable and reliable access remains a major challenge in developing countries, but one that is further complicated by both a changing climate and changing climate policies. 
 
The balancing act across the three dimensions of sustainability - social, economic, and environmental - is increasingly central to the infrastructure challenge, even as the world appears to have made little progress in solving the infrastructure finance gap. These issues can and have been addressed from different scientific perspectives, including many different disciplines and methods. However, despite a clear move of the academic community towards interdisciplinary projects, researchers working on specific aspects of the infrastructure agenda are not systematically interacting with each other. 
 
The Fifth Green Growth Knowledge Platform (GGKP) Annual Conference will be hosted by the World Bank on the topic of sustainable infrastructure, to stimulate research on these issues and foster interdisciplinary dialogue where relevant. This conference aims at taking stock of recent advances and research challenges. To do so, we plan to gather the best researchers in the field, both from the academic world and from more policy-oriented backgrounds, to exchange ideas and insights in a two-day conference organized at the World Bank.

Outputs &amp; outcomes:
At the ITRC we've developed models to facilitate planning of infrastructure projects, using the 'system of systems' approach, allowing us to use our specialist researchers and models to look at ways of improving the performance of infrastructure systems on a local and national level in the UK, as well as overseas. This means investments in infrastructure can be properly costed, planned for long-term sustainability and resilience to natural hazards, and looked at from a systems perspective rather than on a project-by-project basis.
We're working closely with UNOPS as part of our mission to change people's perspectives around the environment, construction and infrastructure. Together with UNOPS, we have launched SustainABLE, a free online tool focusing on using technology and research for:
&middot; Sustainability for the communities to be served.
&middot; Saving the planet
&middot; Saving money.

We've been working with Scott Thacker, senior analyst at UNOPS and honorary research associate at the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, not just on the new tool but also on research which underpins its criticality. .../...

- Production of end products: recyclables (24.9% by mass of MSW), metals (2.7%), fibre (1.5%); levulinic acid (7.4%); recyclable water (14.7%), fertiliser (8.3%); and electricity (0.126 MWh/t MSW), respectively (Sadhukhan and Martinez-Hernandez, 2017).
- This clean technology and processing is needed for remedying environmental pollution, albeit at a higher capital investment. Process integration will be crucial for unlocking the value of organic waste via added value bio-based productions and a total site utility system design (Sadhukhan, 2018).
- The return of nutrients to agricultural land will be promoted by the proposed amendment to the EU Fertiliser Regulation. The research and industry sectors welcome proposals to increase the flexibility of the EU Fertiliser Regs. This will serve to level the field between the conventional and alternative fertiliser markets thus encouraging innovation in the production of fertilisers from waste. 
- Opportunities for integration of developing technologies into existing infrastructure can bring about complementary effects and perceived waste products can be utilised to benefit other parts of the system. Industrial symbiosis could promote sharing of technical expertise, opportunities to integrate complementary systems and symbiosis in terms of sharing of wastes from one industrial process that can become a valuable resource in another process. 
- Currently many AD plants and MSW treatment centres are reliant on public money in the form of incentives for energy production or for MSW treatment, gate fees paid by the local authority and feed-in-tariff for AD. The integration of Bioelectrochemical system (BES) into these existing technologies could lead to further valorisation of the waste streams in terms of high value chemicals and elements from MSW, and targeted fertiliser materials from AD. In order to promote economic independence of these technologies the full life cycle of the recovered materials compared to the fossil-fuel based equivalents they replace should be considered.- Techno-economic analysis, LCA and life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) have been extensively applied for RRfW within the METEORR project (Shemfe et al., 2018; Sadhukhan et al., 2018; Sadhukhan and Martinez-Hernandez, 2017; Sadhukhan et al., 2017; Ng et al., 2016; Sadhukhan et al. 2016a; Sadhukhan et al. 2016b)), to conclude the following (Sadhukhan, 2018).
o LCSA of BES clearly shows net savings of impacts in resources, climate change, ecosystem quality and human health, compared to equivalent fossil based services.
o LCSA should drive sustainable development of BES and RRfW and biorefinery systems and include the UN SDGs as far as possible to show its importance and relevance in developing economies.
o Pollutant emissions to the environment should be regulated to the most stringent level (Planetary boundaries).
o Policy incentives are needed for BES and RRfW and biorefinery systems, e.g. funding one third the initial investment without payment for next ten years can progress small to medium enterprises (SMEs) (Sadhukhan et al., 2018). 
o Innovation and resource efficiency and productivity are the key criteria for the eligibility for such funding.","http://www.theibest.org/Life%20Cycle%20Sustainability%20Assessment%20(LCSA)%20-%20end%20of%20project%20report.pdf","5aa662c6347ce3.42490389","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5aa662c6347ce3.42490389&grantRef=NE%2FL014246%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L014246/1","B45DB07A-A707-4005-A8ED-D1F564C28853","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","67B34D05-3A52-4A09-8FF9-F2398D60E246","989E82E7-7E33-4A80-99D4-57158703E3C1"

"NERC","noc010015","Intramural","Policy Influence","National Oceanography Centre",,"Bell","Paul","","Marine Renewable Energy Industry","Citation in other policy documents",,"National","NOC science has underpinned the assessments of both energy resource availabilities and significance of environmental impacts of marine renewable energy installations, enabling growth of the sector and ongoing cost savings for stakeholders. In particular, NOC's strength and reputation in tidal modelling and ocean observations have been of particular interest to an industry that, by definition, plans to extract energy from some of the most extreme marine environments in the world where accurate predictions and measurements of tides and waves are essential.
• Mapping the UK tidal energy resource for the DTI (now DECC) Atlas of UK Marine Renewable Energy Resources. Originally published in 2004, refined in 2008 to include vertical current profiles, and fronted by ABPmer, the freely available atlas provided an independent energy resource assessment based on best available tidal models developed at NOC. The atlas helped establish the location and extent of energy resources that enabled government, industry and investors to commit to developing areas of UK waters for energy exploitation and develop the technologies needed to achieve this. The resulting atlas has been online since 2008 as an interactive webGIS version freely available to all. Other downloadable outputs include pre-prepared atlas maps in PDF format, a technical report and resource data layers (ArcGIS and MapInfo formats). The atlas has been widely used by government, industry and third sector organisations, for example, in HM Government 's Marine Energy Action Plan (2010).
• Contribution to a feasibility study for a future tidal barrage across the Mersey Estuary. Following the 'Joule' (NWDA-funded) study which showed that tidal barrages in the Eastern Irish Sea could contribute 50% of the North West's present electricity needs, NOC contributed advice on tidal principles, modelled a range of operating options and compiled a &quot;Review of Existing Knowledge of Hydrodynamics and Water Levels in Liverpool Bay and the Mersey Estuary&quot; for Peel Holdings in Liverpool. Peel's study concluded in 2011 that a Mersey Barrage was technically feasible without significant detrimental effects to the environment and could generate sufficient electricity to power 200,000 average homes. However, it was unlikely to go ahead without long term financial vehicles to balance the high up-front construction costs with the anticipated long operating lifetime of 120years and security of supply benefits. Wider applicability to other potential tidal schemes has also been cited.
• Development of a globally applicable, robust algorithm for wave energy resource assessment. Skills were successfully migrated from NOC and University of Southampton into Pelamis Wave Power , adding increased levels of awareness of the use and importance of statistical techniques. The Knowledge Transfer Partnership project developed resources and software to assess the wave energy resource at potential sites for wave energy farms equipped with wave energy converters for any location in the world. Energy productivity can now be assessed at any location in the world, a unique selling proposition, providing a significant competitor advantage. Pelamis Wave Power is recognised as being the industry leader in developing wave energy technology, with the world's first grid connected wave energy converter and the world's first multiple machine wave installation.
• Assessing impact of offshore wind farm (OWF) monopiles on constructive/destructive interference patterns of waves - concluded no need for monitoring. This study resulted in direct cost savings for the industry by removing the requirement for the monitoring for the effects of wave diffraction/interference effects. The final report prepared by CEFAS advised: &quot;Defra's Marine Consents and Environment Unit (MCEU) are advised not to require developers of OWFs to monitor waves for diffraction/interference effects under a FEPA licence.&quot; Before and after installation studies by radar could be expected to cost upwards of &pound;100k per wind farm . Cumulative savings on the 17 currently operating wind farms10 would therefore be estimated at &pound;1.6M. A further 20 wind farms are at construction, consenting or planning stages, with potential cumulative savings of a further &pound;2M to the industry, and by implication to the UK as users of the resulting electricity. There are 40GW of further offshore wind capacity leased or at pre-planning stages which will have corresponding cost savings. The indirect benefits of reducing installation costs are far reaching, and likely to feed through to energy prices via reduced costs in servicing the project construction capital. 
Increased stakeholder-researcher collaboration in marine renewable energy (MRE) Sector. NOC hosts the NERC Marine Renewable Energy Knowledge Exchange Programme which is actively facilitating collaborations between NERC funded researchers across the UK and MRE industry, test centre and stakeholder groups. The small KE team have facilitated a range of workshops, meetings, conferences and demonstrations of NERC-funded science. They are taking advantage of existing focus points for the sector such as the European Marine Energy Centre Developers Forum and the National Renewable Energy Centre (Narec) to bring researchers together with industry to help solve sector issues such as impacts of underwater noise, cost effective monitoring, and population consequences of disturbance to marine mammals amongst others. The catalytic effect of these activities is enabling the sector to access the state of the art in all aspects of marine environmental science although it is too early to cite direct industry impacts.","http://www.renewables-atlas.info/","54610ba0a92242.53869892","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=54610ba0a92242.53869892&grantRef=noc010015","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=noc010015","2289572E-7480-448C-A765-E6DF8FFD81F4","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","EE08795A-8022-44FA-885F-3CFBCD11F74D"

Many boroughs have declared a climate emergency, and all will be making changes in their own local areas through climate action plans. They are also working together in our seven collaborative climate programmes to share best practices, join up activity, and grasp economies of scale.

From tackling carbon emissions from motor vehicles to building local green economies, and sourcing and creating sustainable energy, local government is an essential partner in delivering the transition to net-zero. Councils have a unique understanding of their local context and strong local relationships, allowing them to deliver this work effectively.
This is important work. We have already seen the growing impact of extreme weather events in London. From our annual polling, we know that Londoners across the city and in all demographic groups are motivated to tackle climate change and want to see action.

The purpose of this action plan is to set a pathway to achieve the ambition set out in London Councils' Joint Statement on Climate Change. The Low Carbon
Transport ambition is to halve road journeys made by petrol and diesel from 2019 to 2030 via combined measures that can restrict polluting journeys and
incentivise sustainable and active travel options.
The ambition provides the opportunity to deliver and quantify actions that help record performance of greenhouse gas emissions for individual boroughs'
Climate Emergency Action Plans and to promote strategies, schemes and projects to this end.
The action plan has been developed collaboratively by London boroughs, with support from London Councils, the London Technical Advisers Group
(LOTAG), Transport for London (TfL), the London Environment Directors' Network (LEDNet), the Greater London Authority (GLA), and other key
stakeholders.
The Low Carbon Transport Programme (LCTP) Steering Group, led jointly by Royal Borough of Kingston Council and Westminster City Council, has adopted
this plan, and progress will be reported back to London Councils' Transport and Environment Committee (TEC) on at least a six-monthly basis. This plan is designed to support all boroughs to achieve the headline ambition, whilst recognising that requirements and resourcing will vary from
borough to borough.","https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/our-key-themes/climate-change","62239a2a0d0712.87296074","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=62239a2a0d0712.87296074&grantRef=ES%2FW000563%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/W000563/1","CA8D5DCD-7441-44D0-9F2D-B9D6A289C7FA","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","BD856F04-3042-4F92-8D66-1B101801FEB8","63331620-811D-4AB8-9900-2590DC807F20"

PML also presenting science evidence and KE information at two exhibition stands (led by PML, and jointly funded by the German BIOACID programme, the Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre and the University of Brest). Ocean-related issues were given a relatively high profile at COP22, including a high level UN Ocean Action Event which was, for the first time included within the UN sessions. PML was invited to speak at one of the session during this UN Ocean Action Day on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) session on Blue Economies and Building Resilience to Climate Change, and was an author of the Strategic Action Roadmap on Oceans and Climate launched during the day: https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/sites/default/files/publications/strategic_action_roadmap_on_oceans_and_climate_november_2016.pdf",,"58b86b2f1dd028.76362085","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=58b86b2f1dd028.76362085&grantRef=pml010009","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=pml010009","948A5562-6BE1-48FE-B392-64D39C010339","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","EEF9EA95-341D-48C2-8A68-B838D35497C8","7300F58C-5309-42D5-A146-F806C5FA7814"

Impacts that we have achieved are that by mapping, running Bee-steward simulations and providing bespoke reports and meetings with a variety of landowners in Cornwall by we have safeguarded 6839 ha of land. As part of this we have enhanced 392 ha of land by making suggestion that boost the biodiversity value of the land. As part of this we have helped to create 545.3 ha of land specifically for pollinators, so this is brand new interventions that were not there before and this includes 13.81 ha of wildflower meadow. This is either work underway or planned. 

Financial savings to cropgrowers

Additionally from the reports we have saved stakeholders money by changes in management through costs avoided with hedgerow management &pound;3380 pa and cover cropping &pound;29337 pa. We have also helped towards 2 Countryside Stewardship applications with these reports, providing financial returns for the next 5 years. Evidence for this is in the Impact store and tables of land modelled, reports we have created and Letters of Testimony.

Strengthening partnerships

The audit was vital in providing the background mapping used for the B-Lines targeting workshop, this information helped to make sure we could cover important areas for pollinators but also where there was a lot of work going on or planned with the stakeholders that we needed to consider. Of course difficult to compare if we hadn't have done it this way, by teaming up and taking a landscape scale strategic look at habitat creation opportunities across the county we should be able to do more, with less resources and combine the efforts of multiple stakeholders. Bringing key stakeholders together for the targeting helped pool resources and effort so then we can make a significant impact of the environment. Buglife will launch the Cornwall B-lines in August/September 2019 and then will record the areas of land dedicated to habitat creation, showing the legacy of this 007/008 project. Evidence is the B-Lines maps themselves that will be hosted on the Buglife Website www.buglife.org.uk.

While the reduction of avoidable organic waste remains a priority, a number of waste streams are likely to persist and could provide a significant feedstock for the UK bioeconomy. The greatest environmental, social and economic benefits of resource recovery from organic wastes are associated with the displacement of fossil fuel derived chemicals and materials, and the combined products of nutrients and energy from anaerobic digestion. Organic wastes offer multiple resources that can be exploited most efficiently by technologies working in synergy with each other. Investments into different options for using organic wastes are driven by government policy and resource demand, in addition to technology readiness.

"NERC","noc010012","Intramural","Policy Influence","National Oceanography Centre",,"Bacon","Sheldon","","The Marine Renewable Energy Industry","Citation in other policy documents",,"Multiple continents/international","NOC science has underpinned the assessments of both energy resource availabilities and significance of environmental impacts of marine renewable energy installations, enabling growth of the sector and ongoing cost savings for stakeholders. In particular, NOC's strength and reputation in tidal modelling and ocean observations have been of particular interest to an industry that, by definition, plans to extract energy from some of the most extreme marine environments in the world where accurate predictions and measurements of tides and waves are essential.
• Mapping the UK tidal energy resource for the DTI (now DECC) Atlas of UK Marine Renewable Energy Resources. Originally published in 2004, refined in 2008 to include vertical current profiles, and fronted by ABPmer, the freely available atlas provided an independent energy resource assessment based on best available tidal models developed at NOC. The atlas helped establish the location and extent of energy resources that enabled government, industry and investors to commit to developing areas of UK waters for energy exploitation and develop the technologies needed to achieve this. The resulting atlas has been online since 2008 as an interactive webGIS version freely available to all. Other downloadable outputs include pre-prepared atlas maps in PDF format, a technical report and resource data layers (ArcGIS and MapInfo formats). The atlas has been widely used by government, industry and third sector organisations, for example, in HM Government 's Marine Energy Action Plan (2010).
• Contribution to a feasibility study for a future tidal barrage across the Mersey Estuary. Following the 'Joule' (NWDA-funded) study which showed that tidal barrages in the Eastern Irish Sea could contribute 50% of the North West's present electricity needs, NOC contributed advice on tidal principles, modelled a range of operating options and compiled a &quot;Review of Existing Knowledge of Hydrodynamics and Water Levels in Liverpool Bay and the Mersey Estuary&quot; for Peel Holdings in Liverpool. Peel's study concluded in 2011 that a Mersey Barrage was technically feasible without significant detrimental effects to the environment and could generate sufficient electricity to power 200,000 average homes. However, it was unlikely to go ahead without long term financial vehicles to balance the high up-front construction costs with the anticipated long operating lifetime of 120 years and security of supply benefits. Wider applicability to other potential tidal schemes has also been cited.
• Development of a globally applicable, robust algorithm for wave energy resource assessment. Skills were successfully migrated from NOC and University of Southampton into a Wave Power company, adding increased levels of awareness of the use and importance of statistical techniques. The Knowledge Transfer Partnership project developed resources and software to assess the wave energy resource at potential sites for wave energy farms equipped with wave energy converters for any location in the world. Energy productivity can now be assessed at any location in the world, a unique selling proposition, providing a significant competitor advantage. 
• Assessing impact of offshore wind farm (OWF) monopiles on constructive/destructive interference patterns of waves - concluded no need for monitoring. This study resulted in direct cost savings for the industry by removing the requirement for the monitoring for the effects of wave diffraction/interference effects. The final report prepared by CEFAS advised: &quot;Defra's Marine Consents and Environment Unit (MCEU) are advised not to require developers of OWFs to monitor waves for diffraction/interference effects under a FEPA licence.&quot; Before and after installation studies by radar could be expected to cost upwards of &pound;100k per wind farm (NOC estimate of radar deployment cost, the figure of &pound;50k per deployment also agreed as a reasonable figure by Dr Jon Rees, CEFAS). Cumulative savings on the 17 currently operating wind farms would therefore be estimated at &pound;1.6M. A further 20 wind farms are at construction, consenting or planning stages, with potential cumulative savings of a further &pound;2M to the industry, and by implication to the UK as users of the resulting electricity. There are 40GW of further offshore wind capacity leased or at pre-planning stages, which will have corresponding cost savings. The indirect benefits of reducing installation costs are far reaching, and likely to feed through to energy prices via reduced costs in servicing the project construction capital. 
Increased stakeholder-researcher collaboration in marine renewable energy (MRE) Sector. NOC hosts the NERC Marine Renewable Energy Knowledge Exchange Programme which is actively facilitating collaborations between NERC funded researchers across the UK and MRE industry, test centre and stakeholder groups. The small KE team have facilitated a range of workshops, meetings, conferences and demonstrations of NERC-funded science. They are taking advantage of existing focus points for the sector such as the European Marine Energy Centre Developers Forum and the National Renewable Energy Centre (NAREC) to bring researchers together with industry to help solve sector issues such as impacts of underwater noise, cost effective monitoring, and population consequences of disturbance to marine mammals amongst others. The catalytic effect of these activities is enabling the sector to access the state of the art in all aspects of marine environmental science although it is too early to cite direct industry impacts.","http://www.renewables-atlas.info/","5460fdb8a034a6.61276769","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5460fdb8a034a6.61276769&grantRef=noc010012","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=noc010012","6D6B1518-6B3A-4ABD-B79A-C4E92D7BE4CB","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","F99A9B4B-CB30-424B-8584-46AB9B1CD166"

CT organised the EU Oceans Day side event, the science panel for UN Oceans Action Day and the UN side event held in the WWF pavilion and each had high level science and policy speakers. The side event she organised in the GB pavilion showcased UK marine science. She also facilitated and mentored young scientists from PML, POGO and BIOACID to engage the delegates at the exhibition stand and one (AQ) to have a speaking role in one side event.

a) Initiated and facilitated a UK (Defra) led side event on Ocean acidification: what can we do about it? I co-organised this with UN Convention on Biological Diversity for Defra, wrote the application, selected and invited speakers (3 from UKOA), and organised logistics for presentations. UK was therefore able to play a leading role at the Ocean Conference.
b) Invited panel speaker Ocean Acidification: Status, risks and options in the official UN Partnership Dialogue 3 (PD3) and panel on SDG14.3 on ocean acidification and co-authored its report to the UN General Assembly.

It provides an opportunity for participants to reflect on the factors influencing social acceptance of aquaculture operations and farmed seafood and to discuss potential approaches to develop socially acceptable aquaculture businesses and products.","https://www.eitfood.eu/projects/inspire","6231b95a70df28.32947143","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=6231b95a70df28.32947143&grantRef=BB%2FS014128%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/S014128/1","B509983A-5E6C-45A6-BF15-C62468D260F0","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","1ED25A21-FD91-4EC2-A06F-724F9F2CDC3D","0E1BF83A-4616-48E8-B668-7B9B111104E9"

Our work jointly with ENERGY J.H. S.A. de C.V. to develop Jatropha biorefinery systems for Mexico demonstrates the following.
Driven by the need to develop a wide variety of products with low environmental impact, biorefineries need to emerge as highly integrated facilities. This becomes effective when overall mass and energy integration through a centralised utility system design is undertaken. An approach combining process integration, energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission analyses is shown in this paper for Jatropha biorefinery design, primarily producing biodiesel using oil-based heterogeneously catalysed transesterification or green diesel using hydrotreatment. These processes are coupled with gasification of husk to produce syngas. Syngas is converted into end products, heat, power and methanol in the biodiesel case or hydrogen in the green diesel case. Anaerobic digestion of Jatropha by-products such as fruit shell, cake and/or glycerol has been considered to produce biogas for power generation. Combustion of fruit shell and cake is considered to provide heat. Heat recovery within biodiesel or green diesel production and the design of the utility (heat and power) system are also shown. The biorefinery systems wherein cake supplies heat for oil extraction and seed drying while fruit shells and glycerol provide power generation via anaerobic digestion into biogas achieve energy efficiency of 53 % in the biodiesel system and 57 % in the green diesel system. These values are based on high heating values (HHV) of Jatropha feedstocks, HHV of the corresponding products and excess power generated. Results showed that both systems exhibit an energy yield per unit of land of 83 GJ per ha. The global warming potential from GHG emissions of the net energy produced (i.e. after covering energy requirements by the biorefinery systems) was 29 g CO2-eq per MJ, before accounting credits from displacement of fossil-based energy by bioenergy exported from the biorefineries. Using a systematic integration approach for utilisation of whole Jatropha fruit, it is shown that global warming potential and fossil primary energy use can be reduced significantly if the integrated process schemes combined with optimised cultivation and process parameters are adopted in Jatropha-based biorefineries. We worked with ENERGY to take actions together with the Government, governmental organizations, universities, research centres and other companies.",,"5462153401efb2.24117839","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5462153401efb2.24117839&grantRef=EP%2FF063563%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/F063563/2","C1CB6E4E-F932-4DEA-9A5B-068186B9C301","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","67B34D05-3A52-4A09-8FF9-F2398D60E246","989E82E7-7E33-4A80-99D4-57158703E3C1"

Projects are wide ranging and include a mixture of disciplines, methodologies and tools from participatory mapping and community-led workshops to using virtual reality as a research tool to support urban planning. For example, one team in Bangladesh are using GIS-based analysis of remote sensing data to understand the rate of land and water body change caused by rapid urbanisation. Another team in Colombia are facilitating political and economic inclusion for informal workers through participatory policy engagement activities.

Many projects are led by early-career researchers which means that the skills, knowledge and experience they are developing will help strengthen and sustain research capacity within their local context.","http://www.centreforsustainablecities.ac.uk/","604a2967ab8017.02067590","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=604a2967ab8017.02067590&grantRef=ES%2FP011055%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/P011055/1","51E882C7-48BA-46BD-A440-E868BA1732C8","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","F3818F49-F230-48DC-B571-982D23B6266A"

The approach brought concrete results: the latest draft of the negotiating text was updated to recognise that the treaty must protect the many millions of people who depend on the high seas.","https://www.un.org/bbnj/sites/www.un.org.bbnj/files/draft_text_a.conf_.232.2019.6_advanced_unedited_version_corr.pdf","5e6780106389e4.60807887","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5e6780106389e4.60807887&grantRef=NE%2FL008750%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L008750/1","3793BD7F-091A-45D4-9111-57CCEC4F5539","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","813F6E5A-7C55-44B1-BC26-C77FF12DBD2C"

24/10/2018:Foreward to Conference: DR. MARLENE KANGA, AM FTSE Hon.FIEAust Hon.FIChemE, PRESIDENT, World Federation of Engineering Organisations
The World Federation of Engineering Organisations (WFEO) is proud to be leading the celebration of engineering as part of the bicentenary of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a national member of the Federation representing the UK, and to also celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of WFEO.
Their Triennial Statement states, in part: The SDGs were developed to address these challenges. They set out a 'bold and transformative plan of action which could shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path, leaving no one behind.' Using the SDGs as our framework, and the GEC as our launchpad, we intend to bring about transformative change in the way that infrastructure is designed, built and maintained.

ITRC/UNOPS presentations:
'Supporting evidence-based infrastructure development worldwide. Overview of Evidence Based Infrastructure (EBI)'. Nick O'Regan, Director of infrastructure and project management, UNOPS
'Introduction to tools'. Jim Hall, Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford
'Highlighting specifically technical developments (tools) within EBI and case-study applications: NISMOD-Int, Curacao and CAT-I'. Scott Thacker, UNOPS &amp; ITRC; Steven Crosskey, UNOPS

Scott Thacker, United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) 'Global Opportunities for Infrastructure Intelligence' slide presentation
Presentation covered many aspects including:
Opportunity - To identify adaptable pathways to sustainable development - Large quantities of infrastructure still to be built [estimated $57 trillion 2013 - 2030]
Risk - Long-term lock-in to unstainable technologies and practices - Inaction
Solution - Evidence and intelligence required to harness this opportunity and avoid the risk. To underpin policy and business cases and provide confidence to investors
Conclusions -Infrastructure is central for achieving sustainable development
The opportunity is reliant on evidence and intelligence
New datasets, methodologies and case studies are emerging
Still lots to be done to satisfy the global need
With Data and Analytics Facility National Infrastructure (DAFNI), the UK can be at the forefront of realising this global future. 

INFRASTRUCTURE LAYS FOUNDATIONS FOR SDG SUCCESS
New Oxford University-UNOPS report stresses infrastructure as key to unlocking Sustainable Development Goals.
A new report published today by the University of Oxford-led Infrastructure Transition Research Consortium (ITRC) and UNOPS, has found that efficient infrastructure policy and disciplined investment decisions are vital for attaining the SDGs.
The report, Infrastructure: Underpinning Sustainable Development, is the result of extensive research into the influence that both 'networked infrastructure' (water, waste, energy, digital communications and transport infrastructure) and 'non-networked infrastructure' (buildings and facilities) have on all 17 SDGs. It highlights the need to understand infrastructure as an integrated system of systems - the interdependencies across sectors requires us to break down the 'silo mentality' in infrastructure development.
Focusing on real-life projects implemented by UNOPS around the world, the report finds that infrastructure projects can have multiple effects across several SDGs and their targets. It found that networked infrastructure influences 72 percent of SDG targets, while non-networked infrastructure influences 81 percent of targets - reinforcing the pivotal role that infrastructure will play towards attaining the SDGs.
Introducing the report, UNOPS Executive Director Grete Faremo said: &quot;Infrastructure, in particular, underpins all of the SDGs. It plays a critical role in society because it can influence development far into the future - both positively and negatively. This is why it is vital to understand the influence that infrastructure systems have on the SDGs.
&quot;We are proud to present this report together with Oxford/ITRC, and to reaffirm our commitment to helping people build better lives and countries achieve peace and sustainable development.&quot;
The launch of the report coincides with the 2018 Global Engineering Conference, hosted by the Institution of Civil Engineers in London, starting today. 
UNOPS Director of Infrastructure and Project Management, Mr Nick O'Regan, will present the report during a keynote speech on Wednesday 24 October 2018. He will explore how rapid population growth, urbanization, climate change and challenges associated with development funding impact on achieving the SDGs. 
&quot;Our children and the children of those we serve have great expectations of their future, it is on all of us to create an environment that is resilient, sustainable and equitable - and the built environment can be an enabler or an obstacle to this,&quot; said Mr O'Regan. 
&quot;Together with our partners the ITRC, we have focused on the SDGs as a common framework to work towards an understanding of how we can contribute to sustainable development. This will help governments, and their development partners make better-informed decisions within this uncertainty,&quot; he said. 
Professor of Climate and Environmental Risk, University of Oxford, Professor Jim W Hall FREng added: &quot;Though our research started from a sustainability perspective, in particular the central role that infrastructure has in climate change mitigation and adaptation, our work has attracted growing attention from finance ministries and infrastructure units that tend to be focused on the role of infrastructure in economic growth and productivity.&quot;
&quot;In that sense, infrastructure can be a 'Trojan horse' that brings sustainability considerations within the purview of the economic imperatives of most governments.
&quot;The collaboration between ITRC and UNOPS has been a very productive one, with UNOPS bringing us new challenges from very diverse contexts around the world and opportunities for our work to have an impact on the ground, which is what motivates my team. This report provides a next important step in that journey.&quot;

- Added further general concepts to overview figures on circular economy
- Added the RRfW vision that not every circular supply chain is a good one, but that we need a CE within environmental and social boundaries. They already mentioned planetary boundaries in the draft, and I clarified this text and added that society and economy are dependent on environment as well as adding a sense of urgency (some other comments indicated CE was perceived sort of a luxury, i.e. more optional than it is rather than perceived as necessary)
- Added comments on levels of business model innovation. They did speak about value creation and at various points in the draft included environmental and social aspects, however, when it came to the value optimisation focus was back to purely economics. Hence I added feedback on including environmental and social values.

These waters do not exist in isolation: marine ecosystems are interconnected by ocean currents and the movement of migratory species. What happens in ABNJ can therefore cause impacts in territorial waters. Many Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
depend heavily on marine resources, but the benefits from conservation and management measures in ABNJ will not be evenly distributed. By highlighting which regions of ABNJ are most connected to coastal LDCs and other developing coastal states via ocean currents, the project helped the parties ensure that area-based management regimes in ABNJ protect these countries' interests and rights. We have run a side event at the UNCLOS negotiations in March 2019, based on the project publication (Popova et al., 2019) and the policy briefs (as listed in research fish with the key word ABNJ)

The approach brought concrete results: the latest draft of the negotiating text was updated to recognise that the treaty must protect the many millions of people who depend on the high seas.","https://www.un.org/bbnj/sites/www.un.org.bbnj/files/draft_text_a.conf_.232.2019.6_advanced_unedited_version_corr.pdf","5e6780106389e4.60807887","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5e6780106389e4.60807887&grantRef=NE%2FR000123%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/R000123/1","7E52DFF5-E7E8-42E8-BF21-5C9181D9B0AE","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","B17B3FE8-113A-47B9-85C8-E0D3D59EFEB6"

"EPSRC","EP/L024772/1","Research Grant","Policy Influence","University of Exeter","Physics","Moger","Julian","","Banning mircoplastics: Label-free imaging provides key evidence of accumulation of microplastics in marine organisms","Gave evidence to a government review",,"Europe","Plastics are being disposed of at an unprecedented rate. However, much of the plastic we create is hidden: for example, in 2013, a typical exfoliating shower gel was found to contain roughly as much microplastic in the cosmetic formulation as was used to make the plastic packaging it comes in. However, these hidden plastics do not degrade, and when used in cosmetics, easily find their way into marine environments when washed. It has been estimated that microplastics present in our oceans are costing approximately $13 billion per year in environmental damage, and bringing uncounted damage to our marine ecosystems.
However, it is very difficult to accurately determine the total amount and true effect of microplastic particles in the environment, as they can be hard to detect. Work by a cross-disciplinary team at Exeter made a significant contribution to our understanding of the impact of microplastics on the world's oceans and their potential to cause wide-spread ecological damage. The research has provided instrumental evidence for policy changes; resulting in a legal UK ban of microbeads in cosmetics and personal care products; and changes to European, North American and UN global policies. It has supported the campaigns of numerous non-profit organizations and stimulated huge public interest internationally. Throughout this campaign, the label-free microscopy techniques developed by Moger provided vital evidence of the ingestion and accumulation of microplastics in marine organisms, and the visual impact of the images played a key role in influencing policy change.
In February 2013, the team's research findings supported a successful effort on behalf of NERC, various academic institutions and non-profit organisations to include microplastics in a UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee inquiry into water quality. Parliamentarians were informed about the negative effects of microplastics, with the team's research cited in the Government Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) notes on Trends in the Environment in 2015 and Marine Microplastic Pollution in 2016, both citing papers with images taken by the Moger Group. In June 2016, the research was presented, including images from the Moger group, to an Environmental Audit Committee hearing on Microbeads in the Marine Environment at the Houses of Parliament. The submission influenced a change in legislation to outlaw microscopic plastics from being added to consumer products, which was announced following the enquiry in August 2016 and came into force in January 2018. 
Verifying the presence of microplastics in marine organisms had a substantial impact on environmental policy and practice. The Chair of the Audit Committee specifically noted the contribution of the label-free images towards the case for the environmental impact of microplastics, commenting that &quot;the provocative nature of these striking images made a particular impact as evidence of uptake into the food chain&quot;.
The Exeter team's research has also had significant influence beyond the UK. In Canada, a report published by the Canadian Environment Agency 'Microbeads - a Science Summary' references papers by the team and recommends that, based on the available information, &quot;microbeads be considered toxic under subsection 64(a) of the Environmental Protection Act 1999&quot;. In the US, the Microbead-Free Waters Act (2015) is informed by NOAA reports produced as part of their Marine Debris Program which referenced papers with images taken by the Moger Group. In 2019 and 2020 the European Chemicals Agency Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC) released reports, citing papers with images from the Moger Group], proposing restrictions on intentionally-added microplastics as an appropriate EU-wide measure to address the identified risks.
Political action on microbeads has now expanded worldwide, with the United Nations supporting resolutions to drastically reduce plastic pollution. Moger's work again played a key role: In June 2016 results were presented, including images produced by Moger, to the United Nations Consultation on the Laws of the Oceans, held in New York. Evidence was then presented to the UN General Assembly on 13 September 2016 which contained four references to oral evidence provided by the Exeter team. Finally, in December 2017, more than 200 nations represented at the United Nations Environment Assembly resolved to eliminate marine plastic pollution. Parallel to this, the G7 pledged to reduce uncontrolled disposal of waste plastics as one of its strategic development goals, which aims to reduce marine debris and microplastics by encouraging improvements to legislation, waste management and social education.
The UN resolution referenced the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report 'Marine plastic debris and microplastics - Global lessons and research to inspire action and guide policy change', which itself directly referenced publications from the Moger group. As a result of Moger's pioneering work, nonlinear optical microscopy is now viewed as a benchmark for analysing the effects of plastic pollutants in biological systems. In the UN Environment Programme GESAMP (Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Policy) advice documents, Moger's research approach was specifically cited as a precedent for how to accurately measure marine microplastics. 
To conclude, the Moger group has developed and used novel microscopy approaches which are capable, for the first time, of quantifying the take-up of plastic pollutants in real biological systems. The striking visual impact of the images acquired played a key role in generating pivotal policy changes to ban the use of microplastics in cosmetics and personal care products in the UK, Europe, and across the world. At the time of submission to REF 2021, the governments of 15 major developed countries have banned (or committed to banning) the use microplastics in cosmetics, and many of the world's largest cosmetics brands have pledged to remove microplastics from their products, including Unilever, L'Or&eacute;al, Colgate-Palmolive, Beiersdorf, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The UK ban alone has already resulted in an estimated reduction of 4,000 tonnes per year of microplastics entering our oceans, improving the health of marine organisms and their environments.",,"6229201fdd2276.51644179","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=6229201fdd2276.51644179&grantRef=EP%2FL024772%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/L024772/1","306C7237-C1C0-48F2-A4C0-2E40AF03B72B","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","AC3C6E69-AD45-4A8B-B41C-13F1C97A374A"

This will have influenced both the Select Committee, emphasizing the high degree of feasibility of such approaches, while the written evidence is now available on line, while the hearing is on Parliament TV. Among the findings I reported was that nitrogen pollution emissions in Europe amount to around €15 billion per year as lost fertilizer value and between €70 to €320 billion per year in terms of social and environmental costs. This emphasizes the strong green economy and circular economy case for taking actions to reduce these losses, keeping nitrogen in the farming system and while simultaneously reducing environmental pollution.

Over this period I have worked closely with colleagues to develop policies to reduce the environmental impact of the College activities. This has included driving the roll out of remote metering and telemetry of our operations and ensuring that these issues have been embedded into the agenda and decision-making of the institution as a whole. We have driven forward significant student and staff involvement in behaviour change and in planning. For example water use in my own Department has dropped by about 60%. Overall, UCL's estate's energy use has remained static against a background of a 40% increase in size.

https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-the-uk-climate-projections-2018

&quot;It's almost impossible to overstate the importance of UK climate projections in facilitating debate and action on adapting to climate change&quot; said Glenn Watts, Deputy Director of Research at the Environment Agency.

The UK's most comprehensive picture yet of how the climate could change over the next century has been launched today by Environment Secretary Michael Gove.

Using the latest science from the Met Office and around the world, the UK Climate Projections 2018 illustrate a range of future climate scenarios until 2100 - showing increasing summer temperatures, more extreme weather and rising sea levels are all on the horizon and urgent international action is needed.

To help homes and businesses plan for the future, the results set out a range of possible outcomes over the next century based on different rates of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The high emission scenario shows:

 Summer temperatures could be up to 5.4C hotter by 2070, while winters could be up to 4.2C warmer
 The chance of a summer as hot as 2018 is around 50% by 2050
 Sea levels in London could rise by up to 1.15 metres by 2100
 Average summer rainfall could decrease by up to 47 per cent by 2070, while there could be up to 35 per cent more precipitation in winter.

Sea levels are projected to rise over the 21st century and beyond under all emission scenarios - meaning we can expect to see an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme water levels around the UK coastline.

The UK already leads the world in tackling climate change - with emissions reduced by more than 40 per cent since 1990. However these projections show a future we could face without further action.

UKCP18 can now be used as a tool to guide decision-making and boost resilience - whether that's through increasing flood defences, designing new infrastructure or adjusting ways of farming for drier summers.

Speaking today from the Science Museum in London, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said:

 This cutting-edge science opens our eyes to the extent of the challenge we face, and shows us a future we want to avoid.

 The UK is already a global leader in tackling climate change, cutting emissions by more than 40 per cent since 1990 - but we must go further.

 By having this detailed picture of our changing climate, we can ensure we have the right infrastructure to cope with weather extremes, homes and businesses can adapt, and we can make decisions for the future accordingly.

Today's projections are the first major update of climate projections in nearly 10 years, building on the success of UKCP09 and ensuring the most up-to-date scientific evidence informs decision-making.

With climate change a global challenge, for the first time, UKCP presents international projections, allowing other nations to use this data to gauge future risks for food supply chains, or check rainfall projections for the likelihood of localised flooding.

Defra's Chief Scientific Adviser Ian Boyd said:

 Climate change will affect everybody. UKCP18 is designed to help everybody make better decisions, from those buying a house to people making large investments in infrastructure. It has been produced using state-of-the-art methods.

Met Office Chief Scientist Stephen Belcher said:

 The new science in UKCP18 enables us to move from looking at the trends associated with climate change, to describing how seasonal weather patterns will change. For example, heatwaves like the one we experienced in the summer of 2018 could be normal for the UK by mid-century.

While the UK continues to play a leading role in limiting the causes of global warming and halting temperature rises, some changes to the climate are inevitable. Building on the UK government's long-term plan for adapting to a changing climate, these projections will help businesses, investors, local authorities, industry and individuals plan for a wide range of possible future changes - alongside taking action to reduce the likelihood of the worst-case scenario becoming reality.

Today's announcement also comes as the UK marks the 10th anniversary of its Climate Change Act - the world's first legally binding legislation to tackle climate change. Just last month the government hosted Green GB Week - a week of action highlighting the economic opportunities from tackling climate change, encouraging communities and businesses to do more.

While these projections highlight the need for further urgent action, since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by more than 40 per cent while growing the economy by more than two thirds, the best performance on a per person basis than any other G7 nation.

Claire Perry, Minister for Energy and Clean Growth said:

 These projections from leading UK scientists build on last month's report from climate experts, highlighting the stark reality that we must do more to tackle climate change in order to avoid devastating impacts on our health and prosperity.

 We are already leading the world in the fight against climate change but we cannot be complacent. As we look towards crucial global climate talks in Poland next week, it is clear that now, more than ever, is the time for collective and ambitious action to tackle this urgent challenge.

While it is not possible to give a precise prediction of how weather and climate will change years into the future, UKCP18 provides a range of outcomes that capture the spread of possible future climates, so we can develop and test robust plans.

The projections will be factored into the UK's flood adaptation planning and the Environment Agency's advice to flood and coastal erosion risk management authorities.

Since 2010 government has invested a record &pound;2.6 billion in flood defences, and we are on track to protect 300,000 more homes from flooding by 2021.

Chair of the Environment Agency, Emma Howard Boyd, said:

 The UK18 projections are further evidence that we will see more extreme weather in the future - we need to prepare and adapt now, climate change impacts are already being felt with the record books being re-written.

 It is not too late to act. Working together - governments, business, and communities - we can mitigate the impacts of climate change and adapt to a different future.

 The Environment Agency cannot wall up the country, but will be at the forefront - protecting communities, building resilience, and responding to incidents.

UKCP18 has been developed by the Met Office Hadley Centre, in partnership with Defra, BEIS, the Devolved Administrations and the Environment Agency, and has been extensively peer reviewed by an independent science panel.

People and businesses will be able to use UKCP18 to explore the types and magnitude of climate change projected for the future, while government will use the projections to inform its adaptation and mitigation planning and decision-making.","https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/collaboration/ukcp","5c7cf1645e0b13.06484390","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5c7cf1645e0b13.06484390&grantRef=NE%2FP01321X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/P01321X/1","9B45ACC3-1333-4280-A9D0-8862EEDC4BF7","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","165347B6-E335-470F-8E2B-5C804D1E4DB1"

AQEG advice has informed thinking around solutions to air pollution hotspots, has provided input to the development of consultation documents and ultimately the policy development process. This contributes to our ability in the UK to improve air quality and reduce the impacts on human health and the environment.

Through my role, enhanced by this fellowship, as an embedded academic in the Defra Air Quality Team (AQT) and my role as secretariat of AQEG I was working on improved mechanisms for communicating policy relevant science to Defra. I worked with the AQT and AQEG Chair to enable AQEG to provide more agile advice on issues from future evidence provision to development of policy options. To enable this there was increased engagement from policy and evidence officials from across the AQT including consultation with me about the best way to use AQEG to advise on issues, requests for time on AQEG meeting agendas for ad-hoc discussions and regular attendance at AQEG meetings. This enabled for example a discussion of potential negative impacts of restricting domestic solid fuel burning, consultation on the content of the Defra Future Evidence Programme to spend a &pound;7M investment in air quality and early consultation on the proposed content of the draft Clean Air Strategy.","http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/aqeg/","56bb492057fea5.02734763","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=56bb492057fea5.02734763&grantRef=NE%2FN005430%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/N005430/1","CA17C511-BAB4-43FD-A7BE-CA54FB2C9F21","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","8319F78A-DCBD-49F6-BE00-78E1CD75CDA9","26BD2ED2-8A78-4E69-AAFA-C43306C11C57"

More of these must be organized and continually monitored. The processes must be locally owned by the Nairobi Counties and thus their inputs are critical just like other stakeholders. The meeting involved the political, legal and technical arms of the governments.

All agreed to the need to collectively act on improving AQ in the metropolis starting with Mapping the activities and policy engagements of each county to know where to start.

The collective actions that the four Counties can engage in were mapped out. 

The need to organize County consultative forums for each county then a joint one again were over emphasized. The forums are to engage a broader base of stakeholders and departments within each County bringing in all the arms of the government. This will enhance the political buy in and even trigger budgetary allocations. 

The Integrated AQ management framework idea received lots of support and needs to be finalized and operationalized through further consultative engagements and policy support.

The specific AQ policies and laws at the County need to be specified and actions towards their drafting and enactment should start soon.

Capacity building needs in the Counties must be assessed and acted on for sustainability

Used for public supply and until recently for large industrial and brewery supply, it is also of importance as the main dewatering station for the Seven Railway Tunnel. 

Protecting groundwater is vital for long term management of both water resources and water quality enabling us to protect drinking water, industrial and agricultural supplies as well as maintaining the volume and quality of baseflow to rivers and wetlands. 

The BGS undertook a co-funded study with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) to implement a GIS-based methodology for delineating a karstic groundwater 'Source Protection Zone'. Planning and other activities, such as permitted discharges to ground, are tightly regulated within highly vulnerable karstic areas such as the Great Spring SPZ. New methodologies to approach the mapping of vulnerability in karst areas have been introduced since the existing SPZ was established, and this study was undertaken in order to help address the pressing requirement to update the NRW approach to assessing risks to groundwater within this catchment. The study comprised field-based revision of dated, 1920's, BGS baseline 1:50 000 scale geological mapping, capture of karsitc landforms and features using both field observation and interpretation of remote sensing data. These were combined with a synthesis of available hydrogeological information from the area and a new, field-base estimate of groundwater recharge from the Castroggi Brook, the main surface stream in the SPZ. The project delivered new digital data to the DiGigMap50 and Karstic Hazard datasets as well as a GIS-based methodology for defining the SPZ.
This project is the first time that the vulnerability mapping on karst methodology has been applied to an SPZ in Wales. The output has benefitted both NRW and Welsh Water/Dwr Cymru and a range of stakeholders, from land owners to developers by providing a better defined and justifiable outline to the SPZ. The SPZ is being used on NRW GIS systems to support decisions on new planning, permitting and licensing applications within the Great Spring SPZ. 

The report provides an improved understanding of where groundwater is most vulnerable, based on the presence or absence of protective cover and bypass features. It will also have a direct impact on how NRW respond to planning, permits and other activities. The study has also identified gaps in the current knowledge and collaborative research that could be taken forward.",,"545a45c02637d0.96667067","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=545a45c02637d0.96667067&grantRef=bgs05001","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=bgs05001","96C7E3B2-C169-4489-BE38-328DCAB65DB4","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","7ADE0AB2-1050-4241-987D-F3B1C3322E05","9E2BE58F-7506-446B-A181-0693A20B5A7A"

We are pleased to be able to provide you with a brief update on a few of our shared workstreams.&quot;
Please find attached for your information the finalized policy brief on infrastructure and climate. Many thanks to those of you who provided inputs!

We would also like to let you know that we are working with some UN partner agencies and the UN Environmental Management Group (EMG) to organize an interagency &quot;Nexus Dialogue&quot; on sustainable infrastructure to be held 26th of February in Geneva. More information to follow, but we wanted to flag the date for those of you interested in attending.

Thank you all for your continuing engagement on sustainable infrastructure. We are pleased to be able to provide you with a brief update on a few of our shared workstreams:

1. With inputs and endorsement from a number of you and your organization, we developed the attached policy brief on the infrastructure-biodiversity nexus. It was released at the start of the CBD COP last Saturday, and is also available for download on the Green Growth Knowledge Platform (GGKP). Please feel free to share it amongst your own networks as you see fit. And THANK YOU to all those who provided input.

2. In order to take advantage of the policy window provided by the upcoming climate COP in Poland, we are developing a similar policy brief on the infrastructure-climate nexus. Please see attached zero draft for review and comment. Please send any comments or edits back by COB, Monday, November 26. As with the biodiversity brief, please let us know if your institution is interested in endorsing the brief.

3. The sustainable infrastructure expert meeting that was held in Fuzhou on the 22-23 October was a great success -thanks to those of you who were able to attend and for your contributions. The meeting summary is now available, along with the presentations, on the event web page that is hosted on the GGKP.

4. Taking further advantage of the GGKP as a resource, we have also created a sustainable infrastructure page to serve as a makeshift home for our growing network of partners working on sustainable infrastructure. We can upload knowledge products to the GGKP library and link to them from the page, list upcoming and past events, write blog posts, and probably more. The GGKP currently receives about 18,000 unique site visits per month and has around 60 partner organizations, so it is a great way to share information about sustainable infrastructure. We are in the process of slowly uploading some 50 or so sustainable infrastructure-relevant documents (reports, papers, etc.) that we have come across during our research (many of them from your institutions). However, if you have additional sustainable infrastructure-related knowledge products you would like to add to the library, please send them to Ben Smith (bsmith@ggkp.org, copying Vanessa.bauer@un.org) for inclusion. And please let us know if you would like to be listed as a partner organization on the sustainable infrastructure page, and we can add your logo. The more the better. 

Thank you for your ongoing collaboration. Best, Rowan [Palmer]

FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper No. 644. This document includes eight studies showcasing good practices in support of sustainable small-scale fisheries. FAO commissioned these studies aiming to share experiences and promote the implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines). The case studies were also intended to promote participatory approaches - in line with the SSF Guidelines principles - and to promote increased interaction between research and fishing communities, including the use of traditional knowledge and participatory research. It is hoped that the case studies will inform policy and policy processes and, in this way, promote sustainable small-scale fisheries according to the SSF Guidelines and the human rights-based approach to development (HRBA). The case studies constitute a rich selection of experiences and are diverse, not only with regard to their geographical setting but also in scope and approach. They span from looking at one specific tool for sharing experiences (the fisheries learning exchanges methodology in Madagascar and Mozambique) or examining the enabling environment in a specific thematic area (disaster risks in Bangladesh), to regional policy formulation on small-scale fisheries (the SSF Guidelines protocol for Caribbean policies) and reflection on how to use the SSF Guidelines in participatory processes (the Myanmar step-by-step approach to discussions with small-scale fisheries communities). A few of the papers look at co-management, in some cases combining fisheries management and social development (Senegal, Uruguay and Nepal), with one focusing on the role of small-scale fisheries and community organizations (India). Generally, the case studies refer to HRBA but, perhaps because many of the activities have taken place in the past, it seems that HRBA has rarely been consciously and explicitly implemented. Still, the case studies bear witness to a number of experiences and practices that are clearly steps in the right direction. Key good practices emerging from the studies refer to, among other things, holistic approaches to co-management and social responsibility; broad engagement, inclusiveness and partnerships; the power of communication; and gender equality and the role of women. As more experience is gained, our knowledge of how to go about implementing the SSF Guidelines will
improve and nurture new and continued initiatives. For the present and the future, efforts should be made to apply HRBA, while continuing to share experiences and good practices showing how to do so when implementing the SSF Guidelines.","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/CA3041EN","604243d28f9d95.27865882","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=604243d28f9d95.27865882&grantRef=NE%2FM007634%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M007634/1","3A883A23-8E2B-4ABE-B696-60FE1B564D80","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","813F6E5A-7C55-44B1-BC26-C77FF12DBD2C"

While the inquiry has not yet been launched, I am confident that it will make a difference to the areas highlighted above.

Here is our University press release, which has more details:

&quot;Professor Toby Bruce has secured a full Government inquiry into the role of science and technology in addressing challenges to food security and biodiversity, following his successful pitch to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee in January.

Professor Bruce's pitch was one of just four chosen to be taken forward as a full Government inquiry. The committee has combined Professor Bruce's recommendations on food security and crop protection with a related topic on gene editing techniques from Nicola Patron of the Earlham Institute.

A report published this week by the Science and Technology Committee said: &quot;Professor Toby Bruce suggested that we should hold an inquiry into food security, the environment and crop protection. He suggested that an inquiry could look at the tools available to farmers to protect crops against pests, weeds and diseases, how these had changed over time, what changes were needed to ensure food security in the future and research investment in crop protection. We will incorporate this into an inquiry into the role of science and technology in addressing challenges to food security and biodiversity.&quot;

Professor Bruce said: &quot;I am delighted that 'My Science Inquiry' is being taken forward to a full inquiry and look forward to working with the Commons Science and Technology Committee. There is an urgent need for increased research and innovation to help improve food security and protect the environment. I hope that the forthcoming inquiry will be a catalyst for change and will help to address some serious limitations that currently impede our innovation system, particularly with respect to providing new options for protecting harvests from pests&quot;.

During the presentation of his research, Professor Bruce said: &quot;The choice we have at the moment is having to choose between food security and the environment, so we need to find a way forward in which we can safeguard our crops without environmental impact, partly through smarter regulation to bring more inventions into the market. There is a critical shortage of new treatments but there's also underinvestment in this area. It's a major challenge that we face this century, how do we feed the world without wrecking the environment in the process.&quot;

The Commons Science and Technology Committee will launch their inquiry into the role of science and technology in addressing challenges to food security and biodiversity within the next 12 months.&quot;","http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news-parliament-2017/my-science-inquiry-report-publication-17-19/","5c83a747a25671.71837558","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5c83a747a25671.71837558&grantRef=NE%2FM016676%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M016676/1","8F8A0E59-3CE7-4875-B173-86D6C5EA75AD","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","ACD5F1CF-266C-4CDE-A399-43DC93429CF9","9D7CBCCD-2C71-4D40-8361-B0E705C80FB2"

Agriculture has been neglected since the last Green Revolution in the 1960s and 21st Century challenges need to be taken more seriously. The Commons STC is a high level committee overseeing delivery of science across all government departments.

While the inquiry has not yet been launched, I am confident that it will make a difference to the areas highlighted above.

Here is our University press release, which has more details:

&quot;Professor Toby Bruce has secured a full Government inquiry into the role of science and technology in addressing challenges to food security and biodiversity, following his successful pitch to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee in January.

Professor Bruce's pitch was one of just four chosen to be taken forward as a full Government inquiry. The committee has combined Professor Bruce's recommendations on food security and crop protection with a related topic on gene editing techniques from Nicola Patron of the Earlham Institute.

A report published this week by the Science and Technology Committee said: &quot;Professor Toby Bruce suggested that we should hold an inquiry into food security, the environment and crop protection. He suggested that an inquiry could look at the tools available to farmers to protect crops against pests, weeds and diseases, how these had changed over time, what changes were needed to ensure food security in the future and research investment in crop protection. We will incorporate this into an inquiry into the role of science and technology in addressing challenges to food security and biodiversity.&quot;

Professor Bruce said: &quot;I am delighted that 'My Science Inquiry' is being taken forward to a full inquiry and look forward to working with the Commons Science and Technology Committee. There is an urgent need for increased research and innovation to help improve food security and protect the environment. I hope that the forthcoming inquiry will be a catalyst for change and will help to address some serious limitations that currently impede our innovation system, particularly with respect to providing new options for protecting harvests from pests&quot;.

It acts as the de-facto regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO) across the Southern Ocean with responsibility for ensuring the sustainable management of the region's fish stocks. In practice, the remit of CCAMLR greatly exceeds that of an RFMO, as its primary objective is conservation. From the outset CCAMLR has adopted an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) and therefore considers the broad environmental impacts of fishing in addition to sustainably managing target species.

BAS scientists continue to make substantial contributions to CCAMLR as part of the UK delegation, attending all of the scientific working groups, Scientific Committee and Commission meetings. BAS-authored scientific papers underpin much of the science advice that is adopted by CCAMLR. BAS provide the UK -FCDO and GSGSSI with scientific advice on a broad range of areas related to the management of the marine environment in the Southern Ocean helping to ensure the UK remains a leader in CCAMLR affairs. BAS Ecosystems scientist, Dr Sophie Fielding is in the first year of a three year term as convenor of the Working Group on Acoustics Survey and Analysis Methods. In 2020, all of the CCAMLR meeting were conducted online, with a focused agenda and BAS scientists participated fully. A key focus of the working groups was the development of a three-stranded approach to krill fishery management, which has been led by BAS scientists (Phil Trathan, Sophie Fielding, Simeon Hill and Vicky Warwick-Evans). BAS scientists Phil Trathan and Martin Collins also attended the CCAMLR Scientific Committee and Commission, with Susie Grant attending on behalf of SCAR (see below). An independent initiative to protect the Southern Ocean ecosystem from the potential effects of fishing involves a set of Voluntary Restricted Zones where the fishing industry refrains from fishing. These zones are established and updated by a Review Panel which is advised by an expert group of scientists, including Simeon Hill.

A unique initiative designed to enhance engagement between scientists, NGOs and the krill fishing industry (the Antarctic Wildlife Research Fund, AWR; www.antarcticfund.org/) provides research funds to undertake independent peer-reviewed science to enhance scientific understanding related to CCAMLR's objective. The AWR Scientific Advisory Group includes Phil Trathan who previously chaired the group for its first five years.",,"56defa46eb3897.18956963","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=56defa46eb3897.18956963&grantRef=bas0100035","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=bas0100035","45F57C26-E7F4-40CD-B7DF-5D38767B3587","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","21CFC584-0BCD-450C-B2C1-EFF574194DBF","138BADBE-2FB1-4D7C-9444-DBD7AC82DF43"

FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper No. 644. This document includes eight studies showcasing good practices in support of sustainable small-scale fisheries. FAO commissioned these studies aiming to share experiences and promote the implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines). The case studies were also intended to promote participatory approaches - in line with the SSF Guidelines principles - and to promote increased interaction between research and fishing communities, including the use of traditional knowledge and participatory research. It is hoped that the case studies will inform policy and policy processes and, in this way, promote sustainable small-scale fisheries according to the SSF Guidelines and the human rights-based approach to development (HRBA). The case studies constitute a rich selection of experiences and are diverse, not only with regard to their geographical setting but also in scope and approach. They span from looking at one specific tool for sharing experiences (the fisheries learning exchanges methodology in Madagascar and Mozambique) or examining the enabling environment in a specific thematic area (disaster risks in Bangladesh), to regional policy formulation on small-scale fisheries (the SSF Guidelines protocol for Caribbean policies) and reflection on how to use the SSF Guidelines in participatory processes (the Myanmar step-by-step approach to discussions with small-scale fisheries communities). A few of the papers look at co-management, in some cases combining fisheries management and social development (Senegal, Uruguay and Nepal), with one focusing on the role of small-scale fisheries and community organizations (India). Generally, the case studies refer to HRBA but, perhaps because many of the activities have taken place in the past, it seems that HRBA has rarely been consciously and explicitly implemented. Still, the case studies bear witness to a number of experiences and practices that are clearly steps in the right direction. Key good practices emerging from the studies refer to, among other things, holistic approaches to co-management and social responsibility; broad engagement, inclusiveness and partnerships; the power of communication; and gender equality and the role of women. As more experience is gained, our knowledge of how to go about implementing the SSF Guidelines will
improve and nurture new and continued initiatives. For the present and the future, efforts should be made to apply HRBA, while continuing to share experiences and good practices showing how to do so when implementing the SSF Guidelines.","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/CA3041EN","604243d28f9d95.27865882","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=604243d28f9d95.27865882&grantRef=NE%2FL008750%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L008750/1","3793BD7F-091A-45D4-9111-57CCEC4F5539","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","813F6E5A-7C55-44B1-BC26-C77FF12DBD2C"

The dialogue produced an Outcome Statement on how integrated approaches can help to deliver the 2030 Agenda.
The coming decades will require large amounts of investment in new and existing infrastructure. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that an annual average of USD 6.9 trillion in infrastructure investment until 2030 is required to support global development. The bulk of this investment is taking place in developing countries, including fragile low-income economies and emerging economies, and is driven by a lack of development and infrastructure needed to meet the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, population growth, increased income levels, and rapid urbanization in the context of growing inequality and climate change.
This Outcome Statement reflects the discussions held during the Nexus Dialogue on sustainable infrastructure that was organized by the UN Environment Management Group and UN Environment's Sustainable Infrastructure Partnership. It has benefitted from the inputs of colleagues from Duke University, ETH Zurich, GGGI, GGKP, GLO, ILO, ITRC at the University of Oxford, IUCN, OECD, OHCHR, UNECE, UNEMG, UN Environment, UNEP-WCMC, UNDP, UNIDO, UNISDR, UNITAR, the University of Geneva, UNOPS, UN Women, and WWF.

FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper No. 644. This document includes eight studies showcasing good practices in support of sustainable small-scale fisheries. FAO commissioned these studies aiming to share experiences and promote the implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines). The case studies were also intended to promote participatory approaches - in line with the SSF Guidelines principles - and to promote increased interaction between research and fishing communities, including the use of traditional knowledge and participatory research. It is hoped that the case studies will inform policy and policy processes and, in this way, promote sustainable small-scale fisheries according to the SSF Guidelines and the human rights-based approach to development (HRBA). The case studies constitute a rich selection of experiences and are diverse, not only with regard to their geographical setting but also in scope and approach. They span from looking at one specific tool for sharing experiences (the fisheries learning exchanges methodology in Madagascar and Mozambique) or examining the enabling environment in a specific thematic area (disaster risks in Bangladesh), to regional policy formulation on small-scale fisheries (the SSF Guidelines protocol for Caribbean policies) and reflection on how to use the SSF Guidelines in participatory processes (the Myanmar step-by-step approach to discussions with small-scale fisheries communities). A few of the papers look at co-management, in some cases combining fisheries management and social development (Senegal, Uruguay and Nepal), with one focusing on the role of small-scale fisheries and community organizations (India). Generally, the case studies refer to HRBA but, perhaps because many of the activities have taken place in the past, it seems that HRBA has rarely been consciously and explicitly implemented. Still, the case studies bear witness to a number of experiences and practices that are clearly steps in the right direction. Key good practices emerging from the studies refer to, among other things, holistic approaches to co-management and social responsibility; broad engagement, inclusiveness and partnerships; the power of communication; and gender equality and the role of women. As more experience is gained, our knowledge of how to go about implementing the SSF Guidelines will
improve and nurture new and continued initiatives. For the present and the future, efforts should be made to apply HRBA, while continuing to share experiences and good practices showing how to do so when implementing the SSF Guidelines.","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/CA3041EN","604243d28f9d95.27865882","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=604243d28f9d95.27865882&grantRef=NE%2FM00693X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M00693X/1","B5F089F0-103F-4460-BA01-1B7A031C9624","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","813F6E5A-7C55-44B1-BC26-C77FF12DBD2C"

During their visit to PACT, the Committee participated in an introductory discussion on the equipment at PACT and its applications and then made a detailed tour of the site. In the afternoon, the Committee met at the University of Sheffield, taking evidence from CCS experts including UKCCSRC Members. A transcript of the evidence is available on the ECCC web site (http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/energy-and-climate-change-committee/carbon-capture-and-storage/oral/5618.pdf).

Tim Yeo MP, Chair of the Committee, said of the day &quot;Carbon capture and storage could be a key technology helping us to decarbonise our power sector and heavy industry. There is currently a disappointing lack of progress on developing CCS. The PACT facilities are an excellent example of the types of R&amp;D projects the UK should be investing in to ensure we have a home grown low-carbon industry here in the UK. I look forward to seeing firsthand how the facilities are bridging the gap between bench-scale R&amp;D and industrial pilot scale projects accelerating the development of novel carbon capture technologies. I am sure that our experience here will help to feed into our wider work on CCS.&quot;","https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/energy-and-climate-change-select-committee-visit-ukccsrc-pact-23-january-2014","5464889ab636b9.03065479","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5464889ab636b9.03065479&grantRef=EP%2FK000446%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/2","209A1667-A0A9-4BD2-AE81-D18E6DEEF424","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4"

'The Evidence-Based Infrastructure approach, developed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and the Infrastructure Transition Research Consortium (ITRC) at the University of Oxford, is designed to account for the interconnections among infrastructure systems and environmental, social, and economic factors, and is intended for use in developing country contexts (Hall et al., 2016). Its application is supported by a suite of analytical tools, including a Capacity Assessment Tool for Infrastructure (CAT-I) and the National Infrastructure Systems Model (NISMOD), which utilizes a &quot;system-of-systems&quot; approach to ensure that cross-sectoral interdependencies are identified, and synergies optimized (Ibid., 2016). These existing tools and approaches together form a complementary &quot;tool box&quot; that planners and policymakers can use to adopt integrated approaches to the planning and development of sustainable infrastructure that supports the 2030 Agenda.

"NERC","NE/J000507/2","Research Grant","Policy Influence","University College London","Genetics Evolution and Environment","Jones","Kate","","Evidence to UK Parliament, and other international organisations","Participation in a advisory committee",,"Multiple continents/international","The impact of research from this grant falls into three main areas: informing zoonotic disease research funding; influencing international policy priorities and public health responses to disease outbreaks; and improving public understanding of links between environmental change and zoonotic disease spill-over risk. As evidenced by communication from the Wellcome's Director: &quot;This research has had a global impact over many years, events of the last twelve months have underlined just how critical it is to all our health here in the UK, in so many countries around the world and to global health security&quot;.

Informing research funding priorities for zoonotic diseases:
Evidence from this research has contributed to the 2020 Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report on Biodiversity &amp; Pandemics, has influenced the establishment of the EU's PREZODE initiative to develop fundamental and operational research to prevent and manage future zoonotic disease outbreaks. Key evidence on zoonotic spill-over has informed the 2020 Trinity Challenge (a coalition aiming to improve the world's protection against health emergencies, using data-driven research and analytics) representing millions of pounds of investment. Trinity Challenge Board Chair and former UK Chief Medical Officer Dame Professor said: &quot;Your work on identifying global hotspots and EID risk has informed a lot of our early thinking in our &quot;Identify&quot; category of The Trinity Challenge&quot;. 

Policy and public health responses: 
Evidence from the research was used for the rapid assessment report (2020) by United Nations Environment Programme 'Preventing the next Pandemic' led to UNEP joining an alliance with OIE, FAO and WHO, recognising that there was a need to strengthen the environmental dimension of One Health global efforts. 
Underpinning evidence provided to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) 'Beyond Boundaries' 2020 report contributed directly to WWF's ongoing work to influence policy and practice in a range of areas on linkages between environmental degradation, emerging infectious disease risk and human health. One example is the organisation's work around mitigating the risk posed by the wildlife trade, particularly in East and South East Asia.
Evidence on the impact of ecosystem degradation on zoonotic risk in 2020 for The Dasgupta Review commissioned by the UK's HM Treasury setting out how nature should be accounted for in economics and decision making. This will inform policy discussions at CBD COP 15, UNFCCC COP 26, and the G7 meeting in 2021. 
In 2019, as evidenced by communication with the Chief Scientific Officer at FCDO: &quot;The Ebola risk map from Redding et al. provided important contextual information to inform discussions with ministers in our short and medium term thinking on our response to Ebola&quot;.
Finally, evidence on zoonotic disease emergence is informing current discussions within UK government and the G7 to develop a more strategic approach to understanding emerging zoonotic and biodiversity threats.

Increasing public understanding of zoonotic disease risk
The research in understanding zoonotic disease spill-over processes has been communicated extensively through the international broadcast news and print media over the assessment period, thereby improving public understanding of zoonotic disease risks. Clear scientific communication has been particularly relevant during the global COVID-19 pandemic and the research team have appeared in over 150 national, specialist, and international media outlets in 2020, sharing the research with an estimated audience of over 300 million people. Highlights have included contributions to BBC Radio 4's flagship news show the 'Today Programme' and its 'Inside Science' programme, as well as the BBC World Service. Additionally, Professor Jones gave a cross-departmental talk within the UK Government on predicting pandemics and co-wrote, with Dr Redding, a special briefing to UK Government's Cabinet Office. This informed several of the UK prime minister's speeches for example, to the UN Summit on Biodiversity and to the UN General Assembly in 2020. The research also helped to provide evidence on the environmental links to the emergence of zoonotic diseases for the UK Environmental Audit Committee in 2020.

UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI) has recently published two reports giving an analysis of the UK's existing research landscape (https://www.ukri.org/files/infrastructure/landscape-analysis-final-web-version/) and identifying opportunities to grow the UK's research and innovation infrastructure capacity (https://www.ukri.org/files/infrastructure/the-uks-research-and-innovation-infrastructure-opportunities-to-grow-our-capacity-final-low-res/) in the period to 2030. These reports make recommendations across six broad research sectors (including energy) identified as key to ensuring the UK remains a global leader.

A multi-disciplinary CESI team of researchers from Newcastle University led by Prof Phil Taylor were commissioned by UKRI to consult with the energy community. The extensive consultation process involved four facilitated workshops, two questionnaires and over 100 one-to-one interviews with energy experts from industry and academia. An important finding from initial consultations was that opportunities to grow future energy research and innovation infrastructure could be classified in seven key themes: Whole energy systems; fuel cells and hydrogen; energy storage; renewable energy sources; alternative fuels; nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage. Our findings and recommendations across these themes are included in the published reports. 

The Landscape Analysis report provides a snapshot view of existing energy infrastructure, of regional, national and international importance. The Opportunities to Grow our Capacity report makes recommendations for progressing the energy themes and highlighted case studies for each. The CESI Demonstrator, InTEGReL (https://www.ncl.ac.uk/cesi/research/demo/integrel/), is referenced on several occasions in this report as an example of the type of facility needed in future and in the case study for demonstrating a whole-systems approach to UK energy use.

Of particular relevance to CESI are the recommendations for the whole energy systems theme. These include a new interdisciplinary centre for excellence in energy analysis integration and a decarbonisation of heat demonstrator.","https://www.ukri.org/files/infrastructure/","5e53eaf2a348f7.60928615","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5e53eaf2a348f7.60928615&grantRef=EP%2FP001173%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/P001173/1","B311F68F-09E5-46D9-8CA5-1B6959BAF4B5","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68","641DCB26-9511-4E33-ABD7-85E2F24B9698"

"EPSRC","EP/P004210/1","Research Grant","Policy Influence","Open University","Faculty of Business and Law (FBL)","Potter","Karen","","Welsh Government sustainable drainage consultation","Participation in a national consultation",,"National","Our arguments have been noted in two instances in the 'Welsh Government Consultation - Summary of Responses and Welsh Government response' document https://beta.gov.wales/sites/default/files/consultations/2018-04/180425-suds-consultation-summary-of-responses.pdf. We were the sole academic contributor to the consultation. 

Instance 1: 
To the question: 'What information should the SAB be required to submit as part of a review mechanism of SAB approval costs? How often should the review take place, once every year or once every two years?' we have provided the following answer: 'In the previous consultation (05-08/17), a number of responses highlighted additional costs (e.g. from pursuing agreements, enforcement and supervision) that are not covered by the current fees. Local Authorities should be encouraged to monitor such costs, mainly staff resources, which when added to the proposed fees (such as &pound;350 per application), will provide evidence of the real costs of processing SuDS within the SAB. More frequent reporting (once a year) should be undertaken initially in the beginning to obtain a notion of the (real) average national costs. A breakdown by regions will be necessary as well. Less frequent reporting should be needed after a few years, when a more consistent notion of the real costs will have been obtained, while fees will need to be adjusted accordingly to reflect these costs. We feel these concerns should be addressed by WG through monitoring and review, particularly as arrangements bed in'

In the report, the Government has quoted the following: '&quot; In the previous consultation a number of responses highlighted additional costs that are not covered by the current fees. Local Authorities should be encouraged to monitor such costs which when added to the proposed fees will provide evidence of the real costs of processing SuDS within the SAB. More frequent reporting (once a year) should be undertaken initially in the beginning to obtain a notion of the (real) average national costs. A breakdown by regions will be necessary as well.&quot; Academia'
Many of the arguments that we are supporting here are reflected in the Government's response to the question, which reads as follows: 'Welsh Government response
We have continued to work with the Welsh Local Government Association to ensure the initial fee rates are set to reflect the cost recovery basis intended. We will charge SABs with the collection of suitable data to enable a review to be undertaken in April 2020 and 2021. By then there should be sufficient data to provide evidence to support any changes needed to the fees. The inclusion of the rate for fees in Regulation provides both applicants and the SABs with both certainty and consistency across Wales. We will include the fees in a separate set of Regulations, which will facilitate their future review'.

Instance 2: The report has noted the argument that we have made in favor of the role of non-performance bonds can play in the implementation of SuDS. Our research in Wales this year will determine the specific status of the non-performance bonds. It is worth pointing out that our submission was the only one mentioning non-performance bonds, pointing out their benefits but also drawing attention to the pitfalls that we identified in England. 

'Academia
One specific response sought to understand the role of non-performance bonds. It highlighted the response to the consultation for the Post-Legislative Scrutiny to the Flood and Water Management Act in England which had highlighted the benefits of non-performance bonds and the pitfalls of inadequate agreements on these.

&quot;For developers, non-performance bonds provide the needed incentive to take SuDS design and implementation seriously... non-performance bonds would... [provide] ...a financial cover for the Local Authority, ensuring that works are completed according to design and National Standards in all cases.&quot;21 '","https://beta.gov.wales/implementation-sustainable-drainage-systems-new-developments-draft-regulations-and-national","5a9806b0b4dca0.17813514","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5a9806b0b4dca0.17813514&grantRef=EP%2FP004210%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/P004210/1","8D3FC1FF-42B7-456D-B087-364D38D224D0","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","89E6D9CB-DAF8-40A2-A9EF-B330A5A7FC24","C7584FDE-EF76-4FF0-9224-4E586F4E9AB0"

"EPSRC","EP/P004180/1","Research Grant","Policy Influence","University of Nottingham","Sch of Geography","Thorne","Colin","http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2450-9624","Welsh Government sustainable drainage consultation","Participation in a national consultation",,"National","Our arguments have been noted in two instances in the 'Welsh Government Consultation - Summary of Responses and Welsh Government response' document https://beta.gov.wales/sites/default/files/consultations/2018-04/180425-suds-consultation-summary-of-responses.pdf. We were the sole academic contributor to the consultation. 

Instance 1: 
To the question: 'What information should the SAB be required to submit as part of a review mechanism of SAB approval costs? How often should the review take place, once every year or once every two years?' we have provided the following answer: 'In the previous consultation (05-08/17), a number of responses highlighted additional costs (e.g. from pursuing agreements, enforcement and supervision) that are not covered by the current fees. Local Authorities should be encouraged to monitor such costs, mainly staff resources, which when added to the proposed fees (such as &pound;350 per application), will provide evidence of the real costs of processing SuDS within the SAB. More frequent reporting (once a year) should be undertaken initially in the beginning to obtain a notion of the (real) average national costs. A breakdown by regions will be necessary as well. Less frequent reporting should be needed after a few years, when a more consistent notion of the real costs will have been obtained, while fees will need to be adjusted accordingly to reflect these costs. We feel these concerns should be addressed by WG through monitoring and review, particularly as arrangements bed in'

In the report, the Government has quoted the following: '&quot; In the previous consultation a number of responses highlighted additional costs that are not covered by the current fees. Local Authorities should be encouraged to monitor such costs which when added to the proposed fees will provide evidence of the real costs of processing SuDS within the SAB. More frequent reporting (once a year) should be undertaken initially in the beginning to obtain a notion of the (real) average national costs. A breakdown by regions will be necessary as well.&quot; Academia'
Many of the arguments that we are supporting here are reflected in the Government's response to the question, which reads as follows: 'Welsh Government response
We have continued to work with the Welsh Local Government Association to ensure the initial fee rates are set to reflect the cost recovery basis intended. We will charge SABs with the collection of suitable data to enable a review to be undertaken in April 2020 and 2021. By then there should be sufficient data to provide evidence to support any changes needed to the fees. The inclusion of the rate for fees in Regulation provides both applicants and the SABs with both certainty and consistency across Wales. We will include the fees in a separate set of Regulations, which will facilitate their future review'.

Instance 2: The report has noted the argument that we have made in favor of the role of non-performance bonds can play in the implementation of SuDS. Our research in Wales this year will determine the specific status of the non-performance bonds. It is worth pointing out that our submission was the only one mentioning non-performance bonds, pointing out their benefits but also drawing attention to the pitfalls that we identified in England. 

'Academia
One specific response sought to understand the role of non-performance bonds. It highlighted the response to the consultation for the Post-Legislative Scrutiny to the Flood and Water Management Act in England which had highlighted the benefits of non-performance bonds and the pitfalls of inadequate agreements on these.

&quot;For developers, non-performance bonds provide the needed incentive to take SuDS design and implementation seriously... non-performance bonds would... [provide] ...a financial cover for the Local Authority, ensuring that works are completed according to design and National Standards in all cases.&quot;21 '","https://beta.gov.wales/implementation-sustainable-drainage-systems-new-developments-draft-regulations-and-national","5a9806b0b4dca0.17813514","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5a9806b0b4dca0.17813514&grantRef=EP%2FP004180%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/P004180/1","7953DD03-3117-41FF-89A2-C6D36D4679E7","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","936D002F-A8D1-4A93-AE5D-825ED0903D8D","B1F2CA38-21D9-41EC-8CD9-68A7E9D068B1"

A new joint campaign by milk producer, Arla Cravendale and the Tesco supermarket chain suggests that a filtered milk product, with a shelf life of up to 21 days, could reduce household milk waste by up to 80%.

This estimation is based on the 'Household Simulation Model' developed by academics from the food waste charity, WRAP, and includes Dr Christian Reynolds, Lecturer at the Centre for Food Policy, City, University of London.

The Household Simulation Model utilises 'discrete event simulation' (DES) which is a method of simulating the behaviour and performance of a real-life process, or system.
The household simulation model shows that if everyone switched to longer life milk, this could drastically reduce milk waste in the home - to the scale of up to 150,000 tonnes per year! This represents a large carbon footprint reduction as well.

This is an outcome of the NERC innovation placement

The availability of a baseline ahead of any shale gas development is extremely important as demonstrated by the problems in the US where none was established. The current (and on-going) study was recognised by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering in their jointly produced review of shale gas in the UK and identified as their number one recommendation. The recommendations in the report were also fully endorsed by the UK Government. It has also been recognised by the onshore oil and gas industry (UK Onshore Operators Group - UKOOG) in their recently published guidance on shale gas. Other organisations have also endorsed the work including Public Health England and the Environment Agency and Defra are now co-funding this work. BGS's contribution to the science and evidence base needed to safely develop shale gas is not limited to measurement of methane. Other groundwater baseline data has been collected over a number years, some in partnership with the Environment Agency and SEPA.

The increasing numbers of scientists and tourists are threatening the continent?s biodiversity through habitat destruction, chemical and sewage pollution, displacement of wildlife and particularly non-native species introductions which have been recognized as one of the major threats facing conservation in the Antarctic Treaty area. BAS scientists are central to initiating, coordinating and contributing to large-scale multinational collaborative initiatives through the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) by documenting and analysing Antarctic biodiversity data, and using this to generate policy-related advice to stakeholders. In 2012 BAS scientists provided direct input and comment on the revisions to the Antarctic Act 1994, which has passed through Parliament as a Private Members Bill by Neil Carmichael, MP for Stroud as the Antarctic Bill (2012/13). Particular input was given regarding the revisions to the Act concerning permitting, conservation of animals and plants and Annex XI of the Environmental Protocol (Liability arising from environmental emergencies). In addition, BAS scientists provided expert input into the Overseas Territories White Paper (2012) which highlights the environmental protection of the BAT, including marine and terrestrial protected areas, non-native species management and tourism management through the production of guidelines.",,"r-3909171208.6546962561fd6","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=r-3909171208.6546962561fd6&grantRef=bas0100025","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=bas0100025","E1492D9D-BCA3-4105-ACD0-72CE117E5F86","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","21CFC584-0BCD-450C-B2C1-EFF574194DBF","1FBC001E-1A16-4CC8-8BCD-33485DB72BA2"

It is intended to help people understand the scale of possible change and inform decisions about the way that water is managed. It is a multi-layered resource providing high-level statements on water-related climate change impacts and the confidence we have in these statements. The report cards have been designed to be particularly useful for policy advisors, ministers, local authorities and any other decision-maker at any level of society and in any organisation. The information contained in the cards and in the ten supporting science evidence papers will also contribute to the UK's next Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA). BGS groundwater scientists contributed to the summary report card and authored two of the ten science evidence papers that underpin it: one paper on the historic evidence for the impact of climate change on groundwater levels, temperature and quality, and one on future impacts of climate change on groundwater levels.

VTCT are currently drawing on our findings and resources to provide learners with a qualification certificate that has a sustainability kitemark for those who have achieved an NVQ qualification in hair or beauty. Since 2015 VTCT now also insist that learners studying for an NVQ have to demonstrate sustainability practices as they work and achieve their qualification.

The work involved a wide cross-section of scientists, policymakers, and historical specialists. Based on a rapidly expanding body of research literature, the twin challenges of climate change and biological invasions (biosecurity) featured highly in the risks identified, along with those of poorly controlled infrastructure development and exploitation. It questions whether currently-existing Treaty systems are sufficient to address these challenges, and identifies areas where particular attention is required, in particular relating to biosecurity, human settlement and movement, and exploitation.",,"r-427941093.61985797621d9f94","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=r-427941093.61985797621d9f94&grantRef=bas0100025","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=bas0100025","E1492D9D-BCA3-4105-ACD0-72CE117E5F86","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","21CFC584-0BCD-450C-B2C1-EFF574194DBF","1FBC001E-1A16-4CC8-8BCD-33485DB72BA2"

The study will help to decide on future infrastructure provision that will work well under the demands of population and tourism growth, and of climate change-driven sea-level rise. One important area of the analysis, undertaken by the ITRC's Lena Fuldauer, will work with the waste, wastewater and energy sectors, investigating the opportunities and risks that arise from interdependencies between these sectors.

At the heart of the analysis sits the ITRC's National Infrastructure Systems Model for International Contexts (NISMOD-Int). This uses a system-of-systems approach to give Curacao's decision-makers information that will help them identify adaptable pathways for their sustainable development. NISMOD-Int uses a process whereby researchers work together with local policy-makers and experts to develop and test strategies for future infrastructure provision. This process is enabled by NISMOD-Int's data visualisation and decision support platform, developed by the ITRC's Tom Russell.

UNOPS is assisting the Government of Cura&ccedil;ao to make local infrastructure more resilient to the demands and risks that lie ahead. UNOPS is supporting data collection and local stakeholder interactions. In June 2017, UNOPS' Ciaretta Profas led a meeting that brought together over 50 people from across Cura&ccedil;ao's infrastructure sector, including local governments, infrastructure companies (waste, wastewater, transport, water and electricity), Curacao Maritime Authority, Central Bureau of Statistics, UN agencies; and local environmental NGOs and activists.

We were pleased to have the strong support of the Cura&ccedil;ao government, and were joined by Her Excellency Zita Jesus-Leito, Minister of Traffic, Transportation and Urban Planning. She opened the meeting by stressing the importance of developing a shared vision, with strategies that work with the unique nature of Curacao, and which balance economic and environmental factors: &quot;Plans for infrastructure development and restructuring should always address the impact on the environment and nature. These should never be disregarded when developing cities and neighbourhoods. This model (NISMOD-Int) allows the Ministry to apply an integrated approach when initiating an infrastructure development project&quot;. An overview of the event was broadcast on the local television network in the local language, Papiamento.

Over the coming months, members of ITRC-MISTRAL and UNOPS will be working closely with experts from Cura&ccedil;ao to finalise the fast-track analysis. It is expected that the insights derived from the analysis, alongside the knowledge creation during the process, will help to support evidence-based infrastructure development within Cura&ccedil;ao.

This partnership forms part of a larger initiative by UNOPS to facilitate the roll-out and uptake of NISMOD-Int, as part of their programme on Evidence Based Infrastructure (EBI). Further applications of NISMOD-Int are currently being explored in a range of political and geographical contexts including in post-conflict, post-disaster and developing economies, rapidly developing city-states and small island nations from South and Central America, to Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

The 1Belt 1Road Initiative is the biggest global infrastructure project ever attempted. The Belt and Road Initiative is geographically structured along several land corridors, and the maritime silk road. Infrastructure corridors encompassing around 60 countries, primarily in Asia and Europe but also including Oceania and East Africa, will cost an estimated US$4-8 trillion.[19][20] For more information https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative

Conceptual impacts: This has contributed to broad farmers' (mainly in UK and US), sustainability managers' (e.g. M&amp;S, CFA members), international agency representatives' (e.g. USDA), regional stakeholders' (Mancomunidad manager, mayors, students, technicians in Guatemala, Ethiopia), understanding of the agricultural impacts on climate change, the importance of sustainable land use and management and the trade-offs between climate change mitigation, adaptation and food security. It also raised awareness about the tools available (e.g. UK, Ethiopia) to quantify the impacts of land use management and land use change on GHG emissions and crop yields. Communities of learning have been created which are now reproducing the method at the local and regional levels (e.g. PhD students and researchers in Ethiopia).
Capacity building impacts: Training students, researchers, technicians and farmers was undertaken in UK, Ethiopia and Guatemala (women included). Individual and group reflections on experience, e-mails sent and uptake of methods learned confirmed that effective learning has occurred. 
Attitudinal impacts: The activities increased the willingness to engage in new collaborations (E.g. Guatemala: manager Mancomunidad, mayors; Ethiopia: PhD students, researchers) with the University of Aberdeen, but also between other stakeholders (e.g. USDA and Ethiopian Universities, Ethiopian ministry of agriculture and CCAFS etc.);
Enduring connectivity impacts: Due to the NERC KE fellowship there is a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) between University of Aberdeen and M&amp;S, a long-term collaboration with CCAFS has been made possible, research proposals to GCRF NERC (on CC resilience) and T2S (Transformations to Sustainability), with DF as PI, have been submitted involving a wide range of stakeholders in Guatemala (including the Mancomunidad Nor-Oriente) in cooperation with UK universities, and with the UK and several European universities, respectively.

I submitted the final versions of these resources to TfL for internal review in July 2019 and, following very positive feedback, was invited to present them to representatives of the 31 London Boroughs (and the City of London) at an Urban Design London event on 30th January 2020, 'Improving London's Air Quality'.

Following a further meeting with TfL on 5th March 2020, I have been granted permission to share these resources with appropriate academics at further UK institutes; I suggested that independent, expert peer review would be valuable before we make the resources publicly available.

NB The intention from the start was to develop resources suitable for further regional transport-delivery bodies in combined-authority structures, such as Transport for Greater Manchester under the auspices of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. Their influence will thereby be national in extent.

Meanwhile, TfL has integrated the resources (or references thereto) into its operational Environmental Evaluation Tool - applied to all schemes up to one hectare in size - and is in the process of integrating them into its Health Streets approach.",,"5e629b3216d164.77359132","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5e629b3216d164.77359132&grantRef=NE%2FS00940X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/S00940X/1","91A686C6-6C8C-4C5E-B9F4-59F45E552AC4","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","268A3E50-DD05-4AB1-A5B8-11C0032E3CA0"

With the potential for waste produced by the community and the absence of specific public policies for recyclable waste, the cooperative took its first steps towards its structuring in 2020. The mapping activities of the project involved two residents who acquired new skills and put them to use to establish a new social enterprise (cooperative). The recycling cooperative has made profit in the last six months. With one of the residents as the president, more than 1.5 tons of waste were recycled in March 2022, and the cooperative now employs three people in a self-sustainable way. The maintenance of the cooperative in Prevent&oacute;rio is related to four Sustainable Development Goals: 6. Drinking water and sanitation; 10. Reduction of inequalities; Sustainable cities and communities; Responsible consumption and production. The management of recyclable solid waste in the community promotes the reduction of water contamination, the use of new resources and the negative environmental impacts related to the improper disposal of waste.
The co-creation of the Prevent&oacute;rio base map also made possible to create (along with funding from Favela Inova) a community social enterprise startup - Prev&ecirc;Lab: ateli&ecirc; de Tecnologias (technology atelier) - which, in turn, provides pedagogical support for the M&atilde;es &agrave; Obra (Mothers at Work) Project to empower the women community leaders.",,"61f2ba14af3795.34631022","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=61f2ba14af3795.34631022&grantRef=ES%2FT003294%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/T003294/1","9C940177-E555-48DF-AD33-8D37E14D5E75","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","B6FB652A-60C3-48DD-9A33-075D1F759B48","6ADEB6BF-A720-4CE6-9224-17F38A40BED9"

RE: Grant numbers EP/P004180/1 and EP/P004210/1

I first met Dr Vilcan at the National Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) Conference in Birmingham on 1 May 2019, where he sought me out as a point of contact to help him in his research into the effects of government policy on the uptake of SuDS in England and Wales, following the making of Flood and Water Management Act 2010. We spoke about the progress of his research in England and how we might be of mutual benefit in terms of his Welsh research. This was later followed up by an email to me from Martin Buckle, Chair of Wales' Flood and Coastal Erosion Committee, which referenced the work of the Urban Flood Resilience Research Programme (of which Martin is a member of the Strategic Advisory Board) to establish formal contact. 

Dr Vilcan expressed a particular interest in the differences in SuDS uptake between England and Wales, following Wales' commencement of Schedule 3 to the Flood and Water Management Act. We quickly established that as the legislation had only taken effect in January 2019, it was too early to be able to tell what different effects the policy and legislation might have in Wales as compared with England. We therefore suggested an exploration of how implementation was progressing, seeking to understand what challenges and barriers remained to enabling the effective delivery of the policy goal of increased delivery of SuDs on new developments (and the other published policy goals that derive from this) and to suggest possible solutions to the issues identified.

We arranged for Dr Vilcan to attend several meetings of the SuDS Implementation Group, a group chaired by the Welsh Government, whose goal is to facilitate the successful implementation of the SuDS policy through its membership. The group comprises representatives from each of the SuDS Approving Bodies (SABs) based in each of the 22 Local Authorities across Wales alongside water and sewerage undertakers, Natural Resources Wales, the Home Builders Federation, the Federation of Master Builders, CIWEM, the Consumer Council For Water, Community Housing Cymru, the Welsh Local Government Association and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. 

At the first meeting Dr Vilcan attended he gave a presentation providing an overview of his research and seeking the views of those assembled about participating. This was premised on the basis that the goals of the research aligned with those of the group and would facilitate work it would in any case have to take forward as part of its programme. In particular it was felt that Dr Vilcan's research would help to contribute robust views and evidence towards the formal review of the implementation of the policy and legislation, to which the Welsh Government is committed at the end of the first two years.

Following a positive reception, Dr Vilcan undertook interviews with volunteer lead officers working in the SABs of several local authorities. This was followed up with a workshop, utilising the members of the SuDS Implementation Group, followed up by an interim presentation and debate of the initial findings which were later subject to an online survey, designed by Dr Vilcan. The transcribed notes of workshops, interviews and findings from the survey all fed into the final report. Throughout the design of all these processes (the workshop, the survey and latterly the drafting of the final report) Dr Vilcan remained in close contact. He was open and willing to our feedback and expertise in this area so that we were able to guide him through areas where clarity or specific expertise may expectedly have been lacking and offer editorial advice where it was appropriate.

We think the exercise was of particular benefit in helping the group, and the SABs in particular, to arrive at a consensual picture of challenges to delivery and to identify possible approaches to solutions. It was particularly useful to have someone who was able to lend academic rigour and credibility to the process. It is also relevant to mention that, owing to the time and resource pressures on the members of the group, including the Welsh Government secretariat, if Dr Vilcan had not offered his services to the group then it would most likely have been unable to carry out any desirable similar exercise in the timely manner he made possible.

As implied earlier, we intend to use the report as a touchstone for further discussion (by the SuDS Implementation Group) of the challenges the report identifies on behalf of the SABs and what progress they are able to make against the suggested areas of focus. As this is not an official report of the Welsh Government we do not make any claims for or against the positions it puts forward; while we do not expect the report to be made confidential we would expect its circulation to be limited to those who have a specific professional interest, specifically in civils, drainage, associated areas of research and policy development. 

The value of the exercise undertaken by Dr Vilcan, both throughout the various processes that led to the creation of the report and the report as a product, are expected to have an impact on the strategic direction and future workload of the SuDS Implementation Group with the potential to influence future policy and legislative decisions that might be taken following the two year review. It is understood that Martin Buckle also has an interest in the findings of the final report in his role as Chair of the Flood and Coastal Erosion Committee.

Furthermore, a similar approach is needed for the management and maintenance of existing infrastructure systems, which provide the context from which the NGI needs to grow; i.e., we need to develop and complement and/or progressively replace our existing infrastructure systems. This year's ISNGI will bring together the best and sharpest minds from industry, government and academia to help commence this co-ordinated global infrastructure research program, focussed on long term infrastructure and land use planning, and to create not only best practice benchmarks but new knowledge to better inform strategies for long term prosperity.

? Outputs &amp; outcomes: System-of-systems infrastructure modelling to support national sustainable development outcomes, International Symposia for Next Generation Infrastructure (ISNGI) (11/09/2017 to 13/09/2017)

Abstract:
Infrastructures such as energy, water, transportation, waste and digital communications system provide services that underpin many of societies critical functions. Given their importance, evidence-based infrastructure development provides an opportunity to establish adaptable pathways to sustainable development. One major barrier to realising this opportunity is the current lack of data, methodology and tools, developed specifically to support decision-makers in this task. We address this need through the development of the first-of-its-kind National Infrastructure Systems Model (NISMOD) for International contexts. At the heart of NISMOD is an assessment process that has been designed to facilitate a systematic analysis of infrastructures to support national sustainable development outcomes. These outcomes are explicitly highlighted in the visualisation platform using, amongst others, performance metrics related to the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals, which have been calculated using system-of-systems infrastructure models. The visualisation platform has been specifically designed to step infrastructure decision makers through the assessment process, highlighting key information and insights and facilitating the iterative exploration and characterisation of adaptable pathways. We demonstrate the flexibility of applying NISMOD, to a range of different countries and contexts, by presenting a number of ongoing case studies. These include Palestine, Curacao and Syria, where the process and platform are being deployed, in collaboration with a range of organisations, to derive important new evidence and the opportunity to achieve measurable sustainable development.

These activities have had a broad range of outcomes including improved knowledge and understanding of the breadth, depth and quality of UK academic work on CCS among UK policy-makers. This activity also ensured that emerging findings from the academic community were available in a timely way to policy-makers.

The Centre regularly receives requests to provide consultation responses or to contribute to document/strategy preparation by stakeholders. The Centre's Coordination Group decides how such requests will be handled: the Centre either passes such requests to Centre members to respond in a personal capacity, or asks Centre members to provide comment to the Centre so that it can submit a corporate response. In the latter case members are asked to confirm in writing that they agree with the content of the Centre's response before it is formally submitted. The UKCCSRC and its members have contributed to the development of all UK national research roadmaps for CCS, by responding to consultations and as members of working groups etc.

The below lists UKCCSRC policy inputs - activities of particular note are reported elsewhere in this submission in fuller detail.

Over 830 cities disclosed their climate data through CDP in 2020 and in order to score an A rating a city must have a city-wide emissions inventory, have set an emissions reduction target, published a climate action plan and have completed a climate adaptation plan to demonstrate how it will tackle climate hazards now and in the future.","https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/our-city/climate-change-newcastle/net-zero-newcastle-2030-action-plan","5e6929263d6082.00037088","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5e6929263d6082.00037088&grantRef=NE%2FK00896X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K00896X/1","950D026E-6515-4AD1-812E-AB2E717F65B7","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","E89C3602-0FB4-4044-A918-58966B8A10B2","889D35C5-6AF3-49AA-8D86-40865D5549AA"

RE: Grant numbers EP/P004180/1 and EP/P004210/1

I first met Dr Vilcan at the National Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) Conference in Birmingham on 1 May 2019, where he sought me out as a point of contact to help him in his research into the effects of government policy on the uptake of SuDS in England and Wales, following the making of Flood and Water Management Act 2010. We spoke about the progress of his research in England and how we might be of mutual benefit in terms of his Welsh research. This was later followed up by an email to me from Martin Buckle, Chair of Wales' Flood and Coastal Erosion Committee, which referenced the work of the Urban Flood Resilience Research Programme (of which Martin is a member of the Strategic Advisory Board) to establish formal contact. 

Dr Vilcan expressed a particular interest in the differences in SuDS uptake between England and Wales, following Wales' commencement of Schedule 3 to the Flood and Water Management Act. We quickly established that as the legislation had only taken effect in January 2019, it was too early to be able to tell what different effects the policy and legislation might have in Wales as compared with England. We therefore suggested an exploration of how implementation was progressing, seeking to understand what challenges and barriers remained to enabling the effective delivery of the policy goal of increased delivery of SuDs on new developments (and the other published policy goals that derive from this) and to suggest possible solutions to the issues identified.

We arranged for Dr Vilcan to attend several meetings of the SuDS Implementation Group, a group chaired by the Welsh Government, whose goal is to facilitate the successful implementation of the SuDS policy through its membership. The group comprises representatives from each of the SuDS Approving Bodies (SABs) based in each of the 22 Local Authorities across Wales alongside water and sewerage undertakers, Natural Resources Wales, the Home Builders Federation, the Federation of Master Builders, CIWEM, the Consumer Council For Water, Community Housing Cymru, the Welsh Local Government Association and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. 

At the first meeting Dr Vilcan attended he gave a presentation providing an overview of his research and seeking the views of those assembled about participating. This was premised on the basis that the goals of the research aligned with those of the group and would facilitate work it would in any case have to take forward as part of its programme. In particular it was felt that Dr Vilcan's research would help to contribute robust views and evidence towards the formal review of the implementation of the policy and legislation, to which the Welsh Government is committed at the end of the first two years.

Following a positive reception, Dr Vilcan undertook interviews with volunteer lead officers working in the SABs of several local authorities. This was followed up with a workshop, utilising the members of the SuDS Implementation Group, followed up by an interim presentation and debate of the initial findings which were later subject to an online survey, designed by Dr Vilcan. The transcribed notes of workshops, interviews and findings from the survey all fed into the final report. Throughout the design of all these processes (the workshop, the survey and latterly the drafting of the final report) Dr Vilcan remained in close contact. He was open and willing to our feedback and expertise in this area so that we were able to guide him through areas where clarity or specific expertise may expectedly have been lacking and offer editorial advice where it was appropriate.

We think the exercise was of particular benefit in helping the group, and the SABs in particular, to arrive at a consensual picture of challenges to delivery and to identify possible approaches to solutions. It was particularly useful to have someone who was able to lend academic rigour and credibility to the process. It is also relevant to mention that, owing to the time and resource pressures on the members of the group, including the Welsh Government secretariat, if Dr Vilcan had not offered his services to the group then it would most likely have been unable to carry out any desirable similar exercise in the timely manner he made possible.

As implied earlier, we intend to use the report as a touchstone for further discussion (by the SuDS Implementation Group) of the challenges the report identifies on behalf of the SABs and what progress they are able to make against the suggested areas of focus. As this is not an official report of the Welsh Government we do not make any claims for or against the positions it puts forward; while we do not expect the report to be made confidential we would expect its circulation to be limited to those who have a specific professional interest, specifically in civils, drainage, associated areas of research and policy development. 

The value of the exercise undertaken by Dr Vilcan, both throughout the various processes that led to the creation of the report and the report as a product, are expected to have an impact on the strategic direction and future workload of the SuDS Implementation Group with the potential to influence future policy and legislative decisions that might be taken following the two year review. It is understood that Martin Buckle also has an interest in the findings of the final report in his role as Chair of the Flood and Coastal Erosion Committee.

•improve participants' knowledge of and access to research evidence in the topic area that the ministry/ Health Portfolio is or will be facing; 
•facilitate roundtable discussions that engage both the researchers and decision makers; 
•enable the ministry/ Health Portfolio to consult with the researchers for their knowledge and perspectives on particular questions. 

The Best Brains Exchange is an informal forum for interaction, exchange and mutual learning between researchers and decision makers in order to support and facilitate the sharing and use of information on a high priority topic.

These activities have had a broad range of outcomes including improved knowledge and understanding of the breadth, depth and quality of UK academic work on CCS among UK policy-makers. This activity also ensured that emerging findings from the academic community were available in a timely way to policy-makers.

The Centre regularly receives requests to provide consultation responses or to contribute to document/strategy preparation by stakeholders. The Centre's Coordination Group decides how such requests will be handled: the Centre either passes such requests to Centre members to respond in a personal capacity, or asks Centre members to provide comment to the Centre so that it can submit a corporate response. In the latter case members are asked to confirm in writing that they agree with the content of the Centre's response before it is formally submitted. The UKCCSRC and its members have contributed to the development of all UK national research roadmaps for CCS, by responding to consultations and as members of working groups etc.

The below lists UKCCSRC policy inputs - activities of particular note are reported elsewhere in this submission in fuller detail.

- Ongoing: engagement with the CCSA and membership of its working groups

The UKCCSRC Coordination Group members are responsible for monitoring the scientific aspects of all UKCCSRC-funded activities in their respective specialisations. 

The Coordination Group members and Research Area Champions also undertake individual policy engagement, through which they ensure academic input to policy and UKCCSRC involvement as relevant. Activities through which CG and RAC engage with policy include:

- Individual contributions to consultations and reports
- Membership of advisory groups including the CCS Development Forum (the UK Government's Policy Advisory group), the DECC Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), the European Commission's Zero Emission Power (ZEP) technology platform Task Forces on Public Communications and Industrial CCS, the Thermal Generation and CCS Industry Leadership Group in Scotland, and the Engineering Policy Group Scotland
- Organisation of briefings and visits for Ministers, civil servants, the EU Parliament, and Research Councils
- Participation in standards committees related to CCS
- Attending and speaking at policy-focused meetings (including the EU2030 Energy Union and Carbon Capture Journal meeting &quot;Keeping CCS Moving&quot;, February 2015; the EU Energy Challenge summit, Brussels, November 2014; Westminster Energy, Environment and Transport Forum's event, Next Steps for CCS in the UK, February 2014; Scottish Enterprise - CCS Hub Scotland facilitated workshop, September 2012).",,"58b6fd156f0789.80929304","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=58b6fd156f0789.80929304&grantRef=EP%2FK000446%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/2","209A1667-A0A9-4BD2-AE81-D18E6DEEF424","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4"

In 2013 the UN International Labour Organization (ILO) - the UN Specialist Agency responsible for international law and policy on working life - identified as an Area of Critical Importance the elimination of Unacceptable Forms of Work (UFW) (&quot;in conditions that deny fundamental principles and rights, put at risk the lives, health, freedom, human dignity and security of workers or keep households in conditions of extreme poverty.&quot;) (ILO Towards the ILO Centenary (2013), The Director-General's Programme and Budget Proposals for 2014-15 (2013).

Recognising that there was no comprehensive understanding of UFW or how to address it, the ILO asked McCann for guidance. She co-authored a policy report (Fudge and McCann, Unacceptable Forms of Work (ILO 2015), was advisor to the two units that lead the ILO's efforts on eliminating UFW - the Conditions of Work and Equality Department (e.g. submission to the ILO Governing Body (executive) discussion of UFW ) (ILO Area of Critical Importance: Protecting Workers from Unacceptable Forms of Work (2015) and Employment Policy Department - and briefed the ILO Director-General (July 2017). 

Through these channels research, has been incorporated into four flagship ILO policy agendas on the SDGs, the Universal Labour Guarantee, precarious work, and national employment policy. Its particular influence is in outlining (1) the dimensions of UFW; (2) a strategy for local actors to determine intervention priorities; and (3) a strategic regulation approach. As confirmed by Dr Sangheon Lee, Director of the ILO's Employment Policy Department, the ILO has &quot;benefitted greatly&quot; from the research.

This research is central to the ILO's work as the lead UN agency responsible for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals: it has been incorporated through the inclusion of UFW in the ILO's platform for achieving the SDGs ILO Decent Work and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 

The research has also had a crucial influence on ILO interventions on UFW in Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, India, Malawi, Morocco, Pakistan, Pacific Island countries, southern Africa, Thailand and Uzbekistan, as attested by Manuela Tomei, Director of the Conditions of Work and Equality Department, the unit that leads this area of the Organization's work; employment policy in China, Indonesia, Mozambique, the Philippines, South Africa, and Uganda and discussions with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and OECD.",,"5d5d8978842973.32906395","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5d5d8978842973.32906395&grantRef=ES%2FP007465%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/P007465/1","C631CAC4-A934-4577-9FF3-12F7B16C3318","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","46B41008-0EB4-4E28-BBFB-E98366999EC5","A4BB3E13-7DFE-4869-9C34-DE0DC2D2B449"

Progress on gender balance has been too slow for too long. There is a welcome renewed focus on equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) as UK Research and Innovation becomes established, and we need to ensure that this opportunity is fully seized upon.

It is located in Magdalena Valley which hosts a high number of endemic species of fauna and flora. This includes 276 endemic vascular plant species (Bernal et al., 2016), 7 endemic bird species (Proves, 2017), and 14 endemic amphibians (Ovalle-Pacheco et al., 2019). Forests in the Magdalena Valley and Las Quinchas have also been historically connected to other areas of rainforest in Colombia like the Choc&oacute; and Catatumbo (Serrano et al., 2021). This means that degradation in Las Quinchas could also impact other areas of forest in the country and emphasizes the urgency of preventing further biodiversity loss. 

Due to the ecological importance of Las Quinchas, part of its territory was declared by the Colombian government as a Regional Natural Park in 2008. However, so far, the application of conservation policies has generated more uncertainties than solutions and new forms of dispossession are pushing peasants out of the park, excluded from policy decisions and passively displaced since there are no livelihood alternatives, clarity on the titling of lands within the park and also on the permitted uses in this new area of environmental conservation. 

Environmental problems in the Serrania de las Quinchas go up to when the Texaco oil enclave was formed in the 1940s, followed by the takeover of this territory by illegal paramilitary groups that exacerbated environmental degradation through illicit drug economies trafficking, logging and the expansion of pastures for livestock (Amador-Jim&eacute;nez, et al., 2020; 2021). However, although these events are sequential in time, none have been resolved, and all continue affecting the Quinchas simultaneously in the present. 

The case of the Serrania de las Quinchas is significant in Colombia, and Latin America concerning socio-environmental conflicts since what is at stake is the political decision between promoting extractivist or environmental conservation and how to do it in times of climate change. However, in the audience, what was evidenced is the importance of rebuilding credibility and dialogue between environmental authorities and the communities of Las Quinchas, since the way to develop inclusive environmental governance is trust and mutual credibility based on concrete activities and joint decision-making.

The BioResilience researchers are committed to communicating the science we produce and establishing a dialogue with communities and environmental institutions operating in our research sites. We expect that our studies could contribute to influencing rigorous policy decisions for the conservation of the forest and the improvements in the quality of life of the forest communities. Our research group will continue to accompany these meetings and participate in planning and decision-making activities on environmental governance in the Serrania de las Quinchas as a transdisciplinary perspective fundamental for resolving the socio-environmental conflicts that unfold from the territory.","https://twitter.com/senadogovco/status/1383159779879714819","62016c7f419261.17716893","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=62016c7f419261.17716893&grantRef=NE%2FR017980%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/R017980/1","02F48C14-A805-4FED-BB2D-ADFCA0C5080D","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","A0DC31FF-CA3F-43D7-A947-852655BA22B7"

The objectives of the Best Brains Exchange program are to:
•provide the ministry/ Health Portfolio with an overview of the latest evidence from researchers on the basis of their expertise and knowledge on critical issues related to the ministry/ Health Portfolio identified topic; 
•improve participants' knowledge of and access to research evidence in the topic area that the ministry/ Health Portfolio is or will be facing; 
•facilitate roundtable discussions that engage both the researchers and decision makers; 
•enable the ministry/ Health Portfolio to consult with the researchers for their knowledge and perspectives on particular questions. 

The Best Brains Exchange is an informal forum for interaction, exchange and mutual learning between researchers and decision makers in order to support and facilitate the sharing and use of information on a high priority topic.

Unlike other CIHR programs, this is not an open funding opportunity. Best Brains Exchanges are planned based on the identified needs and timelines of the provincial/ territorial ministries and Health Portfolio. CIHR approaches experts to participate in Best Brains Exchanges, as appropriate, based on &quot;fit&quot; with the topic of the session.","http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/43978.html","5c879639d1ef91.83275820","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5c879639d1ef91.83275820&grantRef=MR%2FL01341X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/L01341X/1","ACB0D5C4-7CA4-4EBA-91FB-948BC9697113","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","D966BB61-3D36-4457-A5A8-2DE10449224D"

This includes the provision of an efficient, safe and resilient estate that supports both clinical services and improves the experience that patients have of their care and treatment. It should be a public sector exemplar for the implementation of Climate Change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

The NHS estate has an important contribution to make in reducing running costs and delivering savings for investment in frontline patient care. These must be undertaken to meet the challenges of funding the NHS in the future and will form part of the government's drive to increase the efficiency of the public sector estate in parallel with the dual challenges of an ageing population and Climate Change. A significant step change in the way this estate is managed has to be achieved.

The opportunities for the NHS to achieve efficiency savings and reduced running costs in the estate are considerable. These efficiencies need to be driven by: 
• more efficient plus effective running and use of the estate; 
• improved efficiency, including value for money, in capital procurement and construction;
• improved energy efficiency and associated carbon reduction.
Building energy use (gas and electricity) is 18% of the NHS England carbon footprint at a metered energy cost of &pound;636 million .This cost equates to approximately 9% of the total estates budget of &pound;7bn.
In 2013/14 the Department's NHS Energy Efficiency Fund (NHS EEF) of &pound;49.3M was allocated to 117 energy efficiency projects across 48 NHS organisations in England. The Fund enabled the NHS to go further, faster in mitigating the effects of climate change, by improving energy efficiency, whilst retaining the resulting benefits within the NHS organisations for re-investment directly into frontline patient services. The lessons learnt from these energy efficiency projects are embedded in Encode 2015 as best practice guidance.
The current NHS Estates Efficiency programme has the challenge of reducing the current estates budget as part of the contribution to help ensure the continued delivery of a sustainable NHS. Improving energy efficiency of the NHS estate will deliver a contribution to this important initiative whilst also assisting the NHS to meet the necessary reductions in carbon emissions of 34% compared to 1990 levels by 2020.","https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-energy-work-in-healthcare-htm-07-02","56d710653344c8.69065208","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=56d710653344c8.69065208&grantRef=EP%2FG061327%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/G061327/1","5E9E3502-0C51-4024-AFC6-E0B01C924C20","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","4B5E71F8-B524-4DD2-82B6-CE7B3B2167EF"

They also affect, forest and fibre systems, natural ecosystems, biodiversity and environmental harmony, and impede trade and market access. And, phytopathology research has also been a central focus for discovery and development in biotechnology and plant-microbial molecular biology. For our profession - people are the pivotal element, and while in the coming years, the ISPP will maintain a focus on plant disease impacts on food security, it should and will also foster attention to all facets of our profession through our Congresses, subject matter committees and our website, newsletter and Journal. In this light, the ISPP taskforce on global food security which has more than achieved it objectives will now become a Commission working in the same way as other ISPP Subject Matter Committees. https://www.isppweb.org/newsletters/pdf/48_8.pdf

One of the major outcomes was the proposal for a code of ethics for plant health emergencies:

* to foster ethical conduct
* to support communication and collaboration
* to ensure that decisions are based on the best available evidence

The UN OCHA included the information in their daily situation reports, which are read by humanitarians and governments worldwide. The work helped in humanitarian decision-making and response in Mozambique and feedback is that the information was invaluable in responding to these disasters.

It showcases how flexibility can be introduced in the fisheries management cycle in order to foster adaptation, strengthen the resilience of fisheries, reduce their vulnerability to climate change, and enable managers to respond in a timely manner to the projected changes in the dynamics of marine resources and ecosystems. The publication includes a set of good practices for climate-adaptive fisheries management that have proven their effectiveness and can be adapted to different contexts, providing a range of options for stakeholders including the fishing industry, fishery managers, policymakers and others involved in decision-making. These good practices were linked to one or more of the three common climate-related impacts on fisheries resources: distributional change; productivity change; and species composition change. Therefore, these three impacts can serve as practical entry points to guide decision-makers in identifying good practice adaptation measures suitable for their local contexts. These good practices are based upon transferable experiences and lessons learned from the thirteen case studies across the globe and hopefully will contribute to greater uptake and implementation of climate-adaptive fisheries management measures on the ground.

The Commission also helped recruit Champions who engaged with the public at stalls at 80 events.

The aim of this training is to help urban designers analyse the resiliency of their sustainability solutions - the things they are doing today in the name of sustainability, such as incorporating greywater recycling into a housing development or cycle paths across a city.

Title of Session: Urban Futures Methodology Workshop
Date: Thursday 29 November 2018 (3.30pm - 5pm)

Summary: Sustainable urban development, no matter what definition is used, is all about the future - putting in place solutions that will yield a positive legacy in cities, where most of the world's population now lives. Urban resilience is about putting in place solutions that are resistance to future uncertainties. The essential underlying question is 'how sustainable are these solutions?' while the answer inevitably is 'it depends on how the future develops'. However, predicting the future is complex - arguably, the only certainties are that there will be change, and that we must learn to live within the resource limitations of our planet. The Urban Futures Method aims to broaden the way we think about the form, function, and context of urban development and regeneration by focussing on the likely long-term performance of today's urban design solutions, and their associated vulnerabilities (see http://designingresilientcities.co.uk/).
 
In this workshop, we present and apply the Urban Futures Method to test the likely future performance of urban development and regeneration-related 'sustainability solutions' - actions taken today in the name of sustainability - in a series of possible future scenarios in the year 2050. If a proposed solution delivers a positive legacy, regardless of the future against which it is tested, then it can be adopted with confidence. The Method provides insights into the potential impacts of today's urban planning and design decisions, and challenges the conventional mainstream approach to sustainability by incorporating changing priorities and different ways of thinking into today's actions, with the intention to ensure relevance in the future.

It showcases how flexibility can be introduced in the fisheries management cycle in order to foster adaptation, strengthen the resilience of fisheries, reduce their vulnerability to climate change, and enable managers to respond in a timely manner to the projected changes in the dynamics of marine resources and ecosystems. The publication includes a set of good practices for climate-adaptive fisheries management that have proven their effectiveness and can be adapted to different contexts, providing a range of options for stakeholders including the fishing industry, fishery managers, policymakers and others involved in decision-making. These good practices were linked to one or more of the three common climate-related impacts on fisheries resources: distributional change; productivity change; and species composition change. Therefore, these three impacts can serve as practical entry points to guide decision-makers in identifying good practice adaptation measures suitable for their local contexts. These good practices are based upon transferable experiences and lessons learned from the thirteen case studies across the globe and hopefully will contribute to greater uptake and implementation of climate-adaptive fisheries management measures on the ground.

Currently, the focus, for example of IDH, is on 18 commodities. Starting point are the targets, such as
poverty reduction or environmental protection. Deforestation has been, and still is, a major theme,
crosscutting different commodities. Some sectors have more impacts than others, some sectors can
deliver more gains. It is expected that biggest gains are to be found in cocoa, tea, pulp &amp; paper, palm oil
and soy, and not in natural stone for example. Focus can enhance credibility, because chain actors
ranging from producers to consumers, need proof that a sector can be transformed. Focus is also needed
to be able to move towards and reach tipping points. It could be a task of governments to bring focus.
However, given the strong diversity of chains and commodities, it was debated whether focus is the
right means to reach overall sustainability. The diversity of perspectives was mentioned as an important
prerequisite in sustainable GVC governance, because focus could lead to tunnel vision. There was
however no support to, for example, double the amount of commodities to be addressed by standards,
though neither was there for the common notion that there is now overcertification. Especially if
spillover effects are real, overcertification is not a problem. It was noted that there is no overcertification,
but there is overassessment. The issue of premium eroding was addressed, especially if the aim is to let
producers gain from standards. What would be the incentive for small-scale producers to invest and
participate, if there is no premium? The business case is essential for producers. It was argued that there
can be other effects more important than direct economic impact, like through capacity building and
improved farming. Also, &quot;old-fashioned aid&quot; is still a way to improve farming without certification. It
was suggested that focus is not the right word, but that it is about prioritization.

2. What instruments are sufficient, is there a need for more instruments, and/or should there
be a mix of instruments?
Certification can be the trigger for innovation and improvement. It should be realized though that
certification is not just one-size-fits-all, there is a plurality of models, structures and forms. How to make
sure that sustainability standards become sustainable themselves is a challenge; it was noted that we are
still in the startup phase. Public money is especially needed in the initial phase but since sustainability
is about continual improvement, developing an exit strategy (after 2-4 years) for government support is
of utmost importance. Private partners should take it further, and make the B2B relations work.
Certification can facilitate such B2B collaboration, by bringing people together, forging relationships
and building platforms for information exchange and local support.

3. What is the relation between standards or structures on the national level, and those on
the international level, is there a need for benchmarking?
Overall, there was consensus that there is a need for benchmarking of national standards, although it
was noted that retailers work globally, so they do not support the idea of national standards.
Benchmarking can range from harmonization to equivalency, a question is what does benchmarking
need to do? According to some, it should be a spectrum and employ a stepwise approach towards
sustainability (continual improvement). Point of concern is credibility of national standards: how to
make sure that credibility principles are met or strengthened?","http://www.iob-evaluatie.nl/sites/iob-evaluatie.nl/files/Chains%20for%20Change%20workshop%20report.pdf","56cc955447e1d7.09659554","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=56cc955447e1d7.09659554&grantRef=ES%2FF000448%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/F000448/1","5E95F675-D810-484A-AB73-B0663D4FA23E","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","8BA3C264-769F-487E-B61A-2D4CB6A105B6","B853A7EF-DB6F-448C-A874-90024F9F526E"

Who is coming?
From an initial proposal for Will Lord to lead a 10-strong UKRI strategy team visit to the AMRC/Nuclear AMRC, this has morphed into a proposal for some 21 members of the team to come up to Sheffield. This team includes three Deputy Directors. Kathy Magnay leads on cross research council funding; Ben Pledger has a key role in budget setting, investment and financials. He is also leading on a review of Catapults to see how they can help 'level up' the UK economy.

What they are interested in?
Will's group is on a fact/ideas finding mission to help UKRI shape their proposals for the March
Budget, and, more importantly, the longer term investment strategy that will form part of a soon-to-be
announced Spending Review. They are expressly interested in two related themes (the two bullet
points are their words):
1. Economic Impact: 'Understanding how to maximise the impact of science, research and innovation on productivity and growth. This could include the impact AMRC's work has both on businesses through developing new technologies and the wider Sheffield city-region (Dave Smith's insight would be useful there)'.
2. Net Zero: 'The commitment to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 is an increasingly big priority for UKRI. It would be great to see the great work businesses and researchers are doing at AMRC around clean energy, sustainable manufacturing etc. thatcould contribute to that'.

Who are they are they and what influence do they have?
Will reports directly to the Executive Director of Strategy, Isobel Stephen, who has expressed great interest in her team coming to see us. Isobel reports to Sir Mark Walport. https://bit.ly/2SnNc9a It should be noted that, before joining UKRI, she was Housing Director at HCLG and the Department's overall lead on housing strategy including the delivery of a number of multi billion pound market side housing supply programmes, including Help to Buy Equity Loan; the Home Building Fund and the housing guarantees schemes. For those of us interested in MMC, she was at a meeting last year with Laing O'Rourke headlined -- Housing market at offsite 'tipping point', says London housing boss. https://bit.ly/3bF8g2G

This is the team's first big visit and it's significant they have chosen us. Since Will's visit last year, he says the profile of, and interest in the AMRC, has grown significantly in Whitehall. Ben Pledger is Deputy Director local growth investment at BEIS. Linkedin profile found here: https://bit.ly/39Oaf2T. Understand his team also reviewing Catapult to see how they can 'level up' the economy using R&amp;D spend as per Richard Jones's work in this area. Ben studied Maths at Lancaster University. Graduated in 2002. Entered civil service and became Private Secretary to Lord Heseltine. Was involved in the No stone unturned report https://bit.ly/2SXKO7V which is interesting in the light of
current concentration of power in the hands of the PM, with striking parallels about a number ten led quest for growth. No surprise that Hezza turned up recently in the FT https://on.ft.com/32gHyZX. The former Deputy PM wrote: 'Word has reached me that Boris Johnson, the prime minister, has described himself as a &quot;Brexity Hezza&quot;. Ben sits in the team under Simon Ridley, the DG for Decentralisation and Growth - so this has responsibility for Devo Deals and Mayors ( DD Mike Wiltshire leads on this).
Kathy Magnay Deputy Director at EPSR. She works primarily on cross-council interfaces with oversight of EPSRC's Infrastructure and Connected Nation delivery plan priorities. Kathryn has a particular focus on Artificial Intelligence, working across UKRI and with external stakeholders to develop an AI research strategy. She has also worked closely with Jacqui Murray, a friend of the AMRC, on the Faraday Challenge and batteries. They were co-interim directors of Faraday. https://bit.ly/2SWeRgh. She was for a while Head of Energy and EPSRC. Her report EPSRC - Research Funding Landscape, can be found here: https://www.nuclearuniversities.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/PDFs/2016Presentations/NADM2016_Magnay_EPSRC.pdf Strong focus on fusion. David Rogers Deputy Director Investment Strategy UKRI. Until recently David worked in the private sector as Director of Policy at Deloitte. Investment Committee provides expertise, advice and assurance on major investment decisions, including assessment of business cases and the oversight of the portfolio of major projects across the organisation, chaired by the Chief Finance Officer.Before that David he was as a senior official in the BIS, where he advised Ministers on a range of policy areas, including financial services, business finance, tax, business investment and economic growth.
He trained as an economist, before joining HM Treasury over a decade ago, later moving to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. David also has experience of the business world, as a Director of a small manufacturing business in the East of England where he was responsible for sales, exports and business development.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has recently approved a byelaw to protect 117 square miles (304 square kilometres) of coastal seabed to allow for the regeneration of underwater seaweed forests. The ban, first agreed by the Sussex Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (IFCA) in January 2021, is the first fisheries byelaw to be based on an impact assessment of the natural capital, an approach adapted by the IFCA from SWEEP research.

The new measures reflect an ecosystem approach toward fisheries management, recognising the importance of healthy marine habitats in supporting long term healthy commercial and recreational fisheries. The natural capital based methodologies used by Sussex IFCA to support the need for the trawling restrictions were first developed as part of SWEEP's work with the North Devon Marine Pioneer.

The resulting Impact Assessment made multiple references to University of Plymouth's Lyme Bay research as well as SWEEP reports, which specifically informed the assessment of goods and services from the seabed habitats and what these mean for food provision, climate regulation, flood and sea defence, clean water and sediments and tourism and recreation.

The potential for ecosystems to renew and recover when trawling is removed from the seabed is based firmly on the evidence generated from the University of Plymouth's research in Lyme Bay that demonstrates that such management measures enables species recovery, and also enables social and economic benefits.

Trawling is now prohibited throughout the year over large areas along the entire Sussex coast closest to the shore. The new measures allow essential habitats, such as kelp forests, to regenerate. It is hoped the protected area will enhance important fish feeding, breeding and nursery grounds, and improvements in biodiversity and carbon storage are expected.

Furthermore, the results of the North Devon Marine Pioneer provided suggestions for assessing the condition of natural capital assets which could be adapted for use in Sussex. These focus on the condition of habitats to produce ecosystem services and the understanding that a reduction in pressures, such as fishing, can increase the ecological and social value they provide. Largely based on SWEEP research, the Sussex IFCA proposed an ecosystem-based management approach to support the sustainable management of marine resources, noting that the provision of ecosystem service benefits is linked to the contribution of the range of habitats present.","https://www.sussex-ifca.gov.uk/nearshore-trawling-byelaw","6222299e97a660.30981177","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=6222299e97a660.30981177&grantRef=NE%2FP011217%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/P011217/1","C0E5F4D5-3EF9-4503-B7FC-0616914F4C30","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","8273D834-5632-484D-AAD3-63830314AE7B"

UN high level meeting - the next level below their general Assembly - about infrastructure serving women and girls. (16/10/2018)","Participation in a advisory committee",,"Multiple continents/international","Second Committee, Side Event: Infrastructure and sustainable development - Making infrastructure investments work for women and girls (General Assembly, 73rd session).

? Outputs &amp; outcomes:
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has reinforced the recognition that infrastructure forms the backbone of modern societies and that inadequate access to infrastructure and its services prevents the realization of human rights, perpetuates inequality, and hampers progress towards environmental sustainability. Furthermore, we have overwhelming evidence to show how the absence of adequate infrastructure disproportionately affects the most disadvantaged,
especially women and girls.

A recent study by the G20's Global Infrastructure Hub has shown that there is a current infrastructure investment gap of USD 97 trillion to meet global needs by 2040. The need to invest in infrastructure and provide scalable solutions is evident, but how can they be financed, particularly in low-income countries where the gaps are greatest and the capacity of most households to pay user charges lowest? 

UN-Women and UNOPS have co-organized this side event bringing together a group of leading experts to explore some of the key policy choices facing countries as they seek to address gaps in their capacity to effectively plan, deliver, and manage sustainable, resilient, inclusive, and gender-responsive infrastructure. 

Prof Hall particularly outlined the importance of digital infrastructure and gender imbalance across infrastructure issues and planning and encouraged further discussion of this element. He also emphasized the importance of infrastructure's role within the SDGs. He raised awareness of the NISMod-Int infrastructure modelling wich is running in various places worldwide, including smaller states such a St Lucia and Cura&ccedil;ao.

Mr Richard Kozul-Wright thanked the panel for it's input which has broadened the panel's viewpoint across the issue of gender imbalance. These points will go towards changing the UN's policies. 

During the responses Prof Hall spoke to caution in allowing infrastructure to be state led, and into suffering continuing due to a lack of finance in poorer countries.

We have found that flow is dependent on stress acting upon the fracture, shear stress along the fracture, fracture topology/roughness, mineralogy, geochemistry of the pore fluid and shear displacement along the fracture. Fractures often act as conduits of enhanced flow within the ground and may be responsible for the transport of radionuclides away from a geological disposal facility for radioactive waste, flow of groundwater within a fractured rock, leakage path of CO2 from a carbon capture and storage facility, and/ or the release of natural gas during hydraulic fracturing of shale formations. The process understanding and data generated by this experimental programme are being actively utilised in the evidence-base for safety case development by UK and European radioactive waste management organisations, as well as CCS regulators and potential operators in the UK and Europe, together with academic researchers on unconventional hydrocarbons.",,"54511175416339.83866892","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=54511175416339.83866892&grantRef=bgs05010","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=bgs05010","28CE20CA-8470-4B50-A31A-627071F33F3C","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","7ADE0AB2-1050-4241-987D-F3B1C3322E05","41E8B70F-403B-4DAF-904A-0AE70E462725"

This report provides the most up-to-date information on the disaggregated impacts of climate change for marine and inland fisheries, and aquaculture, in the context of poverty alleviation and the differential dependency of countries on fish and fishery resources. The work is based on model projections, data analyses, as well as national, regional and basin-scale expert assessments.

The inclusion of adaptation measures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector is currently hampered by a widespread lack of targeted analyses of the sector's vulnerabilities to climate change and associated risks, as well as the opportunities and responses available. This report provides the most up-to-date information on the disaggregated impacts of climate change for marine and inland fisheries, and aquaculture, in the context of poverty alleviation and the differential dependency of countries on fish and fishery resources. The work is based on model projections, data analyses, as well as national, regional and basin-scale expert assessments. The results indicate that climate change will lead to significant changes in the availability and trade of fish products, with potentially important geopolitical and economic consequences, especially for those countries most dependent on the sector.","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I9705EN","604245ea73f3c3.78942329","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=604245ea73f3c3.78942329&grantRef=NE%2FM00693X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M00693X/1","B5F089F0-103F-4460-BA01-1B7A031C9624","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","813F6E5A-7C55-44B1-BC26-C77FF12DBD2C"

(11/03/2019 to 15/03/2019)","Participation in a advisory committee",,"Multiple continents/international","? Outputs &amp; outcomes:
The resolution points to the centrality of infrastructure to the SDGs and the broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Among other things, it calls upon Member States to strengthen national and regional systems-level strategic approaches to infrastructure planning and requests that UN Environment, its partners, and other stakeholders support Member States' efforts. It also requests that UN Environment prepare a compilation report for the next UNEA of relevant best practices and knowledge gaps, and asks that Member States share such information with each other.
Rowan Palmer (Programme Specialist, Economic and Fiscal Policy Unit, Economy Division, South-South Cooperation Unit, Policy and Programme Division) states &quot;This resolution provides a strong mandate to continue our work.&quot;, referring to the UN Environment Sustainable Infrastructure partnership (26/02/2019) which recognises the work of the ITRC.

The inclusion of adaptation measures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector is currently hampered by a widespread lack of targeted analyses of the sector's vulnerabilities to climate change and associated risks, as well as the opportunities and responses available. This report provides the most up-to-date information on the disaggregated impacts of climate change for marine and inland fisheries, and aquaculture, in the context of poverty alleviation and the differential dependency of countries on fish and fishery resources. The work is based on model projections, data analyses, as well as national, regional and basin-scale expert assessments. The results indicate that climate change will lead to significant changes in the availability and trade of fish products, with potentially important geopolitical and economic consequences, especially for those countries most dependent on the sector.","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I9705EN","604245ea73f3c3.78942329","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=604245ea73f3c3.78942329&grantRef=NE%2FL008750%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L008750/1","3793BD7F-091A-45D4-9111-57CCEC4F5539","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","813F6E5A-7C55-44B1-BC26-C77FF12DBD2C"

The government of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo Secretary of Agriculture (our partners) has a Community Supported Agriculture Platform, in which prices and environmental footprints can be managed, reducing food losses and waste. The ULL decision tool is part of this platform, supporting community of producers, supply chain actors and food buyers to choose the most &quot;sustainable&quot; way of food production and trade. But this is supposed to be an evolutionary process, in which a higher level of &quot;sustainable production and commercialization will rise, once this initiative has only begun in 2019. We see this new community joint decision making process as a &quot;situation arena&quot;, in which a learning process to choose more sustainable forms of agricultural practices and commercialization can evolve for a so called &quot;transition for sustainable food systems&quot;.","http://agrosp.sp.gov.br/","6034c17bbb2472.95600536","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=6034c17bbb2472.95600536&grantRef=ES%2FS002243%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/S002243/1","99E679A7-0853-471A-B753-756725C16D57","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","D60C85C3-0343-430E-81C7-B04058A4B1DF","1E20C27A-D72F-48C4-BF0D-BE5E7584E60D"

Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) cover 40 percent of the surface of the planet, or 62 percent of the total ocean surface area. Their living resources have long been utilized, whereas, in recent years, their non-living marine resources have become increasingly utilized. The ABNJ do not belong to any single State; instead, under UNCLOS, they are managed through a suite of agreements and global and regional bodies, each with its own mandate and priorities.

Evidence was published on 11 September 2013: https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/submissions-uk-parliamentary-call-evidence-inquiry-ccs-published.

In addition to the Centre submission, individual members also submitted separate responses. CG member Stuart Haszeldine was invited to follow up by giving evidence in Parliament to the committee in October 2013 (https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/prof-stuart-haszeldine-gives-evidence-ccs-parliament), and Director Jon Gibbins and CG member David Reiner were invited to follow up by giving evidence to the Committee in a session in Sheffield in January 2014. During this session the Committee took evidence from CCS experts including UKCCSRC Members - a transcript of the evidence is available on the ECCC web site (http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/energy-and-climate-change-committee/carbon-capture-and-storage/oral/5618.pdf).

The Energy and Climate Change Select Committee also made a fact-finding visit to the UKCCSRC PACT facilities while in Sheffield. During their visit to PACT, the Committee participated in an introductory discussion on the equipment at PACT and its applications and then made a detailed tour of the site. 

Tim Yeo MP, Chair of the Committee, said of the day &quot;Carbon capture and storage could be a key technology helping us to decarbonise our power sector and heavy industry. There is currently a disappointing lack of progress on developing CCS. The PACT facilities are an excellent example of the types of R&amp;D projects the UK should be investing in to ensure we have a home grown low-carbon industry here in the UK. I look forward to seeing firsthand how the facilities are bridging the gap between bench-scale R&amp;D and industrial pilot scale projects accelerating the development of novel carbon capture technologies. I am sure that our experience here will help to feed into our wider work on CCS.&quot;","https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/submissions-uk-parliamentary-call-evidence-inquiry-ccs-published","5464882d8ef408.54785704","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5464882d8ef408.54785704&grantRef=EP%2FK000446%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/2","209A1667-A0A9-4BD2-AE81-D18E6DEEF424","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4"

Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) cover 40 percent of the surface of the planet, or 62 percent of the total ocean surface area. Their living resources have long been utilized, whereas, in recent years, their non-living marine resources have become increasingly utilized. The ABNJ do not belong to any single State; instead, under UNCLOS, they are managed through a suite of agreements and global and regional bodies, each with its own mandate and priorities. All nations with a &quot;real interest&quot; in the ABNJ share responsibility for the proper management and conservation of ABNJ resources and biodiversity. Despite the vast geographical extension of the ABNJ, the current understanding of their role, influence and importance to coastal waters is limited. There is increasing evidence that ABNJ and coastal waters are closely connected, and that activities in ABNJ can influence coastal zones (Popova et al., 2019).","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/ca9229en","604107513970a2.47699290","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=604107513970a2.47699290&grantRef=NE%2FR000123%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/R000123/1","7E52DFF5-E7E8-42E8-BF21-5C9181D9B0AE","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","B17B3FE8-113A-47B9-85C8-E0D3D59EFEB6"

Understanding resilience to climate change. (01/04/2016 - 28/06/2016)","Participation in a advisory committee",,"National","In April 2016 Dr Raghav Pant and Dr Scott Thacker from the Environmental Change Institute (ECI) at the School of Geography and the Environment asked the Consulting Services team at Oxford University Innovation for help with a complex collaborative project. The objective was to assess the possible impacts of climate change on interdependent systems along HS2 - the planned high-speed railway linking London, Birmingham, the East Midlands, Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester. The project was managed by JBA Consulting - a group of engineers, environmental consultants, designers and scientists who for the last 20 years have been committed to improving the natural and built environment - and alongside the ECI team also included professionals from the Met Office.

With OUI's assistance, contracts and invoicing arrangements were put in place, and the work got underway. Raghav and Scott's insights enabled the project to make practical, science-based judgements based on world-leading techniques established by the University of Oxford's Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium. Together, they led the development of a comprehensive methodology to assist civil engineers and designers in accounting for climate change interdependencies when designing the HS2 route. In particular, they developed and implemented methods for describing the interdependencies; created a risk-based approach for assessing the impact of climate change on HS2 interdependencies; and prescribed a methodology for categorising, assessing and prioritising any HS2 vulnerabilities arising from these interdependencies.

Their work established a system-of-systems approach that provides HS2 with a holistic understanding of risk attributable to other interdependent utilities such as electricity, gas, water, etc. In a nutshell, it is a comprehensive climate change risk assessment of interdependent infrastructures, which is an intrinsic part of HS2 Ltd's commitment to creating a resilient high-speed railway network.

Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) cover 40 percent of the surface of the planet, or 62 percent of the total ocean surface area. Their living resources have long been utilized, whereas, in recent years, their non-living marine resources have become increasingly utilized. The ABNJ do not belong to any single State; instead, under UNCLOS, they are managed through a suite of agreements and global and regional bodies, each with its own mandate and priorities. All nations with a &quot;real interest&quot; in the ABNJ share responsibility for the proper management and conservation of ABNJ resources and biodiversity. Despite the vast geographical extension of the ABNJ, the current understanding of their role, influence and importance to coastal waters is limited. There is increasing evidence that ABNJ and coastal waters are closely connected, and that activities in ABNJ can influence coastal zones (Popova et al., 2019).","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/ca9229en","604107513970a2.47699290","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=604107513970a2.47699290&grantRef=NE%2FM00693X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M00693X/1","B5F089F0-103F-4460-BA01-1B7A031C9624","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","813F6E5A-7C55-44B1-BC26-C77FF12DBD2C"

This is a recent trend, as until the turn of the century firms from developed economies dominated global cross-border direct investment. Because developing economies are the source of these investments, understanding the impact of such outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) on the home economies where these firms are headquartered is of great importance. OFDI can contribute to sustainable developmental outcomes, by generating home country effects which promote trade, employment, upgrading, growth and other aspects of economic development in source economies. Yet, the precise nature and characteristics of OFDI home country effects remain little understood. Moreover, even less is known about the most effective policies and measures governments can introduce to leverage OFDI for sustainable development. As a result, investment policymakers in developing countries have both a limited knowledge about the links between OFDI and home country sustainable development outcomes and remain hesitant to introduce policies to harness OFDI for sustainable development.","https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Outward_FDI_Insight_Report_2022.pdf","62307529a90101.44782908","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=62307529a90101.44782908&grantRef=ES%2FS002278%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/S002278/1","033B365F-18C9-4F54-90D9-23753E74CB4F","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","B6FB652A-60C3-48DD-9A33-075D1F759B48","DFD47E62-01FA-4AC2-BE54-2B1597CDD537"

Evidence was published on 11 September 2013: https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/submissions-uk-parliamentary-call-evidence-inquiry-ccs-published.

In addition to the Centre submission, individual members also submitted separate responses. CG member Stuart Haszeldine was invited to follow up by giving evidence in Parliament to the committee in October 2013 (https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/prof-stuart-haszeldine-gives-evidence-ccs-parliament), and Director Jon Gibbins and CG member David Reiner were invited to follow up by giving evidence to the Committee in a session in Sheffield in January 2014. During this session the Committee took evidence from CCS experts including UKCCSRC Members - a transcript of the evidence is available on the ECCC web site (http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/energy-and-climate-change-committee/carbon-capture-and-storage/oral/5618.pdf).

The Energy and Climate Change Select Committee also made a fact-finding visit to the UKCCSRC PACT facilities while in Sheffield. During their visit to PACT, the Committee participated in an introductory discussion on the equipment at PACT and its applications and then made a detailed tour of the site. 

Tim Yeo MP, Chair of the Committee, said of the day &quot;Carbon capture and storage could be a key technology helping us to decarbonise our power sector and heavy industry. There is currently a disappointing lack of progress on developing CCS. The PACT facilities are an excellent example of the types of R&amp;D projects the UK should be investing in to ensure we have a home grown low-carbon industry here in the UK. I look forward to seeing firsthand how the facilities are bridging the gap between bench-scale R&amp;D and industrial pilot scale projects accelerating the development of novel carbon capture technologies. I am sure that our experience here will help to feed into our wider work on CCS.&quot;","https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/submissions-uk-parliamentary-call-evidence-inquiry-ccs-published","5464882d8ef408.54785704","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5464882d8ef408.54785704&grantRef=EP%2FK000446%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","DAD8D8F7-42C8-4BDC-8AFA-1F77CC7433B2","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4"

Presentation of information to the Minister of Traffic, Transportation and Urban Planning, Government of Curacao (28/09/2017)","Participation in a national consultation",,"Multiple continents/international","Development of a fast-track analysis of the infrastructure needs of the small island state of Cura&ccedil;ao, in the Caribbean, by the end of the year 2017.
Cura&ccedil;ao's economy is likely to host greater numbers of tourists in the near future - the demand from extra visitors will exert significant pressure on national infrastructure systems, and, as a small island state, the risks associated with rising sea-levels need to be investigated.
Across the rest of 2017, Jade Leung (ITRC-MISTRAL/UNOPS) will be working with the government of Cura&ccedil;ao and representatives from other parts of the public, private and civic communities to build a shared understanding of the priorities for infrastructure development. Through the Fast Track Analysis process, the government and other stakeholders can explore different future scenarios and infrastructure strategies across a number of sectors, including energy, transport and solid waste. Through this work, we aim to enable decision-makers to understand the opportunities available for robust infrastructure policy options, as well as develop a better understanding of future vulnerabilities.The system for this assessment will be NISMOD-Int - a Strategy Development Framework. This will develop some standard themes and approaches for decision-makers; to support them as they apply NISMOD-Int data to creating practical, workable responses to future infrastructure challenges.The study will also help to decide on future infrastructure provision that will work well under the demands of population and tourism growth, and of climate change-driven sea-level rise. One important area of the analysis, undertaken by the ITRC's Lena Fuldauer, will work with the waste, wastewater and energy sectors, investigating the opportunities and risks that arise from interdependencies between these sectors.
This partnership forms part of a larger initiative by UNOPS to facilitate the roll-out and uptake of NISMOD-Int, as part of their programme on Evidence Based Infrastructure (EBI).

In addition, stakeholders from the Federal EPA for Ethiopia attended. Following introductory lectures on water quality modelling, Paul distributed copies of the INCA training model for flow, nitrate and ammonia and extensive training/practical sessions were undertaken. The new versions of INCA set up for the Awash River system were provided and a set of scenarios for point source and agricultural runoff were evaluated. In addition, new model setups for the INCA Metals model version were established to model metals in the Awash, Akiki and Rift Valley catchments. Sets of scenarios were evaluated to evaluate potential clean up scenarios with most concern over the highly toxic Chromium, lead, zinc and cadmium coming from Tannery effluents. Paul also gave a presentation on Biosensors for cell and genetic toxicity in contaminated rivers, lakes and soils. This was also of interest to Ethiopian colleagues because of the need to rapidly determine water toxicity in a rural environment. The Biosensors provide this possibility-see recently published paper below.

This is a recent trend, as until the turn of the century firms from developed economies dominated global cross-border direct investment. Because developing economies are the source of these investments, understanding the impact of such outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) on the home economies where these firms are headquartered is of great importance. OFDI can contribute to sustainable developmental outcomes, by generating home country effects which promote trade, employment, upgrading, growth and other aspects of economic development in source economies. Yet, the precise nature and characteristics of OFDI home country effects remain little understood. Moreover, even less is known about the most effective policies and measures governments can introduce to leverage OFDI for sustainable development. As a result, investment policymakers in developing countries have both a limited knowledge about the links between OFDI and home country sustainable development outcomes and remain hesitant to introduce policies to harness OFDI for sustainable development.","https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Outward_FDI_Insight_Report_2022.pdf","62307529a90101.44782908","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=62307529a90101.44782908&grantRef=ES%2FJ020583%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/J020583/1","BD5CA691-ED80-4F4B-ADF7-77DE683DB4A1","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","5BFB9036-9D16-4AB9-A9EF-097BB6FBD69A","DFD47E62-01FA-4AC2-BE54-2B1597CDD537"

The one hour meetings see the academic share their expertise in relation to a body of questions previously submitted by the Fellow. These meetings have tended to draw directly on both my research for the Stories of Change and Earth in Vision projects, and to the older but still relevant Interdependence Day project. The questions pertinent to my work have spanned: environmental sustainability and systems change (energy; transport etc); public understanding and engagement; new tools for public participation in policy; media decision-making. On most occasions climate change has been a prominent thread. I have explicitly outlined the research projects and the origins of the funding (AHRC for Earth in Vision and Stories of Change, and when relevant NERC-ESRC for the Interdependence Day project). The fact that I am so regularly asked to contribute to this programme run within and for another university suggests that the organisers (CSaP of the University of Cambridge) are getting positive feedback about the policy relevance and professional value of my advice and opinion.","http://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/policy-fellowships/policy-fellows/","58c40f12695c39.28637108","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=58c40f12695c39.28637108&grantRef=AH%2FL008173%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/L008173/1","86001BAE-2D2A-44FE-AAE3-ED68C58268DD","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","89E6D9CB-DAF8-40A2-A9EF-B330A5A7FC24","B2E6FCDE-58E6-49A3-B736-6945B8946152"

With partners we led the development of a comprehensive methodology to assist civil engineers and designers in accounting for climate change interdependencies when designing the HS2 route. In particular, we developed and implemented methods for describing the interdependencies; created a risk-based approach for assessing the impact of climate change on HS2 interdependencies; and prescribed a methodology for categorising, assessing and prioritising any HS2 vulnerabilities arising from these interdependencies.
The outcome of this work has resulted in HS2 Ltd incorporating over evidence in the civil designs process, which is a substantial part of the &pound;42.6 billion cost of the project.","https://innovation.ox.ac.uk/university-members/engaging-social-sciences/first-class-ticket-climate-change-resilience/","58c829fdb264a3.99385907","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=58c829fdb264a3.99385907&grantRef=NE%2FN012917%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/N012917/1","09B874E9-41D7-4E83-AE5C-8AA76A7FC09E","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","87375C3E-B225-4673-97F3-11C566ED0D4F"

Singapore. (31/05/2018 - 01/06/2018)","Influenced training of practitioners or researchers",,"Multiple continents/international","? Outputs &amp; outcomes:
Critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, water, waste and telecommunications exist as geospatial interdependent networks, supplying goods and services that support society and economy. The resilience of infrastructure networks is tested in external shocks, resulting in the potential for widespread cascading failures with catastrophic socio-economic consequences. For efficient resilience planning, there is a need to understand systemic vulnerabilities to prioritize resource allocation for network enhancement. We present a system-of-systems methodology to meet this need, by analysing the systemic resilience in terms of individual asset level and aggregated spatial vulnerability characteristics of interdependent critical infrastructure networks.

Defra appeared to ignore our recommendations when they published their draft proposals in 2019. I helped draft the submission from the Sustainable Soils Alliance, to the Defra public consultation on their proposals. We (the Science Panel of the Sustainable Soils Alliance) restated the need to include 'Healthy Soils' as a Headline Indicator in the government's draft 25 Year Plan for the Environment, alongside three underlying 'Condition of Assets' indicators. The text of our submissions are mounted and openly available on the Website of the sustainable Soils Alliance. Defra substantially altered their text in the final (post consultation revised) document on indicators to be used to develop the 25 Year Environment plan- with Soil Heath being raised in status to Headline Indicator 8, and no longer linked exclusively to land productivity and private goods, but is now correctly recognized as a &quot;National Asset&quot;.","https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/802094/25-yep-indicators-2019.pdf","5e5d0453194f06.93694899","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5e5d0453194f06.93694899&grantRef=BB%2FR021716%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/R021716/1","E9AAB5CB-4539-43E8-803E-03E0109E2816","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","11F06020-4069-43BF-A2D9-AA0A92463068"

There is increasing attention to the importance of biodiversity for food security and nutrition, especially above-ground biodiversity such as plants and animals. However, less attention is being paid to the biodiversity beneath our feet, soil biodiversity, which drives many processes that produce food or purify soil and water. This report is the result of an inclusive process involving more than 300 scientists from around the world under the auspices of the FAO's Global Soil Partnership and its Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative, and the European Commission. It presents concisely the state of knowledge on soil biodiversity, the threats to it, and the solutions that soil biodiversity can provide to problems in different fields. It also represents a valuable contribution to raising awareness of the importance of soil biodiversity and highlighting its role in finding solutions to today's global threats.","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb1928en","60423b83536f85.07995606","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=60423b83536f85.07995606&grantRef=NE%2FM00693X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M00693X/1","B5F089F0-103F-4460-BA01-1B7A031C9624","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","813F6E5A-7C55-44B1-BC26-C77FF12DBD2C"

Activities included: public exhibitions of research findings across the city (e.g. Roundhay Park, 29 April - 1 May 2017, attracting over 1,000 visitors); a new digital, photographic archive of Leeds's parks (http://www.leodis.net/); and regular project updates to LPGSF meetings (2016-19). Public engagement activities, widely covered in regional media (e.g. BBC Look North, 6 July 2016; BBC News, 25 April 2017), enhanced local understanding of parks and raised awareness of the difficulties parks face due to spending cuts and lack of statutory protection. Greater awareness and understanding contributed to an informed public consultation, shaping Parks and Countryside's 2020-2030 strategy. With Parks and Countryside managers and LPGSF, the research team led a public consultation event (over 900 attendees, 9 November 2019), which used research findings (via displays, an animated video, talks and workshops) to support civic engagement. Parks and Countryside cited the findings extensively in its consultation documents and used the research in over 35 consultation events (which produced over 2,000 responses).","https://democracy.leeds.gov.uk/documents/s194426/Item%209-%20Appendix%202%20-%20Towards%20a%20Leeds%20PGS%20Strategy%20to%202030.pdf","6033ecba0574c4.54577779","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=6033ecba0574c4.54577779&grantRef=AH%2FN001788%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/N001788/2","FD6A1B08-880A-4E93-A47E-D7ECFB880518","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","04B1D1F5-CB68-4A8F-890D-D7D703B01B8B"

However, less attention is being paid to the biodiversity beneath our feet, soil biodiversity, which drives many processes that produce food or purify soil and water. This report is the result of an inclusive process involving more than 300 scientists from around the world under the auspices of the FAO's Global Soil Partnership and its Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative, and the European Commission. It presents concisely the state of knowledge on soil biodiversity, the threats to it, and the solutions that soil biodiversity can provide to problems in different fields. It also represents a valuable contribution to raising awareness of the importance of soil biodiversity and highlighting its role in finding solutions to today's global threats.","http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb1928en","60423b83536f85.07995606","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=60423b83536f85.07995606&grantRef=NE%2FL008750%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L008750/1","3793BD7F-091A-45D4-9111-57CCEC4F5539","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4DB630C7-7E13-4610-A1C3-29601903CEE3","813F6E5A-7C55-44B1-BC26-C77FF12DBD2C"

innovation, and natural, social and behavioural sciences in the Department for 
Transport (DfT) (the term 'science' will be used as shorthand to cover all these 
activities). Placing science at the heart of DfT decision-making, it sets out our 
future ambition for the role of science in DfT strategy, policy and delivery. It 
highlights the role DfT is playing in the Government's ambitious vision for 
science and outlines how DfT will provide leadership and coordination across 
the transport R&amp;D landscape, so we can realise the unique opportunities 
science brings and address the challenges we face together. 

There is ongoing rapid change in the transport system, driven by technological 
development, changes in user expectations and behaviours, demographic 
change, and new business models that respond to and exploit the potential that 
data can offer (see Future of Mobility and the forthcoming Transport Data 
Strategy). Alongside these ongoing changes are three generation-defining 
events which require urgent action. First, the UK's exit from the EU, which gives 
us greater freedom and control to define our strengths on the world's stage. 
Second, a global pandemic which is changing how we live, work, and travel, the 
choices available to us, and public attitudes and behaviours towards travel. 
Third, the imperative for urgent climate action to tackle climate change and 
reduce the environmental impacts of transport as quickly as possible. All three 
events present a set of circumstances that offer new opportunities and require 
new ways of working across Government and the wider transport sector. It will 
not be possible to successfully navigate these challenges without a strong 
science system aligned with DfT's priorities. 
In this context the UK Government has committed to significant investment in 
R&amp;D: increasing spend to &pound;22 billion by 2024/25 and spending 2.4% of GDP on 
R&amp;D by 2027. This is the foundation on which we will cement the UK's position 
as a 'science superpower'. This Science Plan sets out for the transport R&amp;D 
community how DfT will work in partnership with them to deliver against these 
ambitions. 

While financial investment will be critical to enable the scale of science and 
innovation necessary to meet these challenges and sustain long-term 
investment and growth, it is not sufficient to drive the changes we need. This 
Science Plan sets out how DfT will continue to strengthen our People, 
Partnerships and Purpose, to support the development and delivery of the UK 
transport system of the future, both within DfT and across the whole transport 
sector.","https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1009520/science-plan-the-vision-for-science-in-dft.pdf.","6231ce0c3fe9d9.38085301","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=6231ce0c3fe9d9.38085301&grantRef=EP%2FN010612%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N010612/1","90AD8ADE-DBB7-46FE-B5EF-DEB72D525A07","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68","1524D51A-B9BA-48E7-B981-1FE98D625DE5"

I helped draft the submission from the Sustainable Soils Alliance, to the Defra public consultation on their proposals. We (the Science Panel of the Sustainable Soils Alliance) restated the need to include 'Healthy Soils' as a Headline Indicator in the government's draft 25 Year Plan for the Environment, alongside three underlying 'Condition of Assets' indicators.

Supported by CCCEP, the research focused initially on the city of Bristol in the UK where it analysed the energy use and carbon emissions and options for low carbon development in the city. The research report was launched at the international climate talks in Paris in December 2015, and it has underpinned the development of a new low carbon development strategy for the city of Bristol. Supported by the DRAGON Project, the research is now being extended to consider the embedded energy and carbon emissions associated with consumption in the city of Bristol. The research finds that including these embedded emissions in the analysis trebles the size of the carbon footprint of the city. It also highlights some major carbon reduction opportunities that have thus far been invisible and it suggests that cities may find much more carbon and potentially also cost effective opportunities for carbon reduction than those that are commonly recognised. In the coming months, the research will be extended to other cities in the UK, and used as the basis for a study that compares UK and Chinese cities.",,"56dec69831a699.65411832","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=56dec69831a699.65411832&grantRef=ES%2FL016028%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/L016028/1","B0E4261F-6C42-41A4-9333-BC77AAB8EB40","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","88C5F7F9-8DCC-41C9-BC4F-F37DA01075C7","CC0380D1-91DD-4AAB-9805-DBDAF639E25D"

innovation, and natural, social and behavioural sciences in the Department for 
Transport (DfT) (the term 'science' will be used as shorthand to cover all these 
activities). Placing science at the heart of DfT decision-making, it sets out our 
future ambition for the role of science in DfT strategy, policy and delivery. It 
highlights the role DfT is playing in the Government's ambitious vision for 
science and outlines how DfT will provide leadership and coordination across 
the transport R&amp;D landscape, so we can realise the unique opportunities 
science brings and address the challenges we face together. 

There is ongoing rapid change in the transport system, driven by technological 
development, changes in user expectations and behaviours, demographic 
change, and new business models that respond to and exploit the potential that 
data can offer (see Future of Mobility and the forthcoming Transport Data 
Strategy). Alongside these ongoing changes are three generation-defining 
events which require urgent action. First, the UK's exit from the EU, which gives 
us greater freedom and control to define our strengths on the world's stage. 
Second, a global pandemic which is changing how we live, work, and travel, the 
choices available to us, and public attitudes and behaviours towards travel. 
Third, the imperative for urgent climate action to tackle climate change and 
reduce the environmental impacts of transport as quickly as possible. All three 
events present a set of circumstances that offer new opportunities and require 
new ways of working across Government and the wider transport sector. It will 
not be possible to successfully navigate these challenges without a strong 
science system aligned with DfT's priorities. 
In this context the UK Government has committed to significant investment in 
R&amp;D: increasing spend to &pound;22 billion by 2024/25 and spending 2.4% of GDP on 
R&amp;D by 2027. This is the foundation on which we will cement the UK's position 
as a 'science superpower'. This Science Plan sets out for the transport R&amp;D 
community how DfT will work in partnership with them to deliver against these 
ambitions. 

While financial investment will be critical to enable the scale of science and 
innovation necessary to meet these challenges and sustain long-term 
investment and growth, it is not sufficient to drive the changes we need. This 
Science Plan sets out how DfT will continue to strengthen our People, 
Partnerships and Purpose, to support the development and delivery of the UK

He was given a tour of the exhibitions by Gina Fullerlove (Kew) and Vinita Damodaran (Sussex). . Ajay Narayan said that he planned four courses of action in response to the exhibition and to a recent meeting with the ZSI. The four courses of action were: 1) building more formalised collaborations between UK, Indian and American governmental ministries dealing with environment; 2) continuing work on digitisation and engaging in discussions about how to speed up this process; 3) involving institutions like NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training), to bring the knowledge to the common people, particularly school children; 4) talking to various institutions about touring the exhibition. This impact at a high level. We hope to meet with him further to push these policy imperatives. We also have an ongoing school project with impact on the education of vernacular school children who are appreciating going to the Kolkata Botanic garden and learning about environmental sustainability. More recently the exhibition toured Delhi. We also have had the initiative to digitally repatriate Indian plants from the Natural History Museum to India as part of the exercise to create a new Flora for British India.","http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cweh/research/indianocean","58bdb3f37e4886.03665270","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=58bdb3f37e4886.03665270&grantRef=AH%2FP005217%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P005217/1","F3046873-0D1E-40F3-88C1-D120D42E8978","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","A8967420-49D3-4509-9912-25FB3EC75B74","341A14E1-659D-49AE-9D88-F96FFF873D5A"

In the words of Guillermo Vargas, Director of the International Division on Trade in Goods and Services, the intention of the Forum, which is going to meet twice a year, is to have ?an institutional space. . . not to legislate, but to reduce frictions and perhaps to reduce trade disputes.? Mr. Lucas Assuncao, head of UNCTAD?s Trade, Environment, Climate Change and Sustainable Development Branch, added the hope that the Forum ?can ascertain the economic and environmental effectiveness of these measures;? discover to what extent they encourage local value addition and competitiveness; investigate links to other green policies and measures; investigate the impacts of these rules and regulations on trade; and discuss various approaches to reconciling the measures with trade rules.



The format of the Forum is that a panel of experts will discuss relevant issues with delegates and trade officials and attempt to moderate and suggest solutions. The expert hearing may be followed by a ?diplomacy dialogue? to give national delegations a change to engage with the experts.



?With the involvement of academics, policy economists, and trade officials, it is hoped that solutions may emerge that save such issues from going before more formal dispute-resolution mechanisms, such as those at the World Trade Organization?, Mr. Assuncao said.



The invitation to participate in the forum is in itself a recognition of the quality and reputation of the research done so far, including of the some of the outcomes of the research supported by the AHRC.



By being the only trade lawyer among the experts, I may well offer a significant input in the discussion and debate.",,"r-2891870637.32358762563912","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=r-2891870637.32358762563912&grantRef=AH%2FI001565%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/I001565/1","84A6612B-6A74-4E2B-85FA-8263CF35D5E2","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","2D0F8291-B3C2-484A-B90E-3D61B5727476"

He was given a tour of the exhibitions by Gina Fullerlove (Kew) and Vinita Damodaran (Sussex). . Ajay Narayan said that he planned four courses of action in response to the exhibition and to a recent meeting with the ZSI. The four courses of action were: 1) building more formalised collaborations between UK, Indian and American governmental ministries dealing with environment; 2) continuing work on digitisation and engaging in discussions about how to speed up this process; 3) involving institutions like NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training), to bring the knowledge to the common people, particularly school children; 4) talking to various institutions about touring the exhibition. This impact at a high level. We hope to meet with him further to push these policy imperatives. We also have an ongoing school project with impact on the education of vernacular school children who are appreciating going to the Kolkata Botanic garden and learning about environmental sustainability. More recently the exhibition toured Delhi. We also have had the initiative to digitally repatriate Indian plants from the Natural History Museum to India as part of the exercise to create a new Flora for British India.","http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cweh/research/indianocean","58bdb3f37e4886.03665270","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=58bdb3f37e4886.03665270&grantRef=AH%2FJ008559%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/J008559/1","8C154E7F-02A7-4765-A3C5-3077FA3F954D","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","A8967420-49D3-4509-9912-25FB3EC75B74","341A14E1-659D-49AE-9D88-F96FFF873D5A"

Not all carbon sequestered under these projects can be sold as carbon credits, a portion must be set aside in a buffer against future losses. The Forestry Commission has sought advice from the researcher on how big this buffer should be to cover potential losses from natural hazards such as wind, fire and pest and diseases. The researcher used her expertise gained from the Forest Finance Risk Network and also the PURE projects that arose from this network (NERC/PA 13-021 and NE/M008541/1) to provide recommendations to the working group on these buffers. 
The recommendations are provided here:
https://www.climatexchange.org.uk/media/3249/lessons-on-risk-management-from-the-finance-sector-for-climate-change-adaptation-in-scotlands-forestry-sector.pdf
The report recommended that the Woodland Carbon Code committee consider moving to a fixed buffer system. At this time, each project certified under the code had to conduct a risk assessment prior to project commencement, which was then independently verified, and used to assess the amount of carbon credits set aside as a buffer against future losses. The report suggested replacing this with a fixed amount for each project. Following this recommendation the Committee reviewed the proposal and in 2018 the Woodland Carbon Code system changed to a fixed buffer system.","https://www.climatexchange.org.uk/media/3249/lessons-on-risk-management-from-the-finance-sector-for-climate-change-adaptation-in-scotlands-forestry-sector.pdf","5464b34fd06ab2.73741835","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5464b34fd06ab2.73741835&grantRef=NE%2FJ019720%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/J019720/1","A0E16A48-97BE-4DBC-98AF-71BBA2ADF50A","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","D0B0A976-3651-4CBC-8603-F77621F6066A"

We have worked with 35 local government organisations to date which are now at various stages of setting both short and longer term carbon mitigation targets for the authority area, formally adopting these as targets, translating the targets into policies and then delivering changes in operation and practices. Greater Manchester, where we piloted the approach, is the most advanced on this process, with GMCA, Leeds City Region and Sheffield City Council at the translating to policy stage. Currently 18% of the UK population live in areas that have adopted our carbon budgets. A further 31 authorities are setting climate change targets using our approach

The following summary is taken from my response. 

Introduction : why we need mandatory Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG)
Currently biodiversity in the UK is under significant and ongoing decline with marked reductions across most ecosystem services first identified in the UKNEA (2011). 
Consistently there are other requirements such as housing and employment land needs that dictate the development agenda. Biodiversity comes to the table often at a later stage in the planning process weakened unless the development sits in a protected site. 
Mandatory BNG creates a level playing field, where developers know what they need to deliver up-front and are able to establish the strong partnerships needed for effective placemaking and biodiversity enhancements. 
However key to the success of any mandatory scheme are the resources and guidance to ensure that it is not bypassed, misused or evaded. 
First, there needs to be baseline (state of nature report) which can be used to measure and monitor progress. This has to have nationwide coverage; more than the nature recovery network as outlined in the 25 year environment plan. 
Second, the mitigation hierarchy has to be positioned as the mandatory decision making structure from which BNG considerations are developed. There is a risk that BNG gets disconnected from the mitigation hierarchy given the desire to get to offsetting stages rather than seek different sites or avoid damage. There is incomplete understanding of BNG within the mitigation hierarchy. 
Third, the issue of monitoring and enforcement needs to be properly resourced concomitant with a clearer understanding over what timescale the mandatory increase should be judged to have been achieved. There can be no one size fits all approach here as the BNG will be dependent on the nature of the habitat being created, the effort required, and the time needed to reach the required standard and maintain it for the long-term. (I assume this to be at least 30 years). Without proper resources devoted to this there is a risk that the promised BNGs will not be delivered and there needs to be clarity over when monitoring interventions can be made to require changes if the BNG is not going to be delivered. 
Fourth, there are some habitats which are deemed irreplaceable and are therefore not suitable for the BNG model. However if they are then removed it should not be possible for any developer to claim that the development is delivering BNG. By removing the irreplaceable habitats outside the scope of net gain there is a risk that BNG ingredients are considered in isolation. In such circumstances BNG cannot not should be claimed by default. 
Fifth, forthcoming guidance on achieving BNG from CIRIA may be helpful for this but there is an urgent need for effective guidance for the built environment sector to show how BNG can be achieved through case studies and demonstration projects. Not enough attention is paid to ensuring that concise and usable guidance is produced and clearly this will also need to be translated into the NPPG where there is something of a policy void. . 
We also need to move away from the current approach of policy disintegration where different areas of policy are designed, implemented and evaluated in isolation . So for example clear opportunities for joined up policy exist through the Agriculture Bill and Industrial challenges (from the BEIS Industrial Strategy) to enable future land use to be managed in a way that reduces negative impacts on biodiversity and the natural environment. 
However perhaps the biggest issue facing our understanding and delivery of effective BNG is the incremental conflation of terms that now form part of the core environmental vocabulary. Often these terms are used loosely and without reference to each other and crucially without a full understanding of how these terms relate to each other. BNG should not be viewed as separate to such terms. Yet there is limited academic research or commentary on the nature of the interrelationships between natural capital, ecosystem services, green infrastructure, biodiversity net gain and environmental net gains which now permeate environmental policy and practice. In my view BNG cannot be fully understood without reference to these terms and, indeed, stepping out wider to social, and economic net gains which are present in the revised NPPF.","https://mainstreaminggreeninfrastructure.com/outputs-page.php?response-to-the-consultation-on-the-defra-net-gain-proposals","5c8a28d190cc85.66444457","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5c8a28d190cc85.66444457&grantRef=NE%2FR00398X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/R00398X/1","CF842AEF-EBA2-421B-BF74-36B62DDCF0D3","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","EF390CF0-ECD3-47D8-B9A8-7602AF319BEE","CC6423BB-AF63-4F29-BDD2-3B86D967509E"

Not all carbon sequestered under these projects can be sold as carbon credits, a portion must be set aside in a buffer against future losses. The Forestry Commission has sought advice from the researcher on how big this buffer should be to cover potential losses from natural hazards such as wind, fire and pest and diseases. The researcher used her expertise gained from the Forest Finance Risk Network and also the PURE projects that arose from this network (NERC/PA 13-021 and NE/M008541/1) to provide recommendations to the working group on these buffers. 
The recommendations are provided here:
https://www.climatexchange.org.uk/media/3249/lessons-on-risk-management-from-the-finance-sector-for-climate-change-adaptation-in-scotlands-forestry-sector.pdf
The report recommended that the Woodland Carbon Code committee consider moving to a fixed buffer system. At this time, each project certified under the code had to conduct a risk assessment prior to project commencement, which was then independently verified, and used to assess the amount of carbon credits set aside as a buffer against future losses. The report suggested replacing this with a fixed amount for each project. Following this recommendation the Committee reviewed the proposal and in 2018 the Woodland Carbon Code system changed to a fixed buffer system.","https://www.climatexchange.org.uk/media/3249/lessons-on-risk-management-from-the-finance-sector-for-climate-change-adaptation-in-scotlands-forestry-sector.pdf","5464b34fd06ab2.73741835","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5464b34fd06ab2.73741835&grantRef=NE%2FI022183%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/I022183/1","843FD259-AD65-4AC9-828D-4E456A9EEA69","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","D0B0A976-3651-4CBC-8603-F77621F6066A"

In the spring of 2016 Adaptation Scotland arranged for me to liaise with the Edinburgh Adaptation team as part of my fellowship activities. This was near the end of an in-depth consultation with numerous stakeholders and the public across Edinburgh. At the time, there were no coastal actions included in the draft Edinburgh Adapts plan. Yet, much of the Northern and Eastern border of Edinburgh is the coast, much of which (e.g. Portobello) is at risk under at changing climate. I led on the discussions between University of Glasgow and the Edinburgh Adapts team, which led to us finessing two actions (BE18 and BE19) for inclusion in the final version of the Adaptation Plan which was published in December 2016. The impact arising from this activity is broadening of the topics (i.e. the coast) and geographic coverage of the Edinburgh Adapts Action Plan which improves the environmental sustainability of the document (as it includes a key area of the city region that was overlooked prior to our engagement). Further activities are planned to help raise awareness of coastal climate change risks for Edinburgh to help deliver against our actions in the plan.","http://www.adaptationscotland.org.uk/application/files/5514/7940/1819/Edinburgh_Adapts_Adaptation_Action_Plan_Final_For_Web.pdf","58c5c871edf133.20875386","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=58c5c871edf133.20875386&grantRef=NE%2FM010546%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M010546/1","E0C794F6-9B16-4B36-A5AB-6486A7A19278","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","AE58F21F-3622-4382-97BB-1359BD183E9F","D635A3CF-2BB1-4527-B410-B448C2CB7A00"

Following this presentation it was noted that the meeting appreciated the NIMFRU interventions at the community level and suggestions were made that Etop radio can partner with a Katakwi-based radio called Joshua FM to ensure a wider reach of the information flow to the Katakwi communities where it is more grounded and also explore alternatives of more sub-counties to be considered for the FAMVACs.

Letter to evidence impact of research

To whom it may concern,

I would like to indicate that the research conducted by Dr Christian Reynolds on his NERC Innovation Placement at Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme (WRAP) (Grant Ref: NE/R007160/1) has been useful to WRAP and Ogilvy in the design of interventions for the Behaviour change intervention project.

Specifically, a draft version of his literature review and design recommendations for food waste interventions (current working title &quot;Consumption-stage food waste reduction interventions - what works and why.&quot;) helped inform us of the landscape of existing interventions, which we found most useful when conceptualising our interventions. In addition, his input into the ideation and design of interventions at the co-creation session held at Ogilvy on the 12th of March 2018 was invaluable.

Our interventions will take place in 2018 and contribute to the overall Courtauld Commitment 2025 goal to reduce food waste by 20% by 2025. If successful, the 20% equates to a reduction of 10 million tonnes of food waste - which is equivalent to saving &pound;20 billion pounds in food, or 18 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.

Yours,

Eleanor Heather

Senior Behavioural Strategist

These are areas of restricted exploitation from fisheries which protect marine biodiversity and its associated seafloor habitats. This enhances the sustainable credentials for existing fisheries, which are managed by CCAMLR (Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources). A first technical workshop on developing systematic conservation planning for MPAs in domains of the Weddell, Bouvet-Maud and Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas was held in Brussels, Belgium between 11 and 14 September 2012 with EVOLHIST members Katrin Linse and Huw Griffiths. Biodiversity data were aggregated and conservation objectives were developed for the individual domains. These will be included in future systematic conservation planning processes, which will be developed through CCAMLR using the data aggregated at the workshop. EVOLHIST scientists David Barnes and Huw Griffiths were centrally involved in a scientific workshop and stakeholder meeting (18-19/04/2012) to determine new protections within the MPA spanning South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands for both benthic and pelagic species. During the meeting, new offshore no-take protection zones and a ban on fishing at depths over 2.25km were proposed. These were reported to the South Georgia Government, who then incorporated these proposals into law in their fisheries management of the region.

• the UK shipping emissions could be reduced to zero by 2050 if the government's central carbon price value are applied to bunker fuels, 
• energy efficiency improvements alone will not be sufficient and that the use of alternative fuels (such as hydrogen, ammonia or methanol) will be required, 
• LNG is not estimated to be a substantial part of the fuel mix in the future and electrification will play a smaller role compared to alternative fuels. 
• Under the assumptions of the modelled scenarios, ammonia generally fared as a better option over methanol for the majority of ship types and sizes, though an adverse side-effect of this is the scale of associated NOx emissions that would need to be addressed. 

The significance of the policy insights gained through GloTraM enabled the UK government to have a target that mandates all new vessels for UK waters ordered from 2025 should be designed with zero-emission capable technologies.","https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clean-maritime-plan-maritime-2050-environment-route-map","5e699a20a09f69.40352543","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5e699a20a09f69.40352543&grantRef=EP%2FK039253%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K039253/1","51BE98BF-8CEE-4D9F-A039-0799A97C88CF","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","4FFFB058-60C4-4355-AA35-40C78A69DF3D"

The report recommends that Defra introduces a national pollinator monitoring programme, revises its Action Plan for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, introduces a range of sentinel pollinator species in UK pesticide risk assessments and supports a proposal by the EU to ban use of three neonicotinoid pesticides in January 2014. One of these actions (developing a national pollinator monitoring scheme) was taken forward in the National Pollinator Strategy for England launched in November 2014, although the action is a research project to scope and cost and monitoring programme, rather than a commitment to resource one.

The most prominent contributions from the grant holder (Lynn Dicks) were to describe the state of existing scientific knowledge on wild pollinator declines, to explain why different groups of wild pollinators experience different risks from pesticides and to speculate on what evidence would be required to generate certainty on the impact of pesticides on wild pollinator populations.

(13/09/2018)","Participation in a advisory committee",,"Multiple continents/international","? Outputs &amp; outcomes:
Fulai Sheng of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) contacted the UNOPS group of the ITRC by email, and copied in Rob Jones (Rob Jones, Head, The Caribbean Resilient Infrastructure Alliance), on 12/09/2018 with reference to developing a work stream on sustainable infrastructure in connection to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate actions. UNEP were keen to reach out to UNOPS for partnership and building on UNOPS work. Further contact by telephone was arranged

Also on 13/09/2018 Steven Crosskey of UNOPS contacted Fulai Sheng (and copied to Trevor Sway and Nick O'Regan, both of UNOPS) to reach some common ground with reference to a number of initiatives active with UNOPS at that date:
1. UNOPS have developed a Capacity Assessment Tool for Infrastructure (CAT-I) to understand how entities Plan, Deliver and Manage their infrastructure assets. This is a comprehensive look at all aspects of governance around infrastructure leading to practical recommendations for action, to build on strengths and address gaps.
2. a) UNOPS have worked very closely with the ITRC Group of the University of Oxford in several areas including the development of the National Infrastructure Systems Model for Infrastructure, (NISMOD-int), based on the ground breaking work done by ITRC for the UK infrastructure sector, but appropriate for developing nations (where data is generally less available). We have piloted the tool in Palestine, and Curacao island, and presently we have one or two more in the pipeline. This allows us to gather asset data across infrastructure sectors - (water, waste, ICT, Energy and Transport, as well as social infrastructure - health, education Rule of Law, Economic structure, housing etc.), and model current and future demand based on development goals, as well as input hazard data to investigate current and future vulnerabilities in a 'systems of systems' approach.
2. b) UNOPS are jointly supporting and attending the Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) event - The Global congress on engineering and the SDG's in late October. (https://www.ice.org.uk/events/global-engineering-congress ). For this they are in the process of developing a paper, based on research by ITRC Oxford, on the relationship of Infrastructure to the SDG targets, highlighting its role, and importance. We have also written a short introduction for the Congress brochure, and an expanded piece to go to all participants to highlight the role of Engineers in the SDG's.
2. c) A paper on Small Island Developing states and effects of climate change and the importance of Infrastructure, based on case studies for work ongoing in Curacao and St. Lucia in both of which UNOPS of the ITRC (the University of Oxford) is partaking.
Mr Jones believed it would be very useful to discuss the matter further with Mr O'Regan, as there is a clear need to be able to being together the physical infrastructure (built assets etc) and the natural infrastructure (wetlands, mangrove forests etc.) that should be combined to address some of developing countries greatest needs to drive for sustainable development, and combat the negative effects of climate change on the risk environment. Mr O'Regan's interest in developing a work stream on sustainable infrastructure could be a great opportunity to partner in this important area.

The presentation was titled 'Eco and Resilient Factories: A New Paradigm for High Performance Production'. ABSTRACT: Today, manufactures must first test production of products &amp; services across the lifecycle before actual production has even begun. This can be achieved through emerging enabling technologies such as &quot;lifecycle analytics&quot; that contribute to a new paradigm of closed-loop production systems. It is guided by the principles that products, processes &amp; interlinked services are challenged by evolving external drivers such as new regulations, materials, technologies, cost and sustainability - all of which requires coordinated co-evolution of products, production systems &amp; services.",,"5c8a66b79e39d0.98961919","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5c8a66b79e39d0.98961919&grantRef=EP%2FK019368%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K019368/1","FECAEA37-AFA2-49F7-92BA-C820613A29D1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","B6FB652A-60C3-48DD-9A33-075D1F759B48","2B52D877-6029-4BCB-91C5-9F2BE744A7B0"

Along with farmer field listening groups and multi-stakeholder groups, agri-educational radio programming addresses the training needs of smallholders by establishing a dialogue directly with rural farming populations, delivering live, relevant and real-time updates on issues affecting their crops and livelihoods In June 2017, the Lorna Young Foundation prepared radio extension training with CARE and Christian Aid Sahel to launch BRAVE's radio extension program. This was extended with further community engagement in April 2018 in Burkina Faso and Ghana through a reflection on seasonal planning challenges with newly established farmer listening groups. The use of reflective diaries by the community groups has additionally created a structure for members to regularly discuss their learning and record activities. The aim of the radio extension program is to improve the resilience of farming communities to weather shocks, lack of access to good quality water and to support conservation of resources. To achieve this, communities have participated in the construction of themes for the radio broadcasts, reflected on the information approach, and shared knowledge about their own farming and observational experience. Follow up engagement with communities in August 2018 focuses on monitoring activities and an assessment of the learning and delivery approach. This feedback will ensure adjustments in the approach to meet different farmers' needs. Furthermore, to ensure sustainability in the approach - where the integrated Rainwatch information can been interpreted and communicated to different users, we have leveraged addition support to develop a training manual for science interpretors, the piloting of feedback on scenarios and the implications for crop use and groundwater. Most significantly here, is the need to ensure that the project establishes a sustainable mechanism for future information delivery to communities, beyond the pilot communities and funded radio broadcasts, and to achieve this additional impact is now working in the last 2 months to embed the approach within existing institutional structures in order to outscale - for example the RELC platform in northern Ghana, through SARI which brings together agricultural extension, crop specialists, NGOs, universities and to train and connect with Ghana-Met. This process will ensure local ownership, innovation of the communication of the tool and its application.",,"5c8a2cb06f4676.10385158","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5c8a2cb06f4676.10385158&grantRef=NE%2FM008983%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M008983/1","C074E663-3B5F-414A-83E9-804B9180EA42","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","E89C3602-0FB4-4044-A918-58966B8A10B2","8052BB87-7123-4292-9517-F284DD425B3E"

The aims of the World Bank are to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. They fund billions of dollars' worth of projects in less developed countries every year. Over the past two decades the bank has introduced a set of standards aiming to ensure any impact of their projects on people and the environment is identified, avoided and minimised (its environmental and social safeguards or ESS). In 2012 they launched a review of these policies. We repsonded to the third and final phase.

Some of field work the p4ges team has been doing around CAZ has relevance to the implementation of the bank's social safeguards (see our recent paper in Global Environmental Change). The work of Cecile Bidaud Rakotoarivony (espa fellow linked to the p4ges project) on the social impacts of biodiversity offsets has relevance to the new guidelines on biodiversity offsets. A number of us therefore have submitted a response, based on the field work we have done as part of the p4ges project, to the 3rd and final phase of the consultation which closes on the 15th March 2016.

We made five main points (elaborated in our response):
1) Explicit reference should be made to the importance of ensuring that local people are aware of the existence of the grievance procedure and how to use it. People who are particularly vulnerable (and rightly deserving of special attention in the ESSs) are likely to be particularly isolated from information transfer mechanisms-a reason why this requires special attention.

2) Where World Bank funded projects operate in remote rural situations in poor countries there may not be sufficient information on the location of local communities to allow the borrower to develop an effective plan for identifying and compensating affected persons. We would suggest more emphasis should be given to improving this background information where it is inadequate. We suggest that the borrower should make public the map they are using for planning this process: creating a pressure to improve such maps and an opportunity for advocates of local people to highlight any omissions.

3) &quot;The Bank's vision goes beyond 'do no harm' to maximizing development gains&quot; (p.6) which is a very positive aspiration. However, the wording of specific mitigation plans adds 'or at least restore' their [affected peoples'] livelihoods and living standards. This makes the conditions less stringent than appears in the introduction to the document and means that safeguards do not strictly have to 'go beyond' doing no harm.

4) Free Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) is not applied universally- it is only invoked in the case of 'Indigenous Peoples'. Given that, particularly in Africa, many ethnic groups have not self-identified as 'indigenous people', we suggest it would be better to talk of 'indigenous peoples and local communities' as is done in the Convention on Biological Diversity and apply the same FPIC principle to both.

5) Where biodiversity offsets are applied explicit consideration should be given to the fact that biodiversity offsets may result in physical and/or economic displacement. We suggest a note should be added making it clear that ESS5 (that which refers to economic or physical displacement of people) applies and should be followed in all such cases.

The Bank used responses to amend the final version which was passed in August 2016. It is difficult to attribute any changes in the final version to our cntribution but we are pleased to see the changes from Free Prior Informed Cnsultation to Free Prior Informed Consent.","http://p4ges.org/news/WorldBankconsultationblog.php.en","58b80ef564ed09.79252578","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=58b80ef564ed09.79252578&grantRef=NE%2FK010220%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K010220/1","7831D96F-B9D6-419E-B452-2A90A3C80E79","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","F9F1D136-12E3-4BE4-9668-0C9BC4A7C1BF","D910B873-32DD-4556-960E-64D023E08928"

Recently, one of these models has led to a step change in how the Environment Agency investigate aquifer vulnerability, aquifer recharge potential and the interaction between ground and surface waters. Previously the Groundwater Team relied on traditional 2D aquifer vulnerability maps to respond to incidents and build conceptual understanding of the subsurface. However, the use of these maps has now been replaced by the 3D model and derived 2D products created therefrom. The 3D model provides much richer information about the structure of the subsurface in three-dimensions and allows significantly improved conceptualisation of groundwater flow processes. The BGS model is delivered via the LithoFrame Viewer, which is a BGS visualisation and analysis software package. It enables the team to view the models via 2D sections and maps and three-dimensional visualisations. It is used daily for incidence response and provides an essential knowledge base for the Environment Agency Team. It has had major impact on front-line decision making and work continues to deploy the methodology and software at other EA offices.

Melissa Swartz (EA Groundwater Technical Specialist) writes: &quot;We commissioned BGS to build two drift geological hydro-domain models for principal aquifers in the North East one as a 2D hydrodomain layer, and the other as a 3D model. Both have improved our conceptual understanding of the aquifers and have provided the best data we have to spatially assess recharge, the pollution risk to groundwater, GW/SW interaction and GW flooding. We have used visual outputs from these layers and models to highlight the risks to groundwater to both internal and external partners. These layers/models help support our regulation of permitted industries, management of groundwater resources, regulation of landfills and assessment of planning applications. We also use this information to help us prioritise our workload.&quot;",,"545a487eb86956.55357848","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=545a487eb86956.55357848&grantRef=bgs04001","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=bgs04001","CDFA3923-CBF8-4DAC-B100-66E068CDA4E1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","7ADE0AB2-1050-4241-987D-F3B1C3322E05","59031008-A7FB-43DD-9274-504BD6411797"

Briefly, Jones participated (presented) at a Defra/Innovate UK-organised Air Quality Workshop (21st Sept 2017) which included emissions from power, industry, heat, transport and will inform the UK air quality strategy. It was highlighted that emissions from wood burning can be tackled by four main approaches: technology (appliance) used; mode of operation of appliance; fuel used; control devices. Some of the work of from Leeds was summarised (Supergen Bioenergy, CDT Bionergy and CDT Low Carbon Technologies). Effect of appliance type was illustrated by emissions of PM10 from multifuel (uncontrolled) stoves compared with other technologies relative to this. The message was that emissions dropped when there was improved appliance design (air control, secondary combustion chamber etc), and that pellet boilers + control device were the cleanest option. The effect of operation (e.g. cold start vs full load) and implications for this in terms of heat storage options, correct sizing etc was presented. Work showing that fuel type impacts on particulate was also presented, and the advantages of smokeless and torrefied fuel for PM emissions demonstrated (the latter highlighted as an area of future research), together with the relationship between fuel-N and NOx. Finally some options for mitigation devices were presented, including novel work in the Supergen Bioenergy Hub (and highlighted as an area for future research and innovation). The presentation concluded with examples of interventions taken elsewhere in the World. Following on from this Jones has also been invited to a second workshop (Defra) in Jan 2018 concerning the measurement of particulate matter from domestic stoves and a hosted a workshop in Leeds in February 2018 - the outcome of these activities is informing the industry standard in the UK, and includes representatives from HETAS, Stove Industry Aliance, and some key consultants, as well as Defra.",,"5a9e6790607726.09929722","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5a9e6790607726.09929722&grantRef=EP%2FE039995%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/E039995/1","C9EA65A6-B7D0-436D-BF88-67315792AFAE","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","EA45E499-1319-4E93-A5AF-EA3951A29EBD"

Renewable technologies are subsidised via a &quot;contract for difference&quot;, and the strike price is set by an auction. This was originally designed and managed by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), and has now been transferred to the department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).

Since the ESRC project start, the Co-Investigator has been in contact with the design team, highlighting problems and potential problems, and suggesting possible improvements. 

The auction was run in February 2015 and again in April 2017. Discussions continue on future modifications.

Back in 2012, the Co-Investigator developed possible design templates with DECC. Several significant aspects of the auction design used follow the original recommendations of the Co-Investigator, but the final design was not developed in tandem with us in the same way as in the Bank of England.","https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contracts-for-difference/contract-for-difference","54623c6c1ebbd3.58525847","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=54623c6c1ebbd3.58525847&grantRef=ES%2FL003058%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/L003058/1","72F57357-44C9-40A6-A2B2-65DA794151E2","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","3ABE4345-24B0-43F3-9148-A057E7F04194"

However, PV technology is expensive, as is electricity storage, and also has very significant levels of embedded energy. The present discussion with personnel from DECC centred around alternative thermal-based solutions (e.g. ORC power-generations systems, based on suitable reciprocating components which are idea at such small-scales), far more affordable thermal energy storage, and dual energy output (electrical and thermal, e.g. for hot water) leading to much lower costs per unit energy. DECC expressed a very real interest in this alternative, also thanks to the far more flexible, controllable and wide operating envelope of such a system.

Both public bodies and industrial company partners are contributing in-kind time and technical expertise to all relevant work streams.

Outcomes: An action plan that UKCCSRC and its partners are taking forward through a series of workshops/streams (6 regional cluster meetings have been held). Widening engagement through those work streams (having seen UKCCSRC output, the Board of the industry body, CCSA, has recommended that they undertake regionally-focused activities).

(Sept 2018)","Participation in a national consultation",,"National","The purpose of this project is to inform the Adaptation Sub-Committee's (ASC) Evidence Report for the upcoming UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 3 (CCRA3), the ASC is commissioning a range of research projects funded by Defra, the devolved administrations and research councils, which aim to improve the science and impact of the CCRA. This specific project aims to assess and prioritise risks deriving from interactions and cascading effects between the natural environment, built environment and infrastructure, allowing policy makers to understand how to achieve desired outcomes at least cost and avoid unintended consequences. The results will be used throughout the Evidence Report to highlight cross-cutting issues. Unless cross-cutting issues are considered, actions could be ineffective, sub-optimal in terms of their costs and benefits, or lead to unintended consequences.
The current evidence on interacting risks was considered in the chapter for the 2016 Evidence Report on cross-cutting issues. 
The project aims and objects include considering climate risks and their effect on the natural/built environment and infratructure; how these interactions affect the overall level of risk, risk likelihood, risk by different locations; risk prioritization; how risk may be addressed.

The methodology will require an approach to conducting a literature review of existing systems models (for example ITRC/NISMOD, TIM model, National Infrastructure Commission modelling) to include an assessment of what models can do and their benefits and limitations. In addition, assessing the interactions of climate risks between the natural and built environments, and infrastructure, taken from the results of existing systems models and previous analysis conducted for CCRA1 and CCRA2. A framework for prioritising interactions will be required, and how the research results can be used in the ASC's assessment of urgency in CCRA3, and by adaptation decision makers in policy making.

The final report is to be prepared for publishing on the ASC's website during January 2020.

The project's findings have also been used in the five study events for Saijo High Schools in Japan and in the UK. These events were organised around the project's research themes which were used not only in lectures but also as the case studies and discussion topics for students to think deeply about current energy problems and the future challenges of creating a sustainable society. Furthermore, for Saijo City, the project organised an art competition and a public event in 2016. The art competition raised awareness of energy and environmental issues among the city's schoolchildren, while the public event contributed to consolidate the city's energy policy. A visible impact was the city's 'renewable building programme' (Jan 2017) that was directly and indirectly informed by the collaboration between the city and the project.","http://www.city.saijo.ehime.jp/site/gikai/280302.html","56d99b9c41a5e6.44308881","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=56d99b9c41a5e6.44308881&grantRef=AH%2FK006088%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/K006088/1","D3BE87D5-00DF-48A1-8AC1-5CAF20151A8E","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","3E18DACB-05AA-4C71-88FB-C909A8311BB5","E00FD4A6-B710-4A74-9F4C-F6E0D942806E"

Title of Session: Sustainable Urban Futures Workshop

Summary: Sustainable urban development, no matter what definition is used, is all about the future - putting in place solutions that will yield a positive legacy in cities, where most of the world's population now lives. Urban resilience is about putting in place solutions that are resistance to future uncertainties. The essential underlying question is 'how sustainable are these solutions?' while the answer inevitably is 'it depends on how the future develops'. However, predicting the future is complex - arguably, the only certainties are that there will be change, and that we must learn to live within the resource limitations of our planet. The Urban Futures Method aims to broaden the way we think about the form, function, and context of urban development and regeneration by focussing on the likely long-term performance of today's urban design solutions, and their associated vulnerabilities (see http://designingresilientcities.co.uk/).
 
In this workshop, we present and apply the Urban Futures Method to test the likely future performance of urban development and regeneration-related 'sustainability solutions' - actions taken today in the name of sustainability - in a series of possible future scenarios in the year 2050. If a proposed solution delivers a positive legacy, regardless of the future against which it is tested, then it can be adopted with confidence. The Method provides insights into the potential impacts of today's urban planning and design decisions, and challenges the conventional mainstream approach to sustainability by incorporating changing priorities and different ways of thinking into today's actions, with the intention to ensure relevance in the future.

According to the EA, the nitrate time bomb model and its outputs have been used at both the policy and local level in England.

The Future of National Infrastructure
Dr Scott Thacker and Prof Jim Hall (University of Oxford)
Infrastructure forms the economic backbone of modern society. It is a key determinant of economic competitiveness, social well-being and environmental sustainability. Yet infrastructure systems (energy, transport, water, waste and digital communications), in multiple contexts globally, face a range of serious challenges. There have been many calls for a more strategic, long-term approach to national infrastructure in the UK and elsewhere around the world. Whilst appealing in principle, in practice developing a national infrastructure strategy poses major challenges of complexity and uncertainty. The UK Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC) has set out a systematic methodology for long term analysis of the 
performance of national infrastructure systems, which deals with each infrastructure sector (energy, transport, digital communications, water supply, waste water and solid waste) in a consistent framework and assesses the interdependencies between infrastructure sectors. The methodology is supported with the world's first infrastructure system of systems model (NISMOD), which has been developed for long term decision analysis in interdependent infrastructure systems. Following an introduction of the ITRC and NISMOD, this presentation provides details of a number of applications of the model to the UK and beyond. In doing so, it provides examples of how system-based modelling is being used to support decision making within government and industry at a range of scales.

The tool comprises an interactive map that shows the current and potential future distribution of commuter cycling trips under different potential future growth scenarios. It provides numerical and graphical outputs, including estimated numbers of cyclists in an area, and along desire lines and routes. 3.35 The Propensity to Cycle Tool can assist with the preparation of Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans and will be of particular assistance in defining potential demand for cycling, identifying the most promising routes and areas for investment, and estimating future capacity needs for route and area-based measures.

In this distribution a number of models exhibit an ECS to a doubling of CO2 of greater than 4.5&deg;C, with 5 models (so far) suggesting values in excess of 5&deg;C. Presentations described the ECS results and discussed a number of early theories as to the cause of the increased ECS. Presentations also touched on the implications of these higher ECS values for the CMIP6 scenarioMIP future projections and whether key policy goals, such as the 1.5/2&deg;C global warming limits might be more likely to be exceeded compared to findings from earlier CMIP cycles. Implications for global carbon budgets to realize such policy goals, with varying degrees of certainty were also discussed, as were a range of policy and adaptation consequences related to a potentially more sensitive global climate system.","https://www.crescendoproject.eu/climate-sensitivity-in-cmip6-causes-consequences-and-uses/","5e5fb54f7ba831.73403431","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5e5fb54f7ba831.73403431&grantRef=NE%2FN017978%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/N017978/1","8FB62D3D-4FBF-4B53-8FA9-A5C95E91EB19","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","0F53B7F0-D282-4D63-A196-5AF3BDAD7761"

BGS, alongside CEH, maintain a national archive of hydrological data, which have provided the foundation for several scientific initiatives associated with drought, including development of forecasts of drought development over 6 to 24 month periods. An operational forecasting capability has been developed for key groundwater sites across major aquifers in England using a groundwater model developed by BGS. The seasonal forecasts for water resources over the next 24 months have been utilised by Defra's National Drought Management Group, and by Environment Agency operational teams. Although the 2012 drought broke, the techniques developed are already being refined for operational application in future hydrological outlook products. Even before 2011-2012, the economic impact of drought on European countries over the last 30 years has been estimated at 100 billion euros, so even modest improvements in forecasting water availability can have major impacts. Forecasting systems can also be applied to groundwater flooding issues. These will be used by Defra, the regulators and water companies in planning for future drought events, and the modelling capability can be used to test climate change scenarios.

Wider benefits from the programme, such as indirect jobs, environmental improvements, greater tax revenues and reduced spending on energy, transport and waste infrastructure, will also accrue to communities. 

Eight major barriers to improving non-resource productivity were found in the NMR study. Four of these barriers apply to most opportunities: senior executive leadership, information, skills and resources. The other four barriers relate to specific types of opportunities and also warrant attention: design, infrastructure, legal constraints and collaboration.

A programme to address these barriers has been developed in consultation with a range of multinational manufacturers, relevant government departments, NGOs and experts around the world.","http://www.nextmanufacturingrevolution.org/","5461d6448d91f3.29301517","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5461d6448d91f3.29301517&grantRef=EP%2FI033351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I033351/1","55AB8CA6-FEC5-48D1-B3D8-13ED830934CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","68F9AC3F-225C-4FAD-A645-C2F5A9BBB85A"

using nQuire to structure their investigations. There were fruitful discussions that helped bring closer nonacademic
and academic organisations. Also, the use of 'citizen inquiry' as a means to engage the public with
activities that can support their learning (Climate change and You mission) was shown to work for some of
the participants leading to enhanced learning and awareness about climate issues.

Information from participants was collected from workshop activity sheets and workshop feedback, three interviews and two
questions embedded in the Climate change and You mission. In the workshops, participants learnt through discussions about how
to design a scientifically robust mission and how to achieve impact in particular, they discussed issues about: (a) data accuracy:
different devices for measuring temperature will have different degrees of error, perceptions of temperature will vary across people
and relate to what they wear, where they are etc, making researchers visible can help volunteers resolve any questions they may
have, train volunteers on how to collect accurate datasets. (b) recruitment and impact: ask simple questions and use simple language
for people to understand and take part in, show volunteers the benefits of sharing their data, and link them up to online resources
they can learn more from, show comparative data charts so people can see how they relate to others in their neighbourhood, or
country, present findings using simple graphs, narratives or infographics, share findings with policy makers to encourage change. (c)
Feedback about nQuire: a) let people know about the provision of immediate feedback at the mission brief, b)present mission
findings in a comprehensive and simple way, c) check the platform design for accessibility, d) use the tool to empower the public, to
help them produce robust evidence that can be used to bring change in their everyday lifes (e.g., noise map mission in the
workplace), e) explain who the researchers or citizens are that are doing the mission, f) add brunching elements to questions and a
search buttom, g) let participants know they should take part, h) test the mission with citizens with no scientific background, i)
provide more language options, h) explain what the approval process is.
Interviews: Three people who have been involved in developing missions on nQuire platform were individually interviewed and
shared insights about: a) the role of citizen science in their organisation: Participants said that CS has a role to play in organisations
in particular to enable active engagement from an audience that can learn about a topic of interest and become part of a solution.
It can have a broad reach, including young people taking part in scientific projects. It can be a bridge between universities and local
community organisations.b) The role of citizens: They said that it is useful to involve the citizens in the design of a research project
and to also carry out the research and gather data. It is helpful to present to citizens a typology of participation to be able to apply
it to their level of organization and adapt it. Organised workshops can involve people in building a mission while visuals can explain
themes in an informed manner. c) Challenges in adopting CS: Generate interest in the public - the BBC and other organisations may
do that easier than smaller ones that do not have such a broad reach. Putting the appropriate context around it is needed to get
richer audiences; use software to scaffold participation and give guidance; get access to general public through campaigns and
volunteering organisations; there is a lack of scientific background to some people who want to do scientific projects, so we should
facilitate that through transdisciplinary work; manage relationships and hierarchies and initiate contact with the appropriate people
to develop projects. d) nQuire: Participants mentoned that nQuire may leverage participation in CS projects by being flexible,
intuitive and easy to use. nQuire can help develop capacity building through tutorials on how to create a mission. Proposed ways to
develop nQuire further: support data analysis practices, translate content to other languages, pathways to participation from
exploring to experimenting and taking part. e) Impact of workshops to build CS capacity: contributes to initiating discussions on the
big questions, on the topics that the public wants to research, they are organic because they can bring academia and society
together, help translate complex topics in a user-friendly way, a way to help the public generate ideas themselves because mostly
academics are those who come up with ideas.

Participants who reported learning from taking part in the Climate Change and You mission, they stated: a) awareness of possible
links between climate change, well being, and ways of living: &quot;It is bringing to my attention the possible link between personal
propensity to worry or feel down, the ability to engage in environmentally significant behaviours, and the ability and drive to think
and talk about the issue.&quot; b) awareness and recognition of feelings about climate chage, or being anxious in general: &quot;It made me
stop and think about the overwhelmingly negative attitudes and feelings I have about climate change - I realised I do not tend to
feel inspired, active, or determined - but perhaps these are important feelings to cultivate.&quot; c) reflection on one own's lifestyle
choices and how willing they are to make changes: &quot;That I am not as green as I like to think I am&quot;; &quot;Become more aware of how my
daily activities may relate to climate change and whether I would be willing to make changes to that&quot;, d) the importance of working
with others to battle climate change, or that others are also concerned about similar issues, e) taking action after completing the
survey: &quot;The number of questions about thinking through from different perspectives reinforced my wish to interact with others via
Friends of the Earth and Climate Action groups.&quot; f) awareness that there is interdisciplinary interest about climate change: &quot;That
there is a growing interdisciplinary outlook on climate change and how it impacts our everyday - this is really important and hopefully
will empower groups to participate in change&quot;.",,"60000e146b77a4.15202297","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=60000e146b77a4.15202297&grantRef=BB%2FT019271%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/T019271/1","B5FAC90C-1C0B-42F2-AAC1-B2DA01587C65","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","89E6D9CB-DAF8-40A2-A9EF-B330A5A7FC24","4794EB9F-E29A-4D7E-9DFF-2025C6E1FDAC"

This shift has potential to create sustainable livelihoods for boatbuilders beyond the life of the projects. New orders have already come in. The projected growth in the use of traditional boats will also have a direct environmental benefit by reducing the pollution, erosion and noise impact resulting from the use of motorboats for Marsh tourism. On a broader level, the project plays a role in cultural and environmental advocacy, using an iconic traditional watercraft to bring attention to the challenges of the rural economy and environment, and to the opportunities that Iraq's distinctive heritage can contribute towards in sectors such as tourism, sports and leisure, arts and design.

Hydrogen is an energy option that can help with the process of decarbonisation, especially for those sectors whose energy needs cannot be readily met through electrification (such as industrial processes and domestic heating). 
 Hydrogen presents many opportunities for these purposes; it can be used as fuel for heat, transport, a vector for energy storage, a feedstock into industrial processes and as an alternative fuel, which will increase the resilience of our energy system.
The note also mentions:
UKRI investments remain critical to driving cutting-edge research into the technical challenges surrounding hydrogen production, supply and storage
Perhaps best of all 'storage' occurs all through the document. BGS has certainly pushed this so a good outcome.
The report mentions
The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund provides an opportunity to support R&amp;D that investigates and demonstrates ways to improve the supply and use of clean hydrogen at scale. It could also be extended to a range of large-scale hydrogen storage methods, include pressurised underground stores of hydrogen and modifying current ammonia storage and supply capability, as well as hydrogen transporters.","https://committees.parliament.uk/work/890/the-role-of-hydrogen-in-achieving-net-zero/","6027dfefe36de4.49281756","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=6027dfefe36de4.49281756&grantRef=bgs06001","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=bgs06001","02231342-70D0-44AA-AFC1-F4FF04ED76FD","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","7ADE0AB2-1050-4241-987D-F3B1C3322E05","41E8B70F-403B-4DAF-904A-0AE70E462725"

This Vision is aligned to the UK Government's ambition to encourage innovation and inclusion so people and nature are at the heart of how we design, build, operate and use our existing built environment.","https://indd.adobe.com/view/f2092c85-cd16-4186-9035-e2a63adc2bf9","622facc54e1df7.73964963","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=622facc54e1df7.73964963&grantRef=EP%2FI019308%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I019308/1","B97CE484-2FEB-4080-87E8-69FD9DAF2896","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","2A915F85-5B36-43DB-B608-B5600C68BE24"

International Symposia for Next Generation Infrastructure (ISNGI) (11/09/2017 to 13/09/2017)","Influenced training of practitioners or researchers",,"Multiple continents/international","Conference overview: Next generation infrastructure (NGI) systems need to be conceived, designed and created, operated, maintained, regulated and governed with sustainability and resilience to system problems as core objectives. Furthermore, a similar approach is needed for the management and maintenance of existing infrastructure systems, which provide the context from which the NGI needs to grow; i.e., we need to develop and complement and/or progressively replace our existing infrastructure systems.
This year's ISNGI will bring together the best and sharpest minds from industry, government and academia to help commence this co-ordinated global infrastructure research program, focussed on long term infrastructure and land use planning, and to create not only best practice benchmarks but new knowledge to better inform strategies for long term prosperity.

Jim Hall, Director of the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, and Principal Investigator for DAFNI, said, &quot;The workshop was a significant milestone for the DAFNI delivery programme. We have made a lot of progress since the launch event last July, having almost completed the requirements specification for DAFNI. The workshop demonstrated that the user community has growing confidence in our approach to dealing with security and licensing.&quot;

Dr Erica Yang, STFC's leader of the DAFNI programme, said &quot;The success of this event gives the early demonstration of the strength and capability of STFC Scientific Computing in constructing and delivering a large scale complex data analytics facility. The level of responses from the participants, including academia, public sector, and industry, sends us a clear signal that the community oriented co-design and co-development approach we are undertaking is of crucial importance to address the highly complex and rapidly evolving research challenges of urban infrastructure modelling and simulation community&quot;

Geoff McBride, STFC's theme leader of Global Food Security and Agri-Tech and STFC representative in the UK Water Partnership, said, &quot;I'm very inspired by the project and am happy to advocate where ever I can. This is a rapidly expanding area in data intensive science within STFC, for supporting and empowering next generation multi-disciplinary research communities of crucial importance for the future of our nation.&quot;

STFC's Sam Chorlton, who is the DAFNI Technical Architect, said, &quot;This event demonstrated a shared knowledge and appreciation of the complexities of problems that DAFNI undertakes. It was a good platform for engaging with potential future stakeholders.&quot;

&quot;The Green Estate Strategy incorporates three elements:
 
1. Placeshaping - A master plan identifying opportunities to enhance urban ecology and create a constellation of exemplary connected green space,
2. Placekeeping - A green infrastructure toolkit incorporating a Landscape Management Plan, Tree Strategy and estate wide habitat management guidance,
3. Place living - A Living spaces blueprint setting out how high quality green spaces will help to animate the estate through community interaction; connecting people to nature as well as promoting a healthy environment.
 
As a summary our future vision would be: Mayfair and Belgravia are two of the greenest neighbourhoods in central London. The Estate is characterised by thriving trees, planting and high quality open spaces. This has been achieved by adopting a long-term approach and through planning on a district-wide scale. The Estate's natural environment is cherished by residents and visitors, complementing its exceptional buildings. There are large green spaces open for public use, providing a focal point for neighbourhood activity. The Estate has become a beacon of environmental excellence. It has a network of green corridors including pocket parks, rain gardens, green walls and green roofs, using the natural environment to enrich local ecology and enhance the experience of the Estate&quot;.",,"58c65d1f8e4ab4.23328440","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=58c65d1f8e4ab4.23328440&grantRef=ES%2FK007610%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/K007610/1","0A75F432-52BD-430D-B467-EA033193C0B5","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","9508BB99-A885-4FEF-9582-F334F9D7C2BD"

Dear Professor Christine Oughton, 
CSC Welcome Event for Scholars 2019 
I am writing to thank you for your invaluable contribution to our Welcome Event for Scholars last week. 
The CSC Welcome Event is a highlight of our calendar, giving us the opportunity to bring together all the Commonwealth Scholars studying across the UK. As you will be aware, Commonwealth Scholarships empower individuals to make change in their home countries and beyond - and an important element for us is prompting Scholars to think about the grand challenges of our time, and how to tackle them. 
Your participation in the panel on the climate crisis was a key part of the day - both thought provoking and constructive. Through sharing your expertise and engaging with the Scholars in debate, you inspired them to consider how they can apply the insight they gained to their home countries. From conversations with Scholars I met on the day, I know that they deeply appreciated your input. 
Thanks once again for taking the time to be part of our event, and for helping to make it such a success. 
Yours sincerely

Preparing for Catastrophe: Climate-resilient infrastructure systems National infrastructure systems are characterised by growing complexity and interdependencies between different networks e.g. energy, transport and digital networks. These interdependencies can exacerbate the possibility of cascading failures, where failure in one location can propagate to disproportionately large numbers of infrastructure users. The UK Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC) has developed methodology for mapping interdependencies in large spatially distributed networks and modelling the consequences of cascading failure, in order to identify and prioritise vulnerabilities in the network. We have proposed a definition of 'critical infrastructure hotspots' and have mapped these hotspots for the UK. We are modelling the potential impacts on the wider economy of infrastructure failures and are using the evidence to prioritise interventions to reduce the risks of infrastructure failure.

flooding and water scarcity. Jim Hall is a member of the UK independent Committee on Climate Change Adaptation. In 2010 Jim was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering &quot;for his contribution to the development of methods for flood risk analysis, which underpin approaches for flood risk management in the UK and internationally.&quot; He sits on the Public Voice Committee of the Institution of Civil Engineers and was a member of the panel conducting the Institution of Civil Engineer's 2014 State of the Nation Infrastructure assessment and the Executive Group for the National Needs Assessment - A Vision for UK Infrastructure. Until 2015 Jim Hall was co-chair of the Global Water Partnership / OECD Task Force on the Economics of Water Security and Sustainable Growth. He advises the World Bank on water security and is editor of the AGU journal Water Resources Research. Jim leads the UK Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium, which has developed the world's first national infrastructure simulation models for appraisal 
of national infrastructure investment and risks. His book &quot;The Future of National Infrastructure: A System of Systems Approach&quot; was published by Cambridge University Press in 2016. He sits on the Expert Advisory Group for the National Infrastructure Commission and Chairs the DAFNI Data and Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure.

- Academic expert workshop on 18 June with a select group of ca. 10 academics providing evidence on a number of specific subjects and questions. RRfW's recommendations, in particular around the valuation of resources, were included in the memo following this workshop. 
- Numerous email communications in which we provided additional evidence such as via our Policy and Practice Notes and publications from across our projects. We also influenced the strategy via the Defra waste statistics group and publically at policy events.
- RRfW was invited for a roundtable meeting with the Defra team who was writing the strategy, offering the opportunity to directly discuss our recommendations in depth. 
- Contributed to meeting on 'Targets, Metrics and Monitoring needs for the Resource and Waste strategy'. 

The strategy reflects the RRfW narrative at various points in the document, and directly cites three of our publications and reports.

An extensive list of indicators developed under the Belmont Project was shared with the post-graduate students at UCL part of BENV0075 module to help them develop a comprehensive combination of indicators that would be relevant to monitor national circumstances under their island case study. We focus on Small Islands Developing States as per SDGs knowledge platform list. The exercise supported the postgraduate students and phd students (30) to draw upon three major international frameworks - SDGs, Climate Adaptation and Sendai Framework - to develop their set of indicators and learn how indicators provide quantifiable evidence of impacts, progress and performance towards sustainability, disasters risk reduction and climate change adaptation, applied to the context of their islands. The groups were split according to levels of economic development of the different islands, so that further comparisons could be driven between their reporting on national circumstances. Students analysed the common themes emerging from their case studies, so that indicators could selected for these specific themes as a team effort. In the third and last round, the students developed the list of indicators for their individual case studies, so that further comparison could be driven when split into groups for discussions. Conclusions considered that many national circumstances are not reporting on aspects that students thought would be relevant in light of indicators, while others found that planning and policies analysed at country level consider strategies that are not well reflected in the latest versions of national circumstances. From a research perspective, the students helped us identify some indicators that are potentially missing from our list, most specifically in relation to sectors, so that resource nexus are captured accordingly. In conclusion, the session supported training and enhanced the post-graduate student's knowledge about the following aspects: (i) how to develop a set of indicators by drawing on the SDGs, Sendai and CCA frameworks by first considering information that is already being gathered under national circumstances; (ii) Indicators describing a relation between disaster risk reduction, sustainability and climate change adaptation; (iii) differences between global, national and local indicators","https://www.islandslaboratory.com","604a0ebb340df6.63115351","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=604a0ebb340df6.63115351&grantRef=EP%2FV002945%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/V002945/1","D9B41B95-86E0-4E84-A14A-6BA78CB49F35","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","00C18981-2D07-42E1-8DC4-B2DBBE4E41EF"

It provides numerical and graphical outputs, including estimated numbers of cyclists in an area, along straight 'desire' lines and along routes. 4.10 Using the 2011 Census Journey to Work data, the PCT can assist with the preparation of LCWIPs at a number of different stages, including: • planning the cycle network: - mapping trip origins and destinations (trip generation) - identifying desire lines for cycle trips (trip distribution) - allocating trips to specific routes (trip assignment) • defining potential demand for cycling across the geographical area covered by LCWIPs, under different scenarios • assisting with scheme prioritisation 15 4.11 The PCT will be of particular assistance in defining potential demand for cycling, identifying the most promising routes and areas for investment, and estimating future capacity needs for route and area-based measures. 4.12 Further information about the application of the Propensity to Cycle Tool can be found in Annex A.

The PCT is a freely-available online resource that has been designed to help with the strategic planning of cycling networks. 4.9 The tool comprises an interactive map that shows the current and potential future distribution of commuter cycling trips under different potential future growth scenarios. It provides numerical and graphical outputs, including estimated numbers of cyclists in an area, along straight 'desire' lines and along routes. 4.10 Using the 2011 Census Journey to Work data, the PCT can assist with the preparation of LCWIPs at a number of different stages, including: • planning the cycle network: - mapping trip origins and destinations (trip generation) - identifying desire lines for cycle trips (trip distribution) - allocating trips to specific routes (trip assignment) • defining potential demand for cycling across the geographical area covered by LCWIPs, under different scenarios • assisting with scheme prioritisation 15 4.11 The PCT will be of particular assistance in defining potential demand for cycling, identifying the most promising routes and areas for investment, and estimating future capacity needs for route and area-based measures. 4.12 Further information about the application of the Propensity to Cycle Tool can be found in Annex A.

He also uses it in one- to-one sessions with current tenants on menu design and kitchen organisation, and he reports that the tool and process help him with this. One notable success is a county pub with a very traditional menu. Although initially sceptical, the tenant agreed to try separating and measuring food waste, as in the trailblazer pubs during the project. During the first week of measuring the pub was throwing away as much as 21.50 kilos of food per day. Between week one and week four, total waste reduced by 33% with an estimated annual saving of &pound;3,062 on food purchase. Gross profit is up by an estimated 5-6% and the tenant estimates that around 2.5% of this can be attributed to better controlling waste through monitoring.

The INCUT network reflected critically on a decades work undertaken by a wide range of scholars across disciplines and urban contexts in the north and south concerned with analysing and in some cases shaping urban transitions. Our collective analysis is designed to inform a wider research and policy debate about the potential and limits of low carbon urbanism. Advancing an understanding of low carbon urbanism requires a shift from an 'extractive' model of low carbon transitions, where the focus is in measuring and reducing emissions, to an 'embedded' model of decarbonisation based on systemic change. There are 3 key findings:

1. Urban Low Carbon as Development Mode: The framework proposes a novel interpretation of low carbon transitions as primarily social, political and developmental processes. This suggests that low carbon transitions go beyond simple municipal efforts aimed at measuring and mitigating greenhouse gases, reinterpreting the low carbon transition as a matter of development modes. The first generation of transition studies approached low carbon as a matter of techno-economic innovation, often paying limited attention to the materiality of the city and the socio-political nature of its infrastructural flows. This framework examines the multiple competing ways of designing and practicing low carbon urbanism, and asks what does it mean to be low carbon, what and who is involved in the transition, how is this transition likely to unfold and how would we recognize a transition when we see it. 

2. Critical Role of Low Carbon Intermediaries: Governing low carbon in the city transcends the local arena, involving a broad range of agents beyond the municipality. Non-state actors from private and non-profit sectors are increasingly playing a greater role in shaping, configuring and contesting climate responses in the city. As multiple agents and organizations get involved in the development of capacity for low carbon, 'intermediation' plays a key role . The framework looks at the broad range of activities that make up low carbon Intermediation, such as management, finance provision, service delivery, consulting and knowledge generation, co-ordination, technology provision, advocacy, lobbying, awareness-raising, dissemination and others. Intermediaries, thus, play a role as brokers, connecting, translating, and facilitating flows of knowledge and other resources, whilst also articulating the options and demands of the different agents involved, supporting the alignment of visions, objectives and possibilities towards common goals .

3. New Forms of Low Carbon Citizenship: Imagining specific types of citizens, and through this endowing them with specific powers, is of relevance for the reconfiguration of the city within low carbon logics and forms of operation. The creation of citizens that are amenable to the low carbon objective is fundamental to this process. Similarly, collective processes of developing and enacting shared low carbon identities and initiatives bring about new openings for low carbon urbanism, highlighting the significant role of communities within the low carbon transition. The framework examines how different communities of practice transform meanings and forms of relating to the city and its infrastructures in order to reduce their emissions.",,"595a0ef3c11a93.57762724","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=595a0ef3c11a93.57762724&grantRef=ES%2FJ019607%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/J019607/2","8D6D1B6C-B037-4BE6-A57A-E9921911465F","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","6F981688-B7B6-411E-9A94-4EABDE44E690"

I lead the team in London that produced the 2050 London infrastructure plan in 2014 and subsequent updates for which more information can be found here. 
But more specifically, we have been working with an SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) called Greenwood Strategic Advisors to develop a system dynamics based approach to modelling policy and investment decisions in the capital, an approach which the same firm is deploying for Boston and Frankfurt. I thought I'd get in touch to see if there were any resonances with the work that you have been doing work, an overview of which would be much appreciated in any case. 

Response from Professor Jim Hall: 
The approach that we have developed, which is discussed in our book The Future of National Infrastructure, is a combination of: 
1. Systems modelling of infrastructure networks: energy, transport, digital, water, waste, flood risk management
2. Decision analysis to explore the implications of future scenarios (e.g. population growth, climate change) and sequence policies and investments going into the future. 
The first phase of our ITRC research programme focussed at a national scale, and developed the NISMOD model, which is now being used by the National Infrastructure Commission for the National Infrastructure Assessment. We also used NISMOD to inform the National Needs Assessment led by Sir John Armitt. A short paper on that work is attached. 
The current phase of our programme is called MISTRAL and is operating at multiple spatial scales, including the city scale, as well as exploring opportunities to transfer the technologies globally. 
I've interacted with the GLA in a number of different contexts over the years, including in relation to adaptation to climate change, water and flooding. 
I'd be happy to follow up with a telephone conversation or meeting next time I'm in London to explore potential connections with the GLA.

The INCUT network reflected critically on a decades work undertaken by a wide range of scholars across disciplines and urban contexts in the north and south concerned with analysing and in some cases shaping urban transitions. Our collective analysis is designed to inform a wider research and policy debate about the potential and limits of low carbon urbanism. Advancing an understanding of low carbon urbanism requires a shift from an 'extractive' model of low carbon transitions, where the focus is in measuring and reducing emissions, to an 'embedded' model of decarbonisation based on systemic change. There are 3 key findings:

1. Urban Low Carbon as Development Mode: The framework proposes a novel interpretation of low carbon transitions as primarily social, political and developmental processes. This suggests that low carbon transitions go beyond simple municipal efforts aimed at measuring and mitigating greenhouse gases, reinterpreting the low carbon transition as a matter of development modes. The first generation of transition studies approached low carbon as a matter of techno-economic innovation, often paying limited attention to the materiality of the city and the socio-political nature of its infrastructural flows. This framework examines the multiple competing ways of designing and practicing low carbon urbanism, and asks what does it mean to be low carbon, what and who is involved in the transition, how is this transition likely to unfold and how would we recognize a transition when we see it. 

2. Critical Role of Low Carbon Intermediaries: Governing low carbon in the city transcends the local arena, involving a broad range of agents beyond the municipality. Non-state actors from private and non-profit sectors are increasingly playing a greater role in shaping, configuring and contesting climate responses in the city. As multiple agents and organizations get involved in the development of capacity for low carbon, 'intermediation' plays a key role . The framework looks at the broad range of activities that make up low carbon Intermediation, such as management, finance provision, service delivery, consulting and knowledge generation, co-ordination, technology provision, advocacy, lobbying, awareness-raising, dissemination and others. Intermediaries, thus, play a role as brokers, connecting, translating, and facilitating flows of knowledge and other resources, whilst also articulating the options and demands of the different agents involved, supporting the alignment of visions, objectives and possibilities towards common goals .

3. New Forms of Low Carbon Citizenship: Imagining specific types of citizens, and through this endowing them with specific powers, is of relevance for the reconfiguration of the city within low carbon logics and forms of operation. The creation of citizens that are amenable to the low carbon objective is fundamental to this process. Similarly, collective processes of developing and enacting shared low carbon identities and initiatives bring about new openings for low carbon urbanism, highlighting the significant role of communities within the low carbon transition. The framework examines how different communities of practice transform meanings and forms of relating to the city and its infrastructures in order to reduce their emissions.",,"595a0ef3c11a93.57762724","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=595a0ef3c11a93.57762724&grantRef=ES%2FJ019607%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/J019607/1","F4A5C9AE-BDCF-4E57-8A3B-432B28443AC4","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","46B41008-0EB4-4E28-BBFB-E98366999EC5","6F981688-B7B6-411E-9A94-4EABDE44E690"

It is not only an important foundation for the future management and presentation of the abbey's heritage but has demanded follow-through change on site, e.g. better storage of the collections and their and accessibility to visitors and researchers. It has added real weight to the need to upgrade the presentation and on-site interpretation of the monastic buildings above and below ground. The admirable ways in which the project findings have been widely disseminated, including at popular seminars and talks, have proved that it is possible to bridge what can often be a huge gap between scholarly and popular understanding of a place, even at Glastonbury where understanding of, and attachment to the precinct is so diverse.

Traditional approaches to industrial strategy have a sectoral or technology focus. We argue however that the best way for May's government to achieve its economic vision is through a 'mission-oriented' approach that focuses on solving important societal challenges such as; climate change, youth unemployment, obesity, ageing and inequality. Such an approach would require many different sectors to interact with each other in new ways. If used to give direction to Britain's economic growth path, this could generate innovation-led (smart) growth that is both inclusive and sustainable.

Trentmann was invited by the Council to produce an extended version for publication. This publication (Materielle Kultur und Energiekonsum, oekom publishers, Munich 2016) has been circulated to stakeholders with an interest in sustainable development (government ministries, business, sustainability research centres). The Council (RNE) writes (20 Feb 2017): &quot;the statistics for our website (checked 20 Feb 2017) show: after publishing the free PDF of the booklet in November 2016, we mentioned it in our newsletter which goes out to 11,000 readers. Since then, the file/booklet was accessed 13,161 times, a very high number reflecting great interest in the research. From the perspective of the Rat Fuer Nachhaltige Entwicklung (German Council for Sustainable Development), the impact of both Trentmann's lecture and his booklet is that it allows us to bring forward the sustainability debate in a science-politics-interface. Science based policy-making is crucial in order to strengthen sustainable development, and a closer look at the impacts of past decision-making and political programmes as outlined in Trentmann's lecture and booklet sheds light on nexuses that are often overseen in the daily business of politics and any measures to promote sustainable development. As concerns our work at RNE, we make use of any possibility to promote the booklet and to relate the research underpinning it to current debates about sustainability.","https://www.nachhaltigkeitsrat.de/veranstaltungen/veranstaltungen-des-rates/6-c-v-c-vorlesung-03-06-2015/","56d99ad6e55860.10435608","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=56d99ad6e55860.10435608&grantRef=AH%2FK006088%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/K006088/1","D3BE87D5-00DF-48A1-8AC1-5CAF20151A8E","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","3E18DACB-05AA-4C71-88FB-C909A8311BB5","E00FD4A6-B710-4A74-9F4C-F6E0D942806E"

The advice has been covered by international press, including Guardian, Le Monde, Macau Business, Globe and Mail, as well as on Nature. It focuses on transformative change through a variety of inter-linked goals, with action being coordinated at every scale.

Dr Shannon was quoted explaining that &quot;there is no one-to-one linkage from any action target to a specific milestone or goal; instead, 'many-to-many' relationships exist among them.
