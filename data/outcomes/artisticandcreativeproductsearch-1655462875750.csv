Due to the living conditions of the poor, they are often more exposed to hazards, and have fewer options to avoid, or cope with the impacts. As, according to UNDP, more than 70 per cent of the world's poor are female, the share of women among the most vulnerable is dis-proportionably high. Moreover, there are additional factors indicating that vulnerability involves heavy gender differentials that need to be taken into consideration.
At the local level, a range of inequalities and injustices are directly apparent and tangible. In most cities around the world, the divide between the privileged and underprivileged is as large as
the global divide between developed and least developed countries. While a small proportion of citizens claim the major share of land for housing, mobility and recreation, the majority of others are crowded together in slums yet the carbon footprint is mostly caused by the rich with luxurious houses building with concrete and other materials that emit carbon in the air. The size of the carbon footprints of different citizens ranges from very large to virtually zero. The poorest groups, such as slum dwellers, usually have the smallest carbon footprint, and, moreover, they often live in areas most exposed to climate hazards, such as landslide or flood prone areas.
These inequalities are related to income, class, age, race, ethnicity, health status, etc. Within all this inequalities, gender leads to a further differentiation, and in most cases, leads to different impacts of climate change on women and men. Within low-income populations, women often have particular vulnerabilities as a result of gender-related inequalities.
Vulnerability depends on exposure to the negative effects of climate variability, and the capacity to avoid these effects or cope with them. This capacity depends on income, assets, education and knowledge, and here again, there is a gender bias all over the world, and women have lower incomes.
In some countries facing constraints due to cultural patterns and norms, women are responsible for the bulk of unpaid care work. They are responsible for climatically sensitive tasks such as securing food, water and energy which ensures the well-being of a household. When climate related disasters strike the poorest families living in slums, the workload for women and girls increases and they tend to miss out on opportunities.
The effects of climate change such as drought and floods and rising temperatures in the city put greater pressure on women to shoulder the adverse consequences on the household.
The building construction industry too is mostly dominated by men; therefore women have a lower chance of creating solutions to climate change problems that affect them.
The Project
Deriving inspiration from the Northern Ugandan People's way of construction, where families construct their hats next to each other and using mad, I created a modern house with circles inter-connecting with each other from one space to another.
The material and technique used for this sample house is rammed earth (same material that was used to construct the great wall of china, still standing strong) which is stronger, faster, cheaper and more aesthetically pleasing than concrete buildings. Concrete is the most commonly used material in cities yet the most destructive. As a material that creates the majority of the world's bridges, roads, dams, and construction, concrete releases an extreme amount CO2 each year, has a way shorter life span than rammed earth and cannot be recycles. It's the highest consumed product on earth besides water. Until the overall emissions are cut worldwide, the environment will continue to be polluted with over 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually due to this industry. Rammed earth walls are constructed by the compacting (ramming) of moistened subsoil into place between temporary formwork panels. When dried, the result is a dense, hard monolithic wall. A vernacular green building material as well as in more recent 'Eco houses', rammed earth is an ancient form of construction. There remain plentiful examples of the form around the world, evidence that rammed earth is a successful and durable way of building. A few historical rammed earth buildings are to be found in the UK. The green roof on the house has many benefits at economic, ecological and societal levels. A green roof provides ? a rainwater buffer ? purifies the air ? reduces the ambient temperature ? regulates the indoor temperature ? saves energy ? and encourages biodiversity in the city. Green roofs are part of climate-proof construction. Therefore; addressing climate change issues through building and construction will improve on the environment and peoples well-being thus women will be affected less or not at all by the effects of climate change.","Artwork","2021","Building a creative community of practice around climate actions and sustainable architecture in Uganda",,"62286223557f88.44512412","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=62286223557f88.44512412&grantRef=MR%2FS015299%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/S015299/1","C07ABA12-38CD-4110-87F4-80C176EC5254","5807F429-7BF0-4E42-917E-D4ADF5399E7B","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","EECFB85C-8835-4446-A089-B5E71DA0F278"

The Little Earths will be offered to politicians and policy makers over an extended time period who will be tasked to carry them on a daily basis. Custodians will be required to document their reflections in diary form as an affirmation of the conscious care they need to demonstrate for the planet.

But all is not as it seems. As the new Disaster Trade exhibition reveals, the true global impact of the British economy is hidden from observers, but no less destructive for it.

Focusing on imports from Cambodia, Sri Lanka and the South Asian &quot;brick belt&quot;, this exhibition exemplifies how British trade shapes the disasters that afflict the UK's trading partners. 

Drawing on global quantitative data, personal testimonies and professional photography, it exposes how the UK's trade in garments, bricks and tea serves to displace emissions and environmental degradation, whilst intensifying the impacts of natural hazards linked to climate change.

The exhibition in Hanoi was updated with elements of slow design, and the exhibition catalogue was inspired by the research on slow design. 

This is the description that the curator of the art work described: 
The Vietnam pavillion was the only research led and non-profit installation featured in the 2018 Biennale. This exhibition was built on the research conducted by the INCITE group, particularly the emerging research focused on slow design-driven innovation in transitional economies.

The INCITE research group focuses on design, innovation and creativity in economies that are transitioning to creative economies. INCITE research design, innovation and creativity to revitalise underdeveloped areas, and how communities are innovatively reacting to unfavourable conditions by creating economic, social and cultural values. Their research on slow design challenges the current models of production and distribution that have stimulated a culture of overconsumption. This culture is not sustainable and it has contributed to climate change, biodiversity loss, natural resource degradation, ethical issues, poverty, waste, excessive and inefficient energy use and increased the vulnerability of many Developing Nations communities in which the globalised products are manufactured. INCITE believes measures must be taken, slow design-driven innovation answers this challenge and are answers this challenge and are investigating new business models at the time of the Anthropocene.

The following excerpts have been extracted and edited from papers written by Dr Marta Gasparin and supported by Dr William Green and Dr Christophe Shinckus.

What is Slow Design Innovation?
Slow Design Innovation responds to our failing globalised models of production and distribution, that have resulted in a culture of overconsumption, an economic system that is not sustainable, and, of grave concern, is anthropogenically endangering planetary sustainability. The current system is responsible for climate change, biodiversity loss, natural resource degradation, ethical issues, and increased the vulnerability of many developing communities. Recent research on business model innovation, ecosystems and platforms have underlined the variety of configurations, roles and strategic positioning in contemporary industry but also the need for ecosystems to evolve to address contemporary common threats such as climate change and environmental issues. 

What impact can Slow Design have?
As a response to the failure of these current global systems INCITE have conducted ethnographic studies among designers in Vietnam to understand their design processes. Slow Design Innovation proposes an alternative economic system which responds to current practices that negatively impact on environment and society. The aim of Slow Design Innovation is to have a process that produces high-quality new products and services and at the same time reduces the exploitation of natural and human resources, celebrates their value, and increases the lifespan of products based on quality and local traditions, which confronts the current paradigm of &quot;more and cheaper is better&quot;.

Slow Design - Organising Nature Through Technologies of Craft
The role of cutting edge, hi-tech innovations in organisations is a common topic for research. Alongside these studies, there has been a more muted development of writing on the role of mundane material things in ordinary, everyday and pervasive forms of organising. INCITE's research argues that these mundane matters, are increasingly central to concerns over sustainability and they have been central to our ethnographic research in a remote village in Vietnam. Here craft and its mundane technologies play an important role in organising nature. With the significant and immediate threat posed by climate change as a pressing backdrop, INCITE's research aims to investigate: how can the organisation of mundane material things and organisation through mundane material things change in order for nature to be organised? INCITE explores the mundane material things involved in craft work, set against the rapid destruction of nature in Vietnam. 

The sustainable craft work that INCITE's research explores, sits in the shadow of rapid and large scale transformation of the environment. Vietnam is interesting because it operates as a nexus for rapid change and questions of sustainability that emerge through concerns for development-at-speed. Not only a location for traditional, arguably sustainable, craft enterprises. This nexus of change, destruction and sustainability provides a coherent geographical location for witnessing struggles over mundane and pervasive material things that raise startling questions for the future of the planet. 

Amongst this rapid transformation craft skills are re-emerging as a way to define identity, culture and aspirations. What is required to sustain craft, and to sustain the environmental practices are different means to organise nature. Distribution of smaller scale needs to take shape, designers researched think that this can be achieved by takintraditional Vietnamese craft work to the world. The designers must act as pioneers of sustainability and use careful agricultural practices, craft skills, and small scale production to recruit new audiences; to go and talk about, write about, set demands for and make orders for craft workers' produce. They must take the nature of craft work to the world. This is not a marketing gimmick, an empty gesture to reassure the environmental concerns of mass consumers. The craft skills and tools are reliable material witnesses, carrying with them and speaking of their natural location, their Vietnamese roots. The nature they represent (of sustainable craft work and its careful agriculture) has been re-organised: it now begins to operate in new locations, among new audiences on a global stage. So the scales begin tip somewhat. Their balance shifts. In place of the demarcation between the global flows of capital that underpin the rapid and huge material saturation of the environment through tourism on one side and the small, mundane, local, marginalised craft workers on the other, a new demarcation is appearing. On the one side, traditional craft as representative of a sustainable future in which we all ought to have a stake - with new supporters recruited among journalists and designers - and on the other, a rampant and irresponsible capitalism that we ought to avoid. The designers, the craft workers, their tools and their process are making moves. They are shifting cosmopolitics through their re-organisation of nature.

Written by Ann Grace Apiita, Christine Akello Opat, Eric Emokor. In the drama synopsis attached, the initial focus is on the location, and the livelihood of the characters and how these components intensify climate change and other environmental issues. Most communities around the Lake Kyoga region in Apac district, other surrounding districts and even across Kampala (the capital city of Uganda) have built their houses on wetlands. The locals continue to carry out farming and agricultural practices on fragile ecosystems like wetlands and destroying forests to meet fuel needs. The destruction and mismanagement of wetlands therefore, (partly due to inadequate knowledge of the local communities) has impacted on biodiversity: loss of birds, fish, insects, plant species among other factors, and worsened climate change impacts for example, with the floods that eventually claimed the lives of the locals depicted in the drama.

Secondly, the social fabric, culture and gender disparities are demonstrated right from many households, and diverse institutions that promote patriarchal systems, not only in the northern region but all regions across Uganda. From the family unit, the male species are exposed to so many opportunities such as education, career development, political/leadership, economic prospects - ownership of land and other assets unlike their female counterparts.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, cases of gender-based violence also increased substantially and it stems from gender disparities that grow right from families and flow into communities and eventually institutions. Although the two journalists arrived in the Luo community of Apac, to cover news of the devasting floods that claimed the lives of the locals, they equally played a key role in dismantling the gender inequality toward the girl child. This is demonstrated by their determination and courage to challenge intergenerational cultural norms and promote conversations about supporting the education of the vulnerable girl child instead of the social arrangements that were made by the clan elders to betroth her to a wealthy village clan chief. It resulted into the girl child becoming an instrumental social agent of change in her school.

Lastly, the initiative highlights the dangers of using Kerosene for lighting and cooking. Generally, the unsustainable use of coal, oil and gas through human-driven activities globally have led to the adverse impacts of climate change that are experienced currently. In most rural and urban communities in Uganda, like in Kampala, charcoal/fuelwood is consumed highly by households, learning institutions among others. For lighting houses, some communities still use dirty and poisonous sources of fuel such as Kerosene yet inhaling the smoke and soot produced causes pulmonary heart and lung diseases hence a health danger to communities. 
Other dangers caused using Kerosene include destruction of houses, property if not monitored well - an example is the destruction of the kitchen that belonged to the guardian of the orphaned children who lived in Kampala city. 
Therefore, the drama advocates for the use of renewable energy sources and technologies such as solar lamps or lighting appliances which are clean, accessible, sustainable, and affordable to low-income communities whether in rural or urban communities. The use of clean energy helps substantially in mitigating climate change and supporting communities to cope with climate change and environmental impacts. In addition, encouraging initiatives such as entrepreneurship opportunities as well as football for environmental advocacy or climate change mitigation are prioritized.

In conclusion, the advocacy project responds to all the themes of climate change, environmental issues, gender, life in cities as elaborated above.","Creative Writing","2021","An ongoing relationship and development of community of practice around climate change awareness and actions in Uganda.",,"622860a4e4fb11.71351043","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=622860a4e4fb11.71351043&grantRef=MR%2FS015299%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/S015299/1","C07ABA12-38CD-4110-87F4-80C176EC5254","5807F429-7BF0-4E42-917E-D4ADF5399E7B","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","EECFB85C-8835-4446-A089-B5E71DA0F278"

Carbon emissions are a key determinant of global temperature, sea level, ocean oxygenation state and acidity, and hence of the biosphere; the carbon dioxide factor has a long track record of causing planetary change, and the current trajectory is at the extreme end of things. Then (among many other factors), there are all those human-made novelties, such as the evolution of the elaborately engineered, energy-hungry technology that keeps us alive. The technosphere, it has been called. It is an offshoot of the biosphere, and is showing signs of taking on a life of its own or, in the language of science, of acting as an emergent system with its own dynamics. 

Geologically, the Earth is still in a rapidly evolving transitional phase towards whatever it will end up becoming, centuries and millennia and, yes, millions of years from now. We are living on the cusp of change. Given the rate of change, and the likely extent of the difference between the Earth states before and after - another geological analogy comes to mind. The next generation, on current trends will see them well on their way to disappearance through acidification, warming, over-fishing and pollution. This is a large, abrupt geological change that we happen to be in the middle of (and that, in theory, we still have some control over). 
The Anthropocene's significance is cosmic, because we know our planet, in possessing complex life, is a rarity in the Universe that is likely in many senses to be truly unique. Contemplation of three thousand generations of human history into the future does not come naturally to a species designed for life as a hunter-gatherer, nor does the idea that a computer, or a car, or a bullet, is in essence a geological object. How may this affect the Earth itself, though? We hold different personal perspectives on time, space and process. These are represented in the Anthropocene Square metre. 
A square metre of the Earth represents in microcosm the human-driven changes to the surface of our planet. The Earth as a whole has an area, land surface and sea floor combined, of some 510 million kilometres. In metres that is therefore 510 trillion - or 510 000 000 000 000 - square metres. 

Selecting just one of those square metres, as planetary representative, we can then take the ingredients of our constructions, and put them on to our square metre in approximate proportion to their amount on the whole Earth. That, then, might give an idea of how much the Earth has changed.

Our bulk components are a little more than half is the material we have assembled into our towns and cities, and most of that is the rubble and reworked rock and soil upon which their foundations are built. A little under a third comprises the soils of our croplands and pastures, now subsumed as part of our life support system. A little under a tenth is the submarine soils that we plough through sea floor trawling: wet sea floor mud, churned over, and depleted both in clay (that, disturbed by the trawling, has drifted off to the deep ocean floor). Small chips of rock and dirt, tiny wood fragments and puddles of water can represent our mine and quarry waste, roads and railways, by plantations and reservoirs (both water and sediment).","Artefact (including digital)","2019","Displayed at the university and in the city centre to raise awareness on climate change",,"5dbec7f427bfb5.48666402","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5dbec7f427bfb5.48666402&grantRef=ES%2FS006060%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/S006060/1","FFE08808-7471-4900-833E-EFBB5D808570","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","C842A34F-18F7-454D-A259-FED802368496","D10B0737-7E27-4C0B-9CEF-072E18EA2E63"

This is an update of emissions of carbon dioxide and where they go in the environment.

Meanwhile global emissions from burning fossil fuels have soared 2.5% pear year on average, continuing to load the atmosphere with greenhouse warming gas.&quot; Corinne Le Quere

This below is one of a series of three images commissioned to accompany the 2014 Global Carbon Budget Report, which is published today - right now, in fact. Among other things the report outlines the planet's carbon emissions over the last year and the implications for both society and the climate.

The images constitute somewhat of an experiment for the team behind the report, as cartoons have not been used to communicate the research before. There's an interesting article here unpicking in more detail what the images represent, and also discussing the potential for cartoons to provide an effective alternative/complement to diagrams as a means of communicating complex ideas in simplified form. In fact, if you follow the link you are also invited to offer your own thoughts on whether you feel the experiment has worked So do cartoons have a place in scientific research? What might they offer that diagrams can't, and vice versa?

Art installation British Antarctic Survey and Arup Architects","Arup presents Ice Floor, a new Phase 2 commission about climate change that has been developed by UK born artist Wayne Binitie in collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey, a world leading centre for polar science. 

Since 1979 summer sea-ice extent in the Arctic has reduced at 10% per decade. Some major glaciers that drain the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets have accelerated by as much as 50%, adding to sea level rise.

The installation explores the vulnerability of these regions to global warming and how they are subject to conditions like 'calving' (large chunks of ice breaking away at random moments).

Deep ice cores from the polar regions have revealed more about the link between climate change and the atmosphere than any other scientific technique. In a cold room, specially created for the exhibition, slices taken from Antarctic ice cores appear to float on a solid ice floor.

The exhibition has been made possible through collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey and the kind support of ISOVER.","Artwork","2019","The Ice Floor art installation comprised 360 discs, each 100 mm diameter and 20mm thick, of ancient Antarctic ice cores placed on a 2 meter diameter slab of frozen water in a dark and sound-proofed room, kept at -5 degrees Celsius, situated in the reception area of Arup Architects in London. The slab of ice was lit from below to cast an eerie light into the darkened room. Speakers set into the concrete floor projected the sounds of pre-industrial air being released from ice cores, which tell us the levels of greenhouse gases in the past.

The exhibition was open to the public, with free access.

Political Atmospherics describes series of physical models and animations that can either be installed together or as individual pieces. The works employ climate model data which we propose as a proto planetary archive which can reveal the processes of energy exchanges that compose the atmosphere alongside the socio-technical systems refiguring it and the weather. 

In this respect, we consider the atmosphere as a nebulous commons, transformed by extractivist acts of enclosure that dissipates and reforms as a material record of our cultures, behaviours and histories. This collision of the sensory and the political occurs across huge scales, connecting geo-chemical structures and processes; mineral and fossil necro-deposits; carbon industries; petroleum-states; infrastructures; pipelines and commerce. 

The work consists of the following:



Over 20 models of various sizes, several animations, drawings and other physical outputs: 

Necrotopologies

Necrotopologies are a series of physical models extruding carbon data into three-dimensional maps that interweave the many sources of anthropogenic carbon production. Produced from FDM and SLS large format 3D printers they depict over multiple spatial and temporal scales, carbon flows through fossil fuel extraction, energy, the manufacture of materials, transportation, travel and food production.

In the context of the exhibition topic these processes might be considered as 'engines' that are re-making our planetary atmospheric systems. The models how the global economy global economy since the 1970s.

This podcast is hosted by Jamaican journalist Paula-Anne Porter Jones, in conversation with co-directors of the Caribbean Resilience and Recovery Knowledge Network (CRRKN) Emily Wilkinson from ODI, and Donovan Campbell from The University of the West Indies.
Episode 1 Education: The volcanic crisis in Montserrat (1995-97) interrupted education with long-term effects on young people, but important lessons were learned that can help educators and governments around the world respond to Covid-19. Crises will become more frequent in the future, so how can we adapt our education systems? 
Episode 2 Climate Justice: Dominica has lived through increasingly intense hurricanes and was devastated by Hurricane Maria (2017), which laid bare vulnerabilities that date back to colonial decisions. For Dominica and all Caribbean islands, colonisation and climate change have, and will continue to have, damaging consequences. So, do we now need 'climate justice'? 
Episode 3 Resilient Economies: The long-term economic impacts of Hurricane Gilbert (1988) in Jamaica reveal a lack of attention to disaster risks in planning decisions, and even deficiencies in the way economics is being taught. How far have economic models and national planning systems in the Caribbean come since the 1980s? 
Episode 4 Leaving No One Behind: During a crisis, politicians will say 'we are all in the same boat', but are we? Disasters can deepen inequalities, and the case of Haitian migrants in the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian is a stark example of this. But disasters also shine a light on problems and create opportunities for change. 
Episode 5 A Future by the Sea: Caribbean island coastlines have changed beyond recognition, and ecosystems and livelihoods are under threat. But advances in nature-based solutions and calls for a 'green recovery' from the Covid-19 pandemic provide hope and a vision for a more resilient future in the Caribbean.","Film/Video/Animation","2021","The podcast has been well received by audiences in the Caribbean, shared by CREAD in Dominica, and received praise from the head of communications, who said 'everyone interested in sustainability, climate change or disaster risk management in the Caribbean should listen to this'.","https://shows.acast.com/caribbean-comeback/episodes/a-future-by-the-sea","6227711562dbc7.39661642","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6227711562dbc7.39661642&grantRef=NE%2FS006443%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/S006443/1","1FEA626F-691A-44FF-89AD-A653505E30DA","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","C3FA5CCF-C8C0-4250-96AE-C676B53492A7","C32654CE-30D9-4CB0-B357-498457B8121B"

Each one was either species rich or poor with picture of flowers on one side, pollinators on the other and bamboo canes connecting them. Balls representing ecosystem services (e.g. pollination) were poured in the top and supported by the interactions/canes. Participants could remove links to see the effect (i.e. the balls would fall in the species poor system faster and the system would be driven to collapse much easier - it was less robust). We could show the effect of damaging the habitat (removing all the links to certain flowers) or the loss of pollinators (removing the links from the other side) and show how the two are inherently reliant on each other. We could then get participants to build the system back up again and decide when it was likely to be stable as well as which one would support more pollination.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2016","Children of all ages really seemed to engage with this method of explaining the importance of maintaining interactions as well as species.

Cupsy was installed in Heathrow Terminal 5 for 4 weeks to compare its performance with previous recycling rates at the same location.

Then, the child shows how rubbing the fish on sand removes the scales. The fish is then washed in clean water and it's ready to be cooked.

The dhaqan collective is a feminist art collective of Somali women, centering the voices of womxn and elders in our community, and privileging co-creation and collaboration.

This project will focus on finding new ways to combine sound with physical 'woven' artefacts to create audible tapestries.

Creative ecology is rooted in the collective thinking of Somali nomadic life and creativity is at its heart. In the last few decades, Somali nomadic life has become endangered due to environmental collapse which is fueled by an extractive capitalism that benefits the global north.

Dhaqan Collective want to learn sustainable weaving methods in order to maintain the endangered traditions of Somali nomadic life. Additionally, sourcing sustainable materials that are available locally which will be used during the tapestry making process. They are aware of the high levels of carbon emissions associated with the textile industry and would like to approach this project with the mindset of preemptively reducing or eliminating a carbon footprint.

This project will be tying together the Collective's ongoing work in storytelling, soundscapes and combining it with Somali weaving practices.","Artefact (including digital)","2022","Project in progress","https://www.dhaqan.org/","622b34e7a65ab2.85229778","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=622b34e7a65ab2.85229778&grantRef=AH%2FS002936%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/S002936/1","92A196F0-EB8D-457B-9FC6-8DC0CA2A2514","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","2A80FFDA-3B8B-43BA-80C3-3AA850B49BA1","B5FCA41E-78FA-4D93-9ED6-622650AA4AC1"

GENERATE invites applicants to submit a piece of artistic work and an accompanying description that explains what inspired the work and how it interprets the theme of &quot;Climate and Gender (In)Justice in the City&quot; in the context of urban Uganda or Indonesia. 
As with most societal injustices, the brunt of climate change is typically bared by women, especially low-income women. Ill placed landfills are a common feature in Ugandan cities, and a visit to one of them reveals that the majority of people that dwell and work there are women and children. The correlation between gender injustice and climate change is not one that's typically highlighted or written about, and I too was surprised to find many women of all ages and young children working in the highly hazardous conditions that are Kampala's landfills. These landfills release large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes towards climate change as well as health problems for those that are overly exposed to it.

I asked this lady (mama Nankya) for permission to photograph her because I believed that her (and other women's) reality in this spaces is an important one to share, talk about and resolve. I'm always interested in combining my artistic skills and activism interests (particularly) for African women and telling the vastly hidden stories is what inspired this piece and the rest in the series. I believe it highlights important realities such as; economic inequality and the growing issue of garbage disposal in our cities and what that means for the environment as well as the people that inhabit it.","Artwork","2021","We have been working in partnership with Aida Namukose to pursue a photographic project to document young women's experiences of climate change through the lens of livliehoods dependent on Lake Victoria.

Story synopsis:

It's 2049 in Colombia. 

Two childhood friends exchange messages across an ideological divide. One now works for the Reserve - a large scale mining operation in the Serran&iacute;a de las Quinchas posing as a conservation project - while the other lives in one of the displaced communities on its fringe.

Based on climate research by teams of experts led by Dr Naomi Milner, Colombian writer and activist Juan C&aacute;rdenas has created a piece of creative writing to communicate the socio-ecological systems within Colombia and their response to environmental change. 
 
This film is part of Hay Festival's Trans.MISSION project, pairing leading researchers with award-winning artists to communicate the latest climate science. New stories are being launched in a series of public events at Hay Festival editions in Peru, Colombia and Wales throughout 2019-20.

Juan C&aacute;rdenas is a writer, creative writing teacher, and activist, who has worked extensively with Afrocolombian and indigenous communities mapping oral traditions. A recent project saw him collaborate with former FARC guerrilla members and community leaders to get them to tell their stories. C&aacute;rdenas is interested in nature and the environment and has campaigned for public policies on the matter in his native Colombia.

Naomi Millner is Lecturer in Human Geography at Bristol University and is working on one of three linked research projects under The Exploring &amp; Understanding Colombian Bio Resources programme. This programme seeks to improve understanding of socio-ecological systems in the Colombian regions of Boyac&aacute; and Cundinamarca, and their response to environmental change, including climate, land use, and social or political change; and the underpinning role and value of biodiversity in these ecosystems.

Development corridors that sustain and conserve nature, and are people-centred, would have the capacity to create optimal opportunities for, and reduce risks to, sustainable development and societal well-being: Development corridors have the potential to diversify and improve livelihoods by making trade, communications and services more efficient. However, they also pose a real risk of disadvantaging and excluding important stakeholders who might not have enough capacity to meaningfully participate in corridor planning and implementation processes and defend their interests. To minimise such risks and maximise potential benefits, corridors must be planned and implemented through an integrated approach using sound policies, plans and practices. While achieving economic goals, development corridors need to protect the integrity of ecosystems and biodiversity, and respect and protect the needs, rights and livelihoods of communities from the earliest stages of planning and throughout the implementation of their development activities. Without balancing these different development and sustainability priorities, it will not be possible to coherently deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals.","Film/Video/Animation","2021","Raising profile of project and impacts of and solutions for development corridors.

This film is designed to highlight the unequal, power-laden relations through which waste circulates, and to offer insight into an industry that is often out of sight. Drawing from interviews with a number of different role players within the waste economy, the film highlights different perspectives on waste in order to call attention to some of the central tensions of the industry. The film situates waste management within a city defined by intense inequality and unevenness, highlighting the perspectives of reclaimers who perform much of the necessary collection of recyclables. Current efforts to formalize waste management and recycling initiatives have implications for informal waste pickers or reclaimers, who do much of the primary work with waste in the global south. Our film subsequently highlights the often fraught relationships between waste reclaimers and the formal waste management sector.
The title of the film - Turning Livelihoods to Waste? - is designed to raise a serious of questions about ongoing processes of formalization in the waste sector and the implications for those who currently work in the waste sector. Many who work with waste in South Africa work as waste pickers or reclaimers, and they are often subjected to extremely difficult work conditions. Ongoing attempts to formalize these systems threaten their livelihoods, creating new uncertainties and vulnerabilities. At the same time, there are serious questions about whether reclaimers should be expected to work in dangerous conditions, and what sorts of alternative arrangements may be more just and more ecologically sustainable.","Film/Video/Animation","2019","The film has recently been launched on the Situated UPE Collective website with accompanying resources.

This product is a science and engineering-inspired drama workshop for 3-7 year olds called Life as a Coral. This workshop takes approximately one and a half hours to complete and requires a clear space for children to move around such as a gym hall. Using drama exercises this workshop explores the topics of the coral reefs of Scotland, the scientists and engineers helping them and what they can do themselves to help the environment. By using story and drama as a format the children act out the information as they process it using imaginative play, movement and group-work. Life as a Coral is part of a wider project called Let's Do Engineering through Heriot-Watt University and is designed to get young children to learn about the jobs that engineers play in our world.

It celebrates how the arts and science together can improve our understanding of how to cope and prepare for a natural hazard. It explores the role that cultural responses can play in helping people cope with natural hazards.
The six panels capture the themes that those we interviewed wanted covered. The content of these frames tries to commemorate the past, celebrate the creative response, and act as an educational tool and reminder of how volcanoes behave and how to respond to them.

It celebrates how the arts and science together can improve our understanding of how to cope and prepare for a natural hazard. It explores the role that cultural responses can play in helping people cope with natural hazards.
The six panels capture the themes that those we interviewed wanted covered. The content of these frames tries to commemorate the past, celebrate the creative response, and act as an educational tool and reminder of how volcanoes behave and how to respond to them. Montserrat is nothing if not a musical island so we also added 'Flow'. Flow has &gt; 1,600 LEDs in a column of ever changing light and music. Flow refers not just to the magma, but to story and song, the continuous experience of living with and after the volcano and eruption. Flow is a collaboration with Output Arts who have created a central 'conduit' and associated audio that imagines the link between the seen and the unseen, memories and experiences told and unsaid.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2019","It is on display in the Montserrat National Museum (Little Bay), but can be booked to use and display at cultural and educational events, by community groups, etc. It was also featured in thE Montserrat Literary Festival and will feature in this year's St Patricks Day celebration and during the SHV 25 celebrations.",,"5e62761b391927.74327854","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5e62761b391927.74327854&grantRef=NE%2FJ020052%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/J020052/1","0F6DE0DE-0275-4618-8215-5F9D3CA1589F","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","88C5F7F9-8DCC-41C9-BC4F-F37DA01075C7","7C1A9658-317C-4362-A6E4-30433DCE5FB0"

From Images 01; these are photographs I took of poorly disposed off plastics and other wastes. Clearly disposed into the environment which is clearly an injustice to the climate. This is a common trait in the city of Uganda (reference to an area called Kisuggu-Makindye Division) and you will always find waste in every community. Some communities have their wastes disposed off along the road side even when the authorities have made several attempts to have these wastes collected. I was able to collect the plastics and made an outfit as seen in images 04 and 05. Images 04 &amp; 05 show contemporary fashion work I made with plastics rebelliously worn by a model to create awareness about plastic pollution in my community whilst giving the model a bold and confident look. And image 05 is an interpretation of woman wearing an outfit made with plastics with an illustration of being held captive by the same people who were supposed to protect them. That is how being female feels like in a country like Uganda where several attempts have been made to find for gender equality. We are under the impression that a lot of impact has been made but deep down we all know that woman is still held captive and we are a long way from attaining this equality. Image 02 &amp; 03 are an interpretation of the true beauty of a justified protected climate and a free woman; these images exhibit the beauty of up cycling wastes into other useful accessories i.e. I up cycled plastic lollipop sticks into Earrings that are seen boldly worn in image 03.","Artwork","2021","Development of a community of practice around climate change actions in Uganda.",,"62286133af0be2.51294811","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=62286133af0be2.51294811&grantRef=MR%2FS015299%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/S015299/1","C07ABA12-38CD-4110-87F4-80C176EC5254","5807F429-7BF0-4E42-917E-D4ADF5399E7B","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","EECFB85C-8835-4446-A089-B5E71DA0F278"

Many plastic items are used once and thrown away. As most plastics do not naturally degrade, they remain with us, usually buried in landfill or in the ocean. India generates around 3.4 million tons of plastic per year, of which 60 - 80% is recycled. India therefore boasts one of the highest rates of plastic recycling in the world, but in the absence of a comprehensive municipal waste management policy or state-supported recycling, the circular economy in cities like Mumbai largely relies on the informal self-organisation of the poor, living and working in precarious and risky conditions. 

This short documentary has been produced collaboratively between a team of UK-based researchers and members of ACORN India, using participatory methods. It tells the story of the journeys that waste materials make through the informal recycling industry in Dharavi, Mumbai. It has been produced as part of a follow-on project for impact and engagement, Resources of Hope, funded by AHRC through the Global Challenges Research Fund.

Compound 13 Lab, developed as an unplanned, incidental legacy of the Resources of Hope project, is an experimental design 'anti-lab', located in Dharavi. It explores the problems of waste, work and survival in the 21st Century. Inspired by the 'maker space' movement, the lab is intended to put state-of-the-art technology for design, manufacturing, music and digital media into the hands of Dharavi's young people. 

The film's soundtrack has been collaboratively composed with members of ACORN, using audio recycled and reclaimed from the urban soundscape of the 13th Compound (translation of the lyrics to the songs is available on request). The film is intended to provoke debate about the 'story of waste', challenging received notions of disposable products, materials and people, reflecting on labour, urban inequalities and the 'biopolitics of disposability'.","Film/Video/Animation","2018","The film continues to be screened in conferences, workshops and seminars worldwide as part of the dissemination process for the research project.","https://vimeo.com/277435980","5c8811dbf00b46.85064022","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5c8811dbf00b46.85064022&grantRef=AH%2FP00637X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P00637X/1","20B866B2-A439-41B1-AA51-57BF44EC0091","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","D60C85C3-0343-430E-81C7-B04058A4B1DF","E414F3AE-62C9-4D31-99D1-4E25D778669E"

In this case, the aim is to sustainably manage marine fauna and flora.

The team consisted of a scientist from our team (Lipson), an artist (Reasor) and an outreach specialist (Erickson) of Inupiat heritage from a village in Alaska. We worked with four 5th grade classes of about 25 students each at Fred Ipalook Elementary in Utqiagvik, AK. The scientist gave a short lecture about sea ice and climate change in the Arctic, with emphasis on local impacts to hunting and infrastructure (with interjections from the local outreach specialist). We then showed the students a large poster of historical and projected sea ice decline, and asked the students to help us fill in the white space beneath the lines. The artist led the children in making small art pieces that represent things that are important to their lives in Utqiagvik (they were encouraged to paint animals, but they were free to do whatever they wanted). We returned to the class later that week and had each student briefly introduce themselves and their painting, and place it to the large graph of sea ice decline, which included the dire predictions of the RCP8.5 scenario. At the end we added the more hopeful RCP2.6 scenario to end on a positive note. The artist then painted in the more hopeful green line by hand.
The result was a poster showing historical and projected Arctic sea ice cover, with 100 beautiful paintings by children of things that are dear to them about their home being squeezed into a smaller region as the sea ice cover diminishes. We scanned all the artwork to make a digital version of the poster, and left the original with the school. These materials are being converted into an interactive webpage where viewers can click on the individual painting for detail, and get selected recordings of the
children's statements about their artwork. This project can serve as a nucleus for communicating to other classes and adults about the real impacts of climate change in people's lives.","Artwork","2019","The predominantly Inupiat people of Utqiagvik, Alaska are among those who will be most impacted by climate change and the loss of Arctic sea ice in the near future. Subsistence hunting of marine mammals associated with sea ice is central to the Inupiat way of life. Furthermore, their coastal homes and infrastructure are increasingly subject to damage from increased wave action on ice-free Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. While the people of this region are among the most directly vulnerable to climate
change, the subject is not often discussed in the elementary school curriculum. Meanwhile, in many other parts of the world, the impacts of climate change are viewed as abstract and remote.

When it Rains, We Harvest (Cuando Llueve, Cosechamos), which has opened at the Scottish Fisheries Museum in Anstruther, has been curated in collaboration with Museum and Gallery Studies MLitt students at the University of St Andrews.
The exhibition draws on the Fen&oacute;meno de Oportunidades 'Phenomenon of Opportunities' international research project.
Led by organisations on the ground in Peru and UK academia, including the University of St Andrews, the project explores how the extreme rainfall caused by this shifting band of warm water in the Pacific Ocean creates fertile land for agriculture and a lake system supporting a fishing industry in Sechura.
The exhibition includes research equipment, objects, photographs and interview extracts from the project.
Visitors will also see archaeological evidence from the Moche and Chimu cultures, modern-day fishing objects and contemporary artwork by Scottish artist Frances Law.
The exhibition concludes with a look at the more recent challenges of climate change faced by fishing communities in both Peru and North East Fife.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2022","only just launched","https://www.scotfishmuseum.org","62309b3e79f409.15934010","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=62309b3e79f409.15934010&grantRef=AH%2FV012215%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/V012215/1","1893F35A-EAF0-43C2-A6AA-0207D8209CFB","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","C0E4FAD2-3C8B-410A-B6DF-3B9B9E433060","7E613E46-4A25-4EDF-B813-BE3C3C305550"

In the 16th century, under the Vijayanagara Empire, Bangalore began to grow into a significant fortified settlement and market town, gaining regional dominance during the British Empire as a military or Cantonment town in the 1700s. While the older trading areas of Bangalore were under the control of the Mysore royal family, the northeastern parts were developed by the British.
 
The patterns of urbanization that emerged under the British and the Mysore royal family continue to echo earlier economic activities as well as the older physical layout and design. Although Bangalore is now a global hub for information technology and biotechnology, it has a long history of manufacturing. Now the fifth largest urban agglomeration in India, its spatial footprint and population has more than doubled since the early 1990s.
 
However, concerns remain about how sustainable or equitable this growth is. Rapid urbanisation, complex land markets, informalisation of work, a growing population, and consequent pressure on Bangalore's physical infrastructure and natural resources have led to serious socio-economic and environmental challenges. Unplanned utilisation of resources is making the city prone to severe water scarcity, as the city continues to grow out in areas where there are serious groundwater deficits.
 
Drawing on research over the last two years, this exhibition charts the journey of a city, from a small trading settlement to contemporary Bangalore. It examines the city's multiple intersecting transitions over the past 150 years, illustrating the changes in its lakes and water bodies, its economic and industrial transition, and the expansion of transport infrastructure.
 
These transitions are layered over Bangalore's physical and spatial features and the city's terrain.
 
This exhibition was completed with support from the KNOW (Grant Ref: ES/P011055/1) and PEAK Urban (Grant Ref: ES/P011225/2) programmes, funded by UKRI's Global Challenge Research Fund.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2020","The purpose was to represent the 450 year history of urbanisation in Bangalore through an equality lens, aimed at university students, public officials and the general public.

Because of the climate crisis and declining ocean health, humans are increasingly in a liminal space between this world and imaginary, alien worlds to come. The poems raise the issue of climate change by foregrounding the centrality, beauty, and significance of the ocean, and of marine life to humanity. They suggest that all species live 'between worlds': between fantasy and reality, dreaming and wakefulness, intuition and consciousness, water and air. We need all worlds to survive. Serendipitously, the poems were composed between dusk and dawn.

Wilson","Along the lines of the theme of the consortium, Matthew and I formulated a project based on the concept of habitable other Earth's. We conducted experiments to simulate to the interior of an Earth-twin exoplanet saturated in carbonic acid. The starting mix was based on a model for the composition of the 'rocky' part of the Earth, known as 'pyrolite'. Pyrolite is a useful model for the composition of the Earth at depths of hundreds of kilometres. As such, this composition allows us to explore, through high pressure and high temperature experiments, the interior of an Earth-like exoplanet. In contrast to the Earth, however, we modified this pyrolite model so that it was saturated in carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is formed by the reaction of H2O with CO2 (water with carbon dioxide). On the surface of the Earth, water dissolves small amounts of carbon dioxide; surface water is very weak carbonic acid. Industrially elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase water acidity, which has severe effects on marine ecosystems. We are literally acidifying the planet we live on. Our model exoplanet explores an extreme outcome of this: an Earth-like planet catastrophically altered by millennia of industrialisation, and saturated in carbonic acid.
The starting mix was prepared by combining powdered oxides, hydroxides and carbonates of various elements. Small amounts of this mix were packed into platinum capsules which were then welded shut. Experiments were performed using a piston-cylinder apparatus at pressures of 2 GPa (approximately 20,000 times atmospheric pressure, equivalent to a depth of approximately 65 km). One experiment was run at 1000 degrees C, and one at 1400 degrees C, both for 48 hours to allow reaction to occur. These temperatures were chosen to investigate 'normal' or 'stable' regions of a planet saturated in carbonic acid, and regions where heating resulted in melting and production of magma, respectively.
 
We saw some really interesting things when we observed the recovered samples using a scanning electron microscope. The lower temperature experiments contain the same combination of minerals we would expect to find at equivalent depth in the Earth, although in a more oxidised form. Pressure promotes formation of carbonic acid. However, at high pressure and temperature this acid oxidises rocks; it literally pumps extra oxygen into the minerals. In some ways this is similar to the use of carbonic acid as a restorative gas (i.e. what you told me about James Watt and his invalid son). The higher temperature experiment has a combination of 'rock' and magma (liquid rock); the conditions we used provide a snapshot of a volcanic process where heat and carbonic acid cause the planet to melt. Once again, carbonic acid has oxidised the material. The magma is quenched to glass imperfectly, so that we capture small crystals starting to form, and bubbles of carbon dioxide forming. Textures suggest that this magma had a very unusual composition; carbonic acid was fully dissolved in the melt, but was slowly released as carbon dioxide and then water as the magma crystallised. 
 
In our hypothetic exoplanet, carbon dioxide and water and forced together deep within the planet to form a highly concentrated acid. However, this acid oxidises the planet, in the same way that iron rusts on the surface of the Earth. Volcanic activity on our exoplanet returns carbonic acid to the surface as both water and carbon dioxide, also producing unusual carbonatite volcanoes, similar to Ol Doinyo Lengai in Tanzania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol_Doinyo_Lengai).","Artwork","2019","-vdrome film &quot;Geological evidences&quot;; this platform provides give high profile to short films; curators include the Tate Modern's film curator: https://www.vdrome.org/matthew-c-wilson

We have golden brown color with few plants, this means that if we become more Mother-Nature-friendly and plant trees even if at least one person can plant one later on our environment can be greener, I reflect on green color on top of brown. Once the environment is green we can face less problems and issues related to the climate change such us disasters.

Behind the green color we see a dark color. That color is small, this means that most people do not give importance to the issue of climate change and do not take it as serious, however the longer they continue to have that mindset the longer the problem of climate change will continue. We shall keep facing serious problems of climate change, air pollution, diseases, and not only will people die because of this, but animals and the beauty of this world will disappear.

The color of gold is big and represents technology. This world is moving very fast and it has a focus on technology which is good, but it should be at the same level as the protection of the environment, which can bring a positive impact upon impacting climate change. But unfortunately, there is often one focus today and it is upon technology.

Today every country wants to have more factories. This has positives and negative consequences. I will give you an example from Kampala, Uganda. The factories there are good for giving people jobs, but they should not be where most people stay. The proximity between these factories and the location's where people live causes respiratory diseases; this can lead to people dying silently as they lack the financial means to prevent the negative consequences of living near these factories that pollute the areas around them.

Another issue is that of automobiles, vehicles, and motorcycles. In Kampala, where I spent almost nine years before moving to the United States, many people are interested in owning a vehicle even when they don't own a house or have anywhere to park it. It is a problem of mindset because they think that it is a symbol of being rich. I have a fear that soon the number of vehicles will be larger than the number of people! This causes issues of air pollution now, and will make the situation worse in the future. Life in the city is not as good as it looks due to the large number of the population, vehicles, and factories. It is important that the problem of climate change and environmental challenges are given due importance and the authorities do something to prevent these consequences in the future.

Gender: My art piece has three faces on it. The first person is in the mortar and you can see legs. The second one is in the blue color and the third one is in orange yellow and red, look at the left side of the art pieces. The one in mortar is related to traditional transitioning and African myth, when we were young people in the community use to make a bad joke that if you spend one night in mortar your sex will change. The following day, if you are a girl you would become a boy and if you are a boy you would become a girl. This is a serious problem that I think every transgender person has experienced in their childhood and many are still struggling with in their adulthood, especially in Africa. Some take it as a joke, while others try it, only to find that nothing happened! Others are still struggling to access surgeries and medication, but this is hard and sometimes impossible, especially in many countries in Africa. In Uganda there is a lot of homophobia and transphobia, with transgender people in particular targeted. So, people think that if they are whom they want to be and to &quot;pass&quot;, they can reduce the many risks they face and find joy in being who they want to be.

The problems of transphobia and homophobia are similar to the problem of climate change. Both are important issues which cause a lot of harm, we need to allow people to live in peace, protect the environment, and allow the world to become a more beautiful place.","Artwork","2021","The artist is now on our advisory board, and this piece draws attention to the experiences of sexual and gender minorities living with climate change in Uganda, as well as those living with disabilities and as refugees.

Co-authored by CSIC and Laing O'Rourke Centre for Construction Engineering and Technology Research Associate, Dr Didem G&uuml;rd&uuml;r Broo, 'Four Futures, One Choice - Options for the Digital Built Britain of 2040' presents possible futures for the built environment to provide insight into how we can take swift and decisive actions to support a flourishing future and reduce our negative impact on the global environment.

'Four Futures One Choice' brings focus to opportunities presented as we plan recovery from COVID-19, the role of data to support and enhance sustainability and equality, and the potential of the UN Sustainable Development Goals to shape the built environment world of the future. Highlighting four possible scenarios for 2040: A legacy of hope; Generation zero; Resigned to our fate; and Too little, too late; the book considers Britain's economy, society and environment to explore the influencing factors and trends involved in each scenario, and the complexities of the interconnecting systems that shape these dimensions.

"NERC","NE/M000346/1","Research Grant","Artistic and Creative Products","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Bromiley","Geoffrey","","Work with artist Matthew C. Wilson","Along the lines of the theme of the consortium, Matthew and I formulated a project based on the concept of habitable other Earth's. We conducted experiments to simulate to the interior of an Earth-twin exoplanet saturated in carbonic acid. The starting mix was based on a model for the composition of the 'rocky' part of the Earth, known as 'pyrolite'. Pyrolite is a useful model for the composition of the Earth at depths of hundreds of kilometres. As such, this composition allows us to explore, through high pressure and high temperature experiments, the interior of an Earth-like exoplanet. In contrast to the Earth, however, we modified this pyrolite model so that it was saturated in carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is formed by the reaction of H2O with CO2 (water with carbon dioxide). On the surface of the Earth, water dissolves small amounts of carbon dioxide; surface water is very weak carbonic acid. Industrially elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase water acidity, which has severe effects on marine ecosystems. We are literally acidifying the planet we live on. Our model exoplanet explores an extreme outcome of this: an Earth-like planet catastrophically altered by millennia of industrialisation, and saturated in carbonic acid.
The starting mix was prepared by combining powdered oxides, hydroxides and carbonates of various elements. Small amounts of this mix were packed into platinum capsules which were then welded shut. Experiments were performed using a piston-cylinder apparatus at pressures of 2 GPa (approximately 20,000 times atmospheric pressure, equivalent to a depth of approximately 65 km). One experiment was run at 1000 degrees C, and one at 1400 degrees C, both for 48 hours to allow reaction to occur. These temperatures were chosen to investigate 'normal' or 'stable' regions of a planet saturated in carbonic acid, and regions where heating resulted in melting and production of magma, respectively.
 
We saw some really interesting things when we observed the recovered samples using a scanning electron microscope. The lower temperature experiments contain the same combination of minerals we would expect to find at equivalent depth in the Earth, although in a more oxidised form. Pressure promotes formation of carbonic acid. However, at high pressure and temperature this acid oxidises rocks; it literally pumps extra oxygen into the minerals. In some ways this is similar to the use of carbonic acid as a restorative gas (i.e. what you told me about James Watt and his invalid son). The higher temperature experiment has a combination of 'rock' and magma (liquid rock); the conditions we used provide a snapshot of a volcanic process where heat and carbonic acid cause the planet to melt. Once again, carbonic acid has oxidised the material. The magma is quenched to glass imperfectly, so that we capture small crystals starting to form, and bubbles of carbon dioxide forming. Textures suggest that this magma had a very unusual composition; carbonic acid was fully dissolved in the melt, but was slowly released as carbon dioxide and then water as the magma crystallised. 
 
In our hypothetic exoplanet, carbon dioxide and water and forced together deep within the planet to form a highly concentrated acid. However, this acid oxidises the planet, in the same way that iron rusts on the surface of the Earth. Volcanic activity on our exoplanet returns carbonic acid to the surface as both water and carbon dioxide, also producing unusual carbonatite volcanoes, similar to Ol Doinyo Lengai in Tanzania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol_Doinyo_Lengai).","Artwork","2019","-vdrome film &quot;Geological evidences&quot;; this platform provides give high profile to short films; curators include the Tate Modern's film curator: https://www.vdrome.org/matthew-c-wilson

Based on real events, the comic depicts how people living near national parks struggle to earn a livelihood faced with crop destruction by wildlife, armed conflict and competition between different authorities, including park rangers and rebel groups. 

Research on conservation, livelihoods and public authority

The cartoon, Making Ends Meet around Virunga, is based on results from a collaborative research project where six researchers worked together to capture the perspectives and lived experiences of people living around Virunga National Park. One of the oldest national parks in Africa, Virunga has drawn worldwide media attention due to its extraordinary biodiversity and charismatic mountain gorillas, but also due to the extreme challenges it faces; over two decades of protracted violent conflict, there is the continued presence of numerous rebel groups and the looming threat of oil exploitation. Focusing on the heroic park rangers who often sacrifice their life in the struggle for biodiversity, and development projects backed by donors and philanthropists, these media stories commonly portray the park as a beacon of 'hope' for eastern DRC.

During our field research in the area, however, we found that the people living around the park tell very different stories. They told us about their daily struggles for survival, and how these struggles are compounded by living next to the park. They also told us about their often conflictual relations with the park and how they fear the rangers.

Portraying diverse realities

These stories are rarely visible in international media reporting on the park, which generally focus on the wildlife and the rangers, but not the daily realities of people living close to the park. To portray these realities, as they emerged from our research, we found it useful to use a cartoon - as a visual tool. We also believe that not acknowledging the actual lived experiences of people around the park is detrimental for nature conservation, and can hamper efforts to stop deforestation and maintain the integrity of the park.

Certainly, a single story about a family (as featured in this cartoon) cannot represent all the diverse experiences people have. Yet the story presented here is based on recurring themes and testimonies in our interviews.

The power and artistic appeal of a cartoon can help disseminate knowledge outside the academy, illustrating research findings for a larger audience. As most of the communication about Virunga National Park is tailored towards (mostly anglophone) Western audiences, we also decided to publish the cartoon in French and Swahili. As there are currently many debates happening in eastern DRC about Virunga National Park, and the conflicts that surround it, we hope this work helps to link local and international debates about the park's precious future.

'The Burnt-out end of a Rainy Day' responds to the theme of 'Climate and Gender (In)Justice in the City' by registering some of the ways in which an extreme weather event caused by climate change disproportionately affects women like Yago, and her neighbours, who rent one-bedroomed apartments in a tenement - women considered by popular imagination to be part of Kampala's 'poor, working class,' and therefore whose vulnerabilities to unfair employment practices, gendered violence, and exploitation are likely to aggravated by natural disasters that arise out of unnaturally irresponsible use of natural resources.","Creative Writing","2021","This piece will be published in a leading African journal and has led to a commissioned piece of in conversation work with the author.

Maya archaeology highlights that there is an enhanced relationship between soil management and urban life. The exhibited development schemes aim to give this relationship centre stage in contemporary urban settings to improve the long-term sustainability of cities worldwide.

Out of sight, out of mind
The benefits of healthy soils extend far beyond a ground surface to live and build on. Life on Earth relies on effectively functioning and biodiverse soils, which provide the food, feed, fibre, and fuel that sustain plants, animals, and humans. With most urban soils having been built and paved over, they are often out of sight and out mind. Today, the sustainability of city life depends on agricultural land and production outside the city. However, as populations rise and cities become larger, there is an urgent need for urban spaces to forge close-knit relationships between urban inhabitants and soil health.

In their sight, on their minds
Examples of past indigenous tropical urban design teach us about alternatives to present-day city life. The Maya in the lowlands of Mexico and Central America built vast cities for over two millennia, which looked radically different from cities today. Open and green spaces dominated the sprawling landscape and housing was associated with large shared plots of cultivated land. Paved areas were concentrated to raise buildings, frame monumental architecture, and channel water runoff from public spaces, while unpaved land remained accessible to everyone for growing and manufacturing. Therefore there was a special relationship with soil management in everyday Maya urban life.
 
In our sight, on our minds: Dust to Dust set a challenge
Teams of designers, urban planners, engineers, and environmental scientists from around the world were invited to submit proposals, inspired by Maya urbanism, to stimulate an enhanced relationship between inhabitants and the ground they live on. From this, six shortlisted teams took part in an intensive research and design workshop at The Prince's Foundation in London. This exhibition presents a number of progressive visions to place healthy and productive soils at the core of sustainable urban life.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2018","Media exposure

Having been inspired by woodpecker spotting in the last three places she called home i.e. Gangneung, her first marital home; Cambridge, her current UK home; and Seoul, her latest marital home in Korea, the woodpecker symbolises a thriving lifestyle that benefits neighbours with wit and style. In this tiny book she introduces her daily stride towards sustainable life beyond her bread and butter, sustainability research. The 24 hilarious, touching or outrageous stories include; refusing single-use plastics, going flexiterian, planting a tree at a secret location near IfM, second-hand clothes hunting and having a child in the 21st Century and beyond. Although the Korean text would be inexplicable for most of the IfMers, it didn't stop many of them appearing in the book. The dark night quest for hedgehogs to Steve's garden with Steve and Ian, the lunchtime hyenas after the leftover sandwiches in the common room, the communal recycling shelf at Martin and Paulo's rented house, the teatime birding club with Aloisius, to Florian's secondhand sewing machine and the Kimchi making session with Paulo and Kirsten are only to name a few!

The weather is a dynamic system of pressure, temperature and humidity. It manifests through maps, media, and simulations while it touches the skin. Weather is felt unevenly, from extremes to mundane mildness of a breeze. Some are exposed, some are sheltered; weather wears some down, some gain profit.

&quot;Weather Engines&quot; is an art exhibition and a program of talks, performances and workshops taking place at ONASSIS STEGI and the National Observatory of ATHENS (Thissio). It explores weather as a complex system, as observation and control, and as a lived experience. The projects and events refer to natural phenomena and climate change, past and contemporary strategies of engineering the weather, as well as to different sociopolitical atmospheres related to breathing and living. Approaching the models and systems of art as techniques of knowledge, &quot;Weather Engines&quot; addresses the need for climate justice, and for embracing the surrounding more-than-human world(s).

The exhibition is accompanied by the publication &quot;Words of Weather: A glossary&quot; that maps terms for a political ecology of experience.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2022","to be determined","https://www.onassis.org/whats-on/weather-engines","622334d93b8864.72527247","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=622334d93b8864.72527247&grantRef=AH%2FS00369X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/S00369X/1","1F38EB5F-F0EF-4561-9B8D-8BAA8C97ACF8","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","A037C26F-2172-4927-91DA-921F67B7EF39","737EB87F-9A33-4FDA-B78D-03635EECB444"

Our animation builds on this tradition but takes a starker approach by visualising the data that shows how the build-up of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses has radically altered the Earth's atmosphere. The work maps from the industrial revolution to the present day the regions contributing most to the climate crisis, which can be traced through the stalagmite growths animating out from the different countries. 

Beginning with the UK in the 1750s, emissions from coal start enveloping the planet, other regions soon follow. By the late 1800s through to the current period, growing industrial and extraction activity in the Global North is responsible for 92% of CO2 with 8% coming from the Global South. The spread of CO2 described in the animation mirrors the wider historic processes of power distribution visited on poorer countries and shows that the atmosphere is as contested a space as the territories beneath it.

Paramo is the fastest evolving and colder biodiversity hotspot in South America.

The Earthrise photograph (1968) taken from lunar orbit by astronaut William Anders is an iconic image, that contributed to a rise in environmental consciousness that is still powerful today. 

Our animation builds on this tradition but takes a starker approach by visualising the data that shows how the build-up of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses has radically altered the Earth's atmosphere. The work maps from the industrial revolution to the present day the regions contributing most to the climate crisis, which can be traced through the stalagmite growths animating out from the different countries. 

Beginning with the UK in the 1750s, emissions from coal start enveloping the planet, other regions soon follow. By the late 1800s through to the current period, growing industrial and extraction activity in the Global North is responsible for 92% of CO2 with 8% coming from the Global South. The spread of CO2 described in the animation mirrors the wider historic processes of power distribution visited on poorer countries and shows that the atmosphere is as contested a space as the territories beneath it. Our animation informs the need for equitable solutions to the climate crisis that are mindful of the historic consequences of carbon exploitation to ask: Who Owns the Air?","Artwork","2021","to be determined","https://vimeo.com/645456132","6223376eed0f30.88299006","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6223376eed0f30.88299006&grantRef=AH%2FS00369X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/S00369X/1","1F38EB5F-F0EF-4561-9B8D-8BAA8C97ACF8","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","A037C26F-2172-4927-91DA-921F67B7EF39","737EB87F-9A33-4FDA-B78D-03635EECB444"

Swansea University teamed up with the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery to discover more about a portrait of a lady in the gallery collection. The team analysed and observed small samples recovered during the restoration of the oil canvas. The artist had used a blue pigment in the portrait which proved the key to finding out more. The team identified Indigo as the blue pigment used in the painting through the deployment of a series of analytical techniques. This helped them gain a better understanding of when the portrait was painted. This is due to the fact that it's known when Indigo blue was used throughout art history. Following on, scientists were able to work with conservators to uncover the identity of the mystery artist.

Visitors can participate in the interactive exhibit, view the portrait, examine cross-sections of paint samples with an optical microscope, and explore the forensic fine arts investigation.

This exhibition is a partnership with Swansea Council's Glynn Vivian Art Gallery and Swansea University.

As global change accelerates, there has never been a more important strategy for the organisation. However, strategy documents are dry, difficult to understand and ultimately, for an organisation with 19 million volunteers, hard to disseminate.

Open Lab used immersive 360 projected environments and game design to create an experience where people could live and internalise the strategy, not just read it. This is how we designed and delivered the world's first digitally immersive escape game for humanitarian strategy.

Based around the five major challenges facing the IFRC over the next ten years from migration to climate change - delegates were shown an imagined future where the strategy hasn't been implemented, they were then asked to solve a series of puzzles and 're-write history' before it was too late. The escape experience took around 30 minutes, and we designed the room to use five digital projectors to achieve full 360 projection, as well as a suite of stage lights to set ambience and immersion.

Over 300 delegates from 60 National Societies took on the escape room from youth volunteers to senior representatives.","Artefact (including digital)","2019","The immersive escape room - Escape to the Future - was nominated in the DigiLeaders 100 list for Cross-Sector Digital Collaboration of the Year and the Games for Change award in the Best XR for Change category.","https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/research/ifrc-escape-room-disseminating-strategy-in-a-new-way/","62306b6b4bdb24.58423022","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=62306b6b4bdb24.58423022&grantRef=EP%2FM023001%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M023001/1","E7A58D37-F67E-452D-A68F-55579A67CBB4","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68","1B7CBB87-6E6D-4B35-88B3-21428B800C89"

This is a great time to find common ground with concerns over biomass, and address how we use research and policies to solve the issues. We also look into to future to see how bioenergy could be adopted and become a normal way of life for all of us.

We have produced something that can reach to a wide audience, that is both captivating and highly informative. Graphic novels are basically extended infographics, using 'pictures to say 1000 words' and using text to make sure the reader understands what we are showing them.","Artwork","2017","Our industrial stakeholders and Advisory Board identified public perception as one of the key barriers to the uptake of bioenergy. By producing a graphic novel, we are providing an avenue for the public to engage with bioenergy in an accessible format.

We are launching on the 21st of March at The University of Manchester. We have various public engagement activities planned for later in the year.",,"58c292abc79a10.13223989","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=58c292abc79a10.13223989&grantRef=EP%2FJ017302%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/J017302/1","912604C8-1F27-41B5-95DA-AC5DA427A2AA","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","D381E6B5-5ECC-406A-9190-9F045CAA506B"

The lack of a waste collection system has led to several health problems in the community. To analyse the problem and identify the causes (e.g. the local government lacks financial resources) and consequences (e.g. people are forced to burn their trash in the garden, people get sick) of the problem, they used a conflict tree. Based on their findings, they organised a presentation meeting to engage with the local government, community leaders, women's council, and health organisations, among others. After the meeting, the young researchers used the information obtained to develop a draft policy brief that is divided into the following sections: general information about the project and the authors, an overview of the situation in the community, and the risks/ consequences of continuous trash burnings. The policy brief concludes with recommendations to local authorities, community leaders, women's council, health organisations, religious leaders, and educational institutions.","Creative Writing","2021","FTI is monitoring the situation.

in a marginal environment has got off to a great start. The Sundarbans, the world's largest contiguous
mangrove forest, bordering the Bay of Bengal is situated in the Ganges delta and is an environment
subject to frequent cyclones and rising sea levels. |Most recently, a cyclone of dramatic proportions,
Amphan affected the region in May 2020. The home of the saltwater tiger, the region has 54 islands
with an enormous biodiversity that were gradually intensively settled in the nineteenth century under
the British. For the island-hopping communities, mainly lower caste, tribal and Muslim living here, the
struggle for existence not only in terms of recovery and resilience in the face of natural disasters, but
also their daily difficulties have had an effect particularly on children and youth magnifying their
anxieties about their future. This unique School Project documents the voices of school children of this
region with the objective of understanding and learning from their 'uncertain' worlds. The project has
collected uncrafted narratives-oral, visual, photographic and written from 50 school children aged
between 12-15 years in an initial pilot project from the Raidighi Shriphaltala Chandra Kanta High
School in the Diamond Harbour subdivision of South 24 Parganas","Artwork","2021","As Webb and Kirby note, 'What is striking to us is how through their art and written narratives the
young people (we think it's important to refer to them as 'artists' to accord them the dignity and respect
that their work warrants) have captured both their deeply embodied and emotional experiences of
uncertainty, but equally a nuanced engagement with the complexity of how such uncertainty is lived
with:
• Bodies weighed down by being uprooted, and the familial bonds (Bappaditya Mondal; Molli
Naiya) and welfare services (Molli Naiya) that make such transitions possible.
• Nature that is at once menacing (the face in the clouds in Bappaditya Mondal's image captures
this) and offers hope through mother nature (Nafisa Molla; Koyel Das).
• Foregrounding of a relational animal/human connection in which humans have destroyed
animal habitats and still the future of both are bound up together (Nafisa Molla; Deb Kumar
Singh)'.
These are images result in what Webb and Kirby have called 'uncertain' pedagogies1
that invite
audiences (whoever they might be e.g. policy makers, scientists, planners) to respond in two
overarching ways to the images/text, that demand them to situate themselves in relation to the art and
the artists, and what is being conveyed.
1. What is this to me? What does it mean to me? How do I read this beyond climate change as a
scientific fact? What am I learning from this 'artist' that I didn't know before, and that it
wouldn't be possible to know if not presented visually?
2. What am I to this? Where am I in this story? What does this demand of me as human being?
Consumer? Professional? Citizen?
These images will be part of a wider exhibition that we plan as a joint event in the Sundarbans, in
Kolkata and Sussex","https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=mangrove-school-project-press-release-short-(vinita-damodaran).pdf&site=253","62309ab0296786.90427444","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=62309ab0296786.90427444&grantRef=AH%2FP005217%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P005217/1","F3046873-0D1E-40F3-88C1-D120D42E8978","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","A8967420-49D3-4509-9912-25FB3EC75B74","341A14E1-659D-49AE-9D88-F96FFF873D5A"

One of the outputs of this initiative was a film by Adam Chodzko about psychology and climate change called 'Deep Above'. It premiered at the Watershed, Bristol, November 2015 alongside a series of debates and workshops.","Artwork","2015","The film has been taken on tour around the UK with screenings accompanied by debates with panels of artists, academics and scientists.
These debates have focused on questions such as &quot;The role of art and artists in considering climate change?&quot; and &quot;Can psychology help us to accept and act on the scientific evidence on climate change? The impact is impossible to quantify but it has helped raise debate about scientific evidence among new audiences.","http://invisibledust.com/project/adam-chodzko-deep-above/","56e03b48a5ab74.03512875","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=56e03b48a5ab74.03512875&grantRef=G0501810","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=G0501810","15BBF9CA-768E-4195-A627-E2D3B99789F0","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","055EA8B7-2C66-4FF5-96DD-63FA3AA7D0B7","7332E1E7-D96C-4788-8F56-F515C4CD3A59"

This exhibition uses the materials held by the University of Nottingham's Manuscripts and Special Collections to explore the history of extreme weather events in Nottinghamshire and the surrounding areas. Key events in Nottinghamshire's weather history will be featured: floods, droughts, storms, extremes of temperature and other strange atmospheric happenings (some well-known, others long-forgotten). Archival sources reveal how extreme weather affected daily life in the city of Nottingham and the wider county, the impact it had on different groups in society, their responses to it and which events entered the public memory. At the time of writing the exhbition has ben visited by in excess of 4500 people since opening on 16th December 2016. 

The display also explores the contributions of Nottinghamshire people to the extreme weather archive and to the wider development of the science of meteorology. The exhibition materials not only illustrate the diversity of documentary records available for extreme weather history in the UK, but also serve to demonstrate the changing nature of weather recording and weather records over time.

Visitors have been be invited to share their own weather memories.

There are three public talks linked to the exhibition which Georgina and Lucy have coordinated
There is also a play, entitled The Storm Officer, written by Matt Black and commissioned by Georgina and Lucy as part of the exhibition activities.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2016","Public engagement with local weather histories and sharing of weather memories.

Design History and Practice: New Perspectives from University of Brighton

This exhibition showcases indicative interdisciplinary projects that explore ideas of sustainability through historical, curatorial and visual communication methods of enquiry at the College of Arts and Humanities, University of Brighton in UK. The selected projects address notions of sustainable futures in Design History and practice through 'methods and contents of convergence'. These include historical research on modern living, past, present and future, knowledge curating, future cities and meta-spaces.
The exhibition includes four research projects.

Modernity and Sustainability in Korean Kitchen Design (Dr. Yunah Lee)
Modern and Sustainable Living: domestic Interior Design in India (Dr. Megha Rajguru)
Exploring British Design: connecting archive content (Professor Catherine Moriarty)
3x4: Exploring metaspace platforms for inclusive future cities (Professor Paul Sermon)

Yunah Lee and Megha Rajguru explore ideas of sustainable futures of the development of living spaces through historical research into the development of modern domestic interior design and modular living in Korea and India. This research is supported by 'Rising Star Scheme' at the University of Brighton.

Catherine Moriarty introduces 'Exploring British Design', a prototype web interface that reveals the connections between designers and their footprint across a range of archives, a collaboration between the University of Brighton, Jisc, and funded by the AHRC.

Paul Sermon presents 3x4, an immersive, telematic environment merging two identical 3x4 metre room installations in London and Delhi to provide a playful, sensorial exploration of new hybrids of digital space. This project is developed in collaboration between the University of Brighton and University College London, supported by the AHRC. http://www.3x4m.org

Swati Janu, mHS City Lab, New Delhi","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2015","One of the impacts of featuring 3&times;4 at Gwangju Design Biennale 2015 in Korea was the extension of the dialogue around informality, living spaces and metaspace platforms to new global contexts. Screening the 3&times;4 documentary video, allowed a lens for audiences at the biennale to consider ideas relating to sustainable future cities through playful modes of immersive, visual communication. It also enabled them to critically consider existing social media platforms and acquire new knowledge of possible future city metaspaces. The documentary video of interactions within this telematic installation extended the original impact of 3&times;4 at UnBox Festival (2014). These first time encounters and experiences can be used by public audiences to influence future projects, define methods for using this new knowledge to inform themselves, who in turn tell their family, friends and colleagues of this new experience, motivating others to engage in similar experiences in future projects. The intention of this legacy is to inform a critical public community that impact on future network protocols appropriate to the needs and requirements of a future cities metaspace. At the same time it seeks to identify its relevance in the global north. The dialogue between Gwangju, Delhi and London is a critical pathway in connecting communities and contributing to dialogue on informality in the global south and its symbiotic relation to future cities in the global north.","http://www.gdb.or.kr/index.php/site/eng","56a62004dd88b8.64220440","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=56a62004dd88b8.64220440&grantRef=AH%2FM00564X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/M00564X/1","4B69C471-522C-44A0-85EF-8B45509275AF","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","5904176C-7486-4E2B-959A-94C29ADE4D96","BB7E7B1E-8865-4D13-A7B9-9A312079207D"

One promising direction that has received a great deal of recent attention is the neutral theory of biodiversity. Neutral theory provides a suite of mechanistic models that encompass speciation over evolutionary timescales as well as ecological processes such as dispersal limitation. These models make a wide variety of predictions; however in practice most studies have been restricted to species abundance distributions and other purely ecological patterns. We will investigate the evolutionary predictions of neutral theory that have either gone unexplored, or appear to contradict neutral theory. These include the lifetimes of species, the shapes of phylogenies and the distributions of endemic species on different islands. We show that whilst the best-known neutral model does not produce empirically realistic predictions of these evolutionary patterns, more advanced neutral models often can. Perhaps the most useful insights emerging from neutral models will be an understanding of when they fail to match empirical observations of ecology and evolution, and the details of which additional factors need to be incorporated to resolve the problems. We conclude that the neutral theory of biodiversity does indeed take a significant step towards integrating ecology into macroevolutionary research.","Film/Video/Animation","2011","This video has been watched over 300 times.","http://vimeo.com/21981986","r-8748675099.3399669c9bacd0","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=r-8748675099.3399669c9bacd0&grantRef=NE%2FI021179%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/I021179/1","E07F54A0-5A0E-4FF6-BF53-E2FB0D8651AF","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","01580066-69BF-4DDA-9AC1-EF7E4719585C"

One of the commissioned dialogues of the Performing Idea strand, saw JOe Kelleher engage in a roving research process around multiple scenes of European experimental theatre and Performance. The author writes: &quot;The dialogue begins with the appearance of the work. A 39 year-old theatre festival, for example, in a town without a theatre; a festival that breaks with four decades of tradition in order to re-examine and renew that tradition; that addresses the urban texture not as a void that needs filling but a space of generation; that imagines a spectator in motion, whose trajectory is governed, as curator Chiara Guidi writes, by a sensation of lost powers, and by tiredness perhaps, but who may be capable of conjuring from this trajectory 'a place filled with promises.' Or else the emergence of a new practice, work still in its nascence, work being done with the young, for example a company dedicated to the non-spectacular rigours of collective dance, and to mining the minimum pause, tracing the presence of a rhythm, as director Claudia Castellucci puts it, between one beat and another. But also then the channels, the forums, the platforms of exchange through which events and practices such as these and many others are debated over and contested and sustained, by a self-reflexive critical writing, and also by a commitment, as the editors of the journal Art'O: culture and politics of the scenic arts put it, to the idea of a future of performance even in those spaces most emptied out by current ideology.&quot;

This dialogue resulted in the Promises performance with Giulia Palladini and Silvia Bottiroli as part of the Performing Idea symposium.","Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)","2010",".","http://www.thisisperformancematters.co.uk/performing-idea/words-and-images.25.html","m-6880181829.333475a71805d0","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=m-6880181829.333475a71805d0&grantRef=AH%2FG012334%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/G012334/1","6D64D420-A96F-40F9-B182-678308B2BFB6","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","A9B1866C-EE3E-4D81-A83C-118745E9433E","867AAEA6-D1FD-4DAD-81BF-D0F4A72FF35D"

This was part of a collaboration between Open Lab and the School of Engineering at Newcastle University, the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at Manchester University, FutureEverything, and the Great North Museum: Hancock. 

The digital artwork combines artefacts from the Great North Museum: Hancock and elsewhere, with data about our environment to tell stories of how we are changing our world and our world is changing us. The artwork is designed to be experienced at a large scale, for example filling a darkened gallery wall. There is an accompanying website, including an online version of the digital artwork and further information about the objects and datasets used.

They created digital 3D models of the objects using photogrammetry and, for each object, they asked people from the museum and elsewhere to answer the questions &quot;what is this?&quot; and &quot;what does it tell us about environmental change?&quot; The digital artwork displays the 3D models, whose visability changes according to a particular set of data, whilst answers to the two questions play.","Artwork","2018","The artwork was designed to be experienced at a large scale, and was shown over three non-consecutive days in Hall 3 at the Great North Museum: Hancock during the Great Exhibition of the North.","https://hereandnowchange.net/","6230688e40df61.14305984","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6230688e40df61.14305984&grantRef=EP%2FM023001%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M023001/1","E7A58D37-F67E-452D-A68F-55579A67CBB4","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68","1B7CBB87-6E6D-4B35-88B3-21428B800C89"

One promising direction that has received a great deal of recent attention is the neutral theory of biodiversity. Neutral theory provides a suite of mechanistic models that encompass speciation over evolutionary timescales as well as ecological processes such as dispersal limitation. These models make a wide variety of predictions; however in practice most studies have been restricted to species abundance distributions and other purely ecological patterns. We will investigate the evolutionary predictions of neutral theory that have either gone unexplored, or appear to contradict neutral theory. These include the lifetimes of species, the shapes of phylogenies and the distributions of endemic species on different islands. We show that whilst the best-known neutral model does not produce empirically realistic predictions of these evolutionary patterns, more advanced neutral models often can. Perhaps the most useful insights emerging from neutral models will be an understanding of when they fail to match empirical observations of ecology and evolution, and the details of which additional factors need to be incorporated to resolve the problems. We conclude that the neutral theory of biodiversity does indeed take a significant step towards integrating ecology into macroevolutionary research.","Film/Video/Animation","2011","This video has been watched over 300 times.","http://vimeo.com/21981986","r-8748675099.3399669c9bacd0","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=r-8748675099.3399669c9bacd0&grantRef=EP%2FF043112%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/F043112/1","42D4E883-0C02-4386-BFD9-1A773BDEDB5D","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","01580066-69BF-4DDA-9AC1-EF7E4719585C"

This activity included public engagement workshops and events, engaging with a total of 147 participants including:
Monthly workshops over the period of six months that brought together scientists, academics and members of the public to explore the theme of public engagement with climate data (48 participants)
Two workshops with a woman's craft group in Loughborough (6 participants)
Two workshops with a creative writing group in Loughborough (15 participants)
Two workshops with an older mens group in Liverpool (10 participants)
A talk and exhibition at Nottingham Contemporary (25 participants)

The artwork was also presented as a performance event at Primary Studios and MayFest, Nottingham and as part of the Tropixel Open Science Festival in Ubatuba, Brazil

As a result of the exhibition and public workshops, an impact survey of users' and participants' responses has been submitted to DIS (pending review) and Leonardo Journal this Spring. This research was also accepted at a workshop for CHI 2015 and a paper was also published through Alt.CHI 2015.

The artwork was also presented at a symposium event exploring the intersection between climate science and art that took place at Loughborough University in October 2014. This event supported a discussion on how scientists and the public can co-engage with climate science and was attended by scientists, government advisors on climate change policy, interdisciplinary researchers and members of the public.

Colour and pattern are key drivers for desirability driving sales by consumers, yet there is a lack of industry innovation for future sustainable coloration processes. Rather than aiming to replicate the availability, the technical performance and aesthetic appearance of synthetic dyes, this cross discipline project led by Professor Richard Blackburn from the University of Leeds and Dr Dawn Ellams from the Royal college of art collaborated with fashion brand Rose Danford-Phillips to explore the chemistry of natural sources of pigments to be used within a holistic life cycle approach to investigate the new properties and aesthetic exploitation opportunities of a future sustainable printing system. 

Researchers from the Royal College of art explored the practical application and creative possibilities of the developed natural pigments on cellulosic and protein fibres, trialling through screen printing techniques. A series of samples using the developed aesthetic, supply and production processes was created demonstrated the colour pallet, effects of over laying colours.","Artefact (including digital)","2021","The creative print trial and practice-based element of this cross discipline collaboration identified limitations in the colours achievable, impurities present in the pigments and the interesting effects and reactions between PH of pigment and substrate.

Questions around the technical performance and possibilities to expand on the colour pallet were raised that could lead to further discipline inquiry.

 The samples produced directly informed the ideation of a fashion collection by Rose Danford-Phillips that would use the developed pigments for manufacture if created at commercial scale.","https://futurefashionfactory.org/funded-projects/rose-danford-phillips/","6213c30da3d603.40552151","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6213c30da3d603.40552151&grantRef=AH%2FS002812%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/S002812/1","A428CAF5-32D7-4100-98E2-59A5854FDD5E","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","2A3ECE8B-FCFA-4053-90EA-5CDBC3339C95"

In this project, we are using advanced recording technologies and social surveys to develop a sustainable re-construction method for seismic-prone heritage settlements of Gujarat. Capturing the built environment using 3D-laser-scanning-also known as LiDAR-gives an accurate, fast and comprehensive digital data set, measurable and coloured 3D point-cloud with a precision of millimetres, which has been combined with inhabitant's interviews. This enhanced digital model of the case study, the village of Bela, offers a basis for damage assessments, improving the chances of a rapid and effective response in case of an earthquake, as well as offering a technical platform for risk mitigation measures and community engagement, aiming to increase resilience. The methodology is scalable and applicable to other identified heritage settlements in Gujarat, India.

bumblebee nor that two species of the 28 in the UK have already
become extinct. This project had two aims a) to explore, with a positive
approach, the fragility of these amazing creatures and b) demonstrate
the variety that exists among the 26 species of bumblebee currently in
the UK.
Dr Tyra Oseng-Rees and Carly Wilshere made different bumblebees using a combination
of fused recycled glass and enameled wiring. Bottle glass was
collected cleaned and crushed, then mixed with colouring,
moulded and fired in a kiln. The wings, legs and antenna were made
of enameled steel wiring.
The handmade bees shown in the exhibition illustrated the variations of the
bumblebees through sizes, colour of the banding, shapes of the antenna
to distinguish between males and females, pollen baskets for queens
and workers for the social bee species and darker colours of the wings
for cuckoo bees, and are made of fragile, recycled glass.","Artefact (including digital)","2017","This artwork was one of sixteen developed for the Cross-pollination exhibition which to date has been held at the National Botanic Garden of Wales (throughout all parts of the Garden) and at Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, Pembrokeshire, where it currently is still on show. Plans are in place to exhibit as part of the Bath and Bristol Festival of Nature, June 2018, and Cornell University, USA in 2020. In 2017 the number of visitors to the exhibitions totaled 29,804. There were 8 days of workshop sessions with schools, families and young people with learning difficulties, a total of 414 participants. Other activities around the exhibition included 5 art crits where the work and exhibition was discussed between participants (scientists, economist, and artists) including a linguist who was researching art/science communication through this project. Notable impacts include A) One of the main aims of the project was to demonstrate to scientists that art research can contribute to scientific research and that collaboration with artists would be a valid practice. There has been a complete seed change, from what was initial scepticism from many of the scientists, to complete involvement and appreciation of the benefits of such collaboration. In impact terms this could be measured by the inclusion of artists in new projects and future proposals for funding. Of the six science teams involved in the project, two teams have applied for and received funding which now included artist/ art researcher participation and the remaining teams have planned collaborations with artists, some who were participants in the project. In addition the organisations involved i.e. The Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Buglife, Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, the Heart of Wales Line. Arriva Trains, and the National Botanic Garden of Wales are all continuing to collaborate with the project after funding. B) The exhibitions, conference and public/schools workshops have informed the public about the pollinator crisis and material evidence has been collated to demonstrate that there have been behavioural changes as a response to greater knowledge of pollinators and the problems facing them.","https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com","5aa1752d6c4169.19585658","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5aa1752d6c4169.19585658&grantRef=AH%2FN00597X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/N00597X/1","AF5C5F5A-F5F0-411B-878D-6360246B1BE2","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","7D8346F1-4332-4E10-A513-F2A5B463A923","059EC835-FD25-406D-A849-5BD0D33B0DE7"

That moment led to some serious decisions about her lifestyle and an ongoing fascination with exploring the sustainability (or un-sustainability) of the musical life. 
Her new EP, Wrack Lines, is an extension of those thoughts into a research project for which Jo enlisted the help of leading Scottish singer-songwriters Rachel Sermanni, RM Hubbert, Louis Abbott (Admiral Fallow) and The Pictish Trail. The songs they have written together explore a gamut of emotions related to travel, the environment and music. 
The title &quot;Wrack Lines&quot; refers to the name given to the waving line of detritus that is left on the beach once the tide goes out. It calls to mind images of travelling across the ocean, but also the unmistakable residue of waste that is left behind us when we do. It is also an image of the creation of music (which itself is made from waves). 
There are songs that are an expression of the need to keep moving and to keep finding new audiences to gain the kind of catharsis that makes life worth living. Others explore the off-kilter rhythms of living on the road. There is the tension between the material and the ephemeral: loneliness and exhaustion of constant travelling versus the uplifting glories of the nature of musical performance; the concrete and objective nature of the resources that we use up in order to reach audiences versus the un-measurable and immaterial aspects of the music that is given back in return. 
Each songwriter was tracked across the life of the project as they travelled across the 2015 festival season. Maps of their movement were used as the basis for the artwork (created by illustrator and designer Helen Kellock).","Composition/Score","2016","This collaborative work saw Co-I Jo Collinson-Scott (aka Jo Mango) working with professional touring musicians to and encouraging them to engage with the environmental impacts of music touring through songwriting.","https://olivegrove.bandcamp.com/album/wrack-lines-2","56dfd7ba07a1a0.26604228","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=56dfd7ba07a1a0.26604228&grantRef=AH%2FM009270%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/M009270/1","0C0F9236-A8A0-4515-820A-DDD8167299D5","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","F754BF41-54B6-4CA1-AD3E-9B1A73194688"

The wind and light over the mountains create impressions of kurak, a Kyrgyz traditional patchwork. Kura in the Kyrgyz language means to patch, or to combine separate pieces together, creating a single canvas. The stories of craftspeople and musicians in the Cultural Heritage and Humanities Unit's recent film directed by Aibek Bayimbetov (researcher at UCA) are also pieces of patchwork creating a bigger picture of the trials, tribulations, and hopes of people living along the ancient Silk Road. Over the course of centuries, the Silk Road has connected Asia and Europe through an intricate network of paths. The current interest in renewed trade between Central and Southeast Asia has created opportunities for further infrastructural developments. The film shows the faces of representatives of mountain communities in the Alai region of Kyrgyzstan and Gilgit-Baltistan of Pakistan: craftspeople at work talking about their trade and handicraft skills inherited from their ancestors. A woman from Alai talks about how the harsh climate and elevation do not allow her to grow agricultural products, so the small village relies on profits from mountain tourism and handcrafts. A farmer expresses concerns about the proximity of huge industrial mining projects near his village: the extraction brings dust and deteriorates mountain pastures in Kok-Suu. On a different part of the road, a local researcher talks about how the ethnic Kyrgyz and Wakhi people have been sharing the same space for centuries in the Pamir mountains. Later in the movie, Cholpon Alamanova, a professional artist and Kyrgyz kurak maker, travels to Gilgit Baltistan to share her art with local craftswomen. Language and cultural differences seem to disappear when craftspeople share their work. The camera intimately captures closeups of women exchanging glances and laughter while engaging in their craft. According to the creators of the film, this project discovered a common thread among mountain communities in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Pakistan because of their similar mountain geography and culture. At the end of the film, the director asks the participants: what does it mean to be happy? Karim-Ulo-Khan, a local researcher from the Sost village in Gilgit Baltistan, gives a simple recipe: &quot;Happiness lies in good words, good deeds, and good wishes&quot;. The Road of Hope and Heritage is an ethnographic documentary produced with the support of the Resilient Silk Road Heritage Network Project funded by the UK's Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF). The GCRF project links local organizations and academic institutions in Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to help develop resilient local economies and sustainable mountain societies. The GCRF Network also aims to develop a stronger South-South collaboration and knowledge-sharing platform for building lasting networks for communication and future development. The film will be shown during the travelling exhibition of Central Asian artists in Bishkek, Tashkent, Dushanbe, Almaty and Peshawar in February-March 2022, and already available online.

The Palace of Plastic is made in the collective mode of self-construction that is visible throughout the informal settlements of Indian cities.

This garment was patented by Frances Henriette Muller on 30th May 1896. It is for 'Improvements in Ladies' Garments for Cycling and other Purposes'. It consists of three part ensemble: a long tailored jacket, a straight skirt with button details running down the front and a combined knickerbocker and vest garment that is worn underneath. The skirt transforms from street wear to cycle wear via the buttons on the skirt which are connected to a series of loops at the waist, thereby raising it up from the ground. The skirt, when transformed, is concealed under the tailored jacket. The skirt is fully lined with an artwork by Alice Angus that brings to life details of the patent, lives of the inventor and influences of the time that would have shaped her invention. This garment is part of a lager ensemble made to complete the Victorian cycling costume. In addition to the skirt, jacket and combined knickerbocker and vest garment, the research team made a scarf and hat decorations.","Artefact (including digital)","2014","This garment has been worn to present the project findings in various academic and more public contexts. The transformative technology built into the garment is demonstrated on the body. These garments delight audiences and stimulate conversation about the nature of invention and inventors. They draw attention to the important roles women have play in early cycling cultures as inventors, designers and engineers. They also raise questions about what we don;t know about or what has been systematically erased from our records. What other kinds of innovation do not know about because we have not see it? How do we learn to look for these kinds of socio-technical histories? This garment forms one of five in the collection.","http://bikesandbloomers.com/category/3-frances-henrietta-muller-cycling-suit/","5463b538e401a8.22585669","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5463b538e401a8.22585669&grantRef=ES%2FK008048%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/K008048/1","72BFB7C7-4CA8-4C3D-A229-3C1B7F4B9382","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","A9B1866C-EE3E-4D81-A83C-118745E9433E","110DCCA2-AF40-47EC-A66C-D2CF9010A755"

The designs were included in a proposal document that was circulated within the strategy group. One artefact was developed for implementation. An air monitoring station in the centre of Bradford was wrapped in an original infographic design to highlight the air quality measurement at that location. 4 sides of the monitoring station were wrapped in vinyl for approximately 3 months from September 2015. Bright colours and a clear message were adopted as part of the presentation technique. The site-specific nature of the design allowed the infographic to literally make visible something that cannot be seen. This was emphasised by the backdrop for the infographic which was designed to 'disappear' at certain angles through the featuring of photography taken at the actual location.","Image","2015","Since Shipley Airedale Road is one of the busiest roads in the area, thousands of motorists will have been exposed to the infographic and its meaning. An observation test during its first week showed that approximately 25% of stationary motorists turned their heads to view the infographic. Given the fact that the audience was mobile, it was difficult to capture more qualitative data about the work's impact. 
The infographic was mentioned in an article in the Telegraph and Argus paper on the 23rd December 2015, raising discussion about poor air quality in the area. 
Reaction to the work from the air quality group itself was very positive and it is hoped that further work will occur as a result.

The temple is built from the city's waste, which aggregates in the informal recycling centre in Dharavi's 13th Compound.
The Palace of Plastic is made in the collective mode of self-construction that is visible throughout the informal settlements of Indian cities. Built with and by those of the worker colonies in a choreography of waste, the temple can be seen as a celebration of the livelihoods of all those working in Mumbai's waste management chain and their handling of the city's plastic and its recycling. At the same time, challenging public perceptions of the politics of human disposability, advocating for the work of informal recyclers as essential and valued labour within wider systems of production.
The co-design and co-creation process take place at the Compound 13 Lab, working with young people to explore issues of work, waste, survival and their social and political contexts. These issues are then enacted through the role of ritual and performance as dramatic means of collectively taking action, personal expression, instilling solidarity and creating visible issues that lie beneath plain sight..","Artwork","2020","Ongoing - this project is being curated and presented throughout 2020, and has been included in the international exhibition/academic network &quot;Project Anywhere'.","http://www.projectanywhere.net/plastic-mahal-palace-of-plastic/","5e6a468d87a033.48960867","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5e6a468d87a033.48960867&grantRef=AH%2FP00637X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P00637X/1","20B866B2-A439-41B1-AA51-57BF44EC0091","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","D60C85C3-0343-430E-81C7-B04058A4B1DF","E414F3AE-62C9-4D31-99D1-4E25D778669E"

The enSHRINE project is led by artist and researcher Lady Kitt in collaboration with composer &amp; producer Sarah Li, illustrator &amp; gender equality activist Sofia Barton and socially engaged artist &amp; architect Dan Russell.
The project sets out to explore and share effective creative techniques for organisations developing policy, whilst working in consultation with a cross section of staff / audiences/ constituents. enSHRINE aims to test methodologies which can be used by organisations to develop / disrupt / queer / (re)craft, grow and change their own organisational practices, focussing on access, care and environmental responsibility.
Kitt has a social art / community / participatory arts background. Through their projects Kitt uses collaborative art making as a way of building cohesion, understandings, enthusiasms and agency within groups. Often running craft workshops where participants make objects together, whilst discussing complex challenges in their communities or lives. Over the course of several years Kitt began to find an unexpected consequence of working in this way: often groups where making changes in organizational policy and procedure based on the conversations they had whilst crafting.
This prompted Kitt to consider more deeply the potential for collaborative creativity in developing organisational structures and systems to affect positive change and contribute to social and climate justice work. In 2020 Kitt was successful in applying for research and development funding from Arts Council England (ACE) to further explore these connections. In 2021 Kitt (working in collaboration with BALTIC Center for Contemporary Art, Gateshead) was commissioned as part of SAFEDI (Social Art for Equality Diversity and Inclusion)* to continue this work.
&quot;In my experience, one of the biggest challenges for organizations developing policy is the fear of getting it &quot;wrong&quot;. I refer to this as cultures of caution. It often leads to organizations not sharing their policy work with the people it will effect until it's &quot;finished&quot;, which in turn leads to people being unaware that the organization is taking any action, feeling disengaged, or even actively let down/ ignored. The initiatives end up not being fit for purpose because those they aim to support have not been consulted or included. None of these are conducive to initiatives becoming welcomed, use-able, lively, embodied aspects of an organizations practice. Using creative methodologies, tools and approaches can support organizations/ staff /constituents build relationships from which they understand one another's needs, priorities and capacities, developing policy and procedure that supports cultural, behavioural and structure change, based on care, access, mutual understandings and respect.&quot;","Artwork","2021","Specific policy application 1: Safeguarding and saver / braver spaces policy

These can be seen - and heard - in both indoor and outdoor spaces at the museum. As an environmental artist and creative researcher with the Heritage Futures project, Lyons offers imaginative reflections on the 'in-between' quality, and some long-durational changes - ecological and visual - in the clay-mining landscape where he has spent time fossicking over the past two years. These changes are partly a result of planned restoration of former mining areas, but plant-life, water, weather, climate etc. have unpredictable and unmanageable ways of their own. Primarily using film and sound (video-sonics), Lyons explores some creative perspectives on agents of change - human and biophysical. As well as the museum, partners on the project include the China Clay History Society, the University of Exeter's Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI), degraded-lands restoration specialists Future Terrains, and the Heritage Futures project. Also taking part are a group of photography students from a local secondary school (Poltair, St Austell) and collaborating musicians.
Evening In Arkadia: Partly referencing an ancient pastoral utopian ideal and a theme in landscape painting, the creative land-based project Evening In Arkadia is currently grounded in three landscapes that are undergoing substantial transformation. For environmental artist, Lyons, the project title condenses themes of liminality, light &amp; dark, decay/decline &amp; ecological regeneration, recovery, cycles of time and deep-time. Taking the long-view.
All three landscapes are also study sites for the connected Heritage Futures research project (Transformation theme). One is a 'rewilding' area in Portugal; another is the ex-military site of Orford Ness on the Suffolk coast; the third is the clay-mining area in Cornwall. The wider context is that of a time of a shifting, fading - of certainties?, illusions?, hegemonies? - morphing into a new zeitgeist. In these limbo landscapes, how do we relate to place, to animals, to plants - in new ways? Globally, there are probings for radical realities of multi-species healing, communitas and consilience, rooted in dynamics of deep-time physical and ecological forces; and the vortex patterns of Sensitive Chaos.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2018","The launch title of this creative programme was 'Evening In Arkadia'
This was adapted to 'Limbo Landscape Lab', and the programme will continue in future years.

i)The first of these local research, involvement and exhibition phases is now complete.
Following initial site-specific research, building relationships and collaborations, a long-running public exhibition has finished (following an extension to its running time)
This phase included successful roll-out of the following:
a) Participation with Heritage Futures in landscape and community-based research into changing conditions and future directions. This included co-organising a major workshop with cross-sectoral and international stakeholder participation, including artists from the USA, Portugal and Ireland. As part of this workshop, an artist talk was held by Antony Lyons at the Wheal Martyn museum in May 2018, for an audience of 50. This served to launch the 'Limbo Landscape Lab' project.
b) Collaboration with the Bristol-based artist group Letterpress Collective in the design and production of handmade print-run of 100 artist-posters for the Limbo Landscape Lab. Artist-postcards have also been printed.
c) Collaboration with guitarist Adrian Utley (from Portishead) in the co-production of a video-sonic work ('Sky Tip Circumstance') for presentation in the Limbo Landscape Lab.
d) Building a relationship with the main industrial heritage museum in the area (Wheal Martyn Museum), initiating a long-term (6 months) artist-in-residence period, and presenting installation works (film, sound, sculpture) in two parts of this popular regional museum.
e) Working closely with a local school - Poltair School, St Austell - in particular with the GCSE Photography Class, and influencing the creating of a themed coursework project, directly concerned with the subjects of my artist-residency and researches. This involved classes at the school, assigning work in photography and film; school visit to my exhibition, and detailed preparation for a public exhibition of the students work (more below).
f) Working closely with a community group - The China Clay History Society - to co-explore their archives and perspectives on the local landscape. This involved the production of a short film based on the role and voice of one exceptional ex-miner.
g) Sound-recorded walks with invited participants. These were undertaken in the local clay-mining landscape and at the Eden Project.
h) 'Limbo Landscape' student show of work hosted at the Wheal Martyn museum. This was the first ever public show by these students, and included still-imagery as well as film/sound works. There was good exposure of this online on 'Whats On, Cornwal'l, which included coverage of my exhibition at the museum.
i) The exhibition/installation spaces at Wheal Martyn Museum were visited by c. 3000 people, (2,200 recorded by a digital counter, operating until Sept 22, whereas the exhibition was extended to Nov 4th)
j) Press releases were sent out by Exeter University and Wheal Martyn Museum, leading to good coverage.
k) Online communication and marketing via social media (mainly Twitter), websites (Museum, Heritage Futures project and Exeter University)
l) As part of AL's Arts Council funding, a linked student photography&amp;film exhibition with Year 10 students from Poltair School in Cornwall took place at Wheal Martyn in November 2018. This followed workshops at the school, and an artist-led walk with the class.
m) 'Sky Tip Circumstance' - an artist film (with musician, Adrian Utley), presented in exhibition and artist talk (Wheal Martyn, Cornwall) May-Nov 2018
n) For 'Limbo Landscape lab' exhibitions, artist-posters have been produced with The Letterpress Collective (Bristol). Artist postcards also produced.

Andrea believes it is important to foreground the work of volunteers as it is often the unpaid enthusiasts who make a huge difference in environmental works, whether for example Bumblebee counting for the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, clearing rubbish from Nature Reserves, or in this case caring for the station gardens. Works produced 20&quot; x 20&quot; photographs of volunteers and gardens, framed.","Artwork","2017","This artwork was one of sixteen developed for the Cross-pollination exhibition which to date has been held at the National Botanic Garden of Wales (throughout all parts of the Garden) and at Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, Pembrokeshire, where it currently is still on show. Plans are in place to exhibit as part of the Bath and Bristol Festival of Nature, June 2018, and Cornell University, USA in 2020. This piece is one of two to be also exhibited along the Heart of Wales Line (Arriva Trains) during the summer of 2018). In 2017 the number of visitors to the exhibitions totaled 29,804. There were 8 days of workshop sessions with schools, families and young people with learning difficulties, a total of 414 participants. Other activities around the exhibition included 5 art crits where the work and exhibition was discussed between participants (scientists, economist, and artists) including a linguist who was researching art/science communication through this project. Notable impacts include A) One of the main aims of the project was to demonstrate to scientists that art research can contribute to scientific research and that collaboration with artists would be a valid practice. There has been a complete seed change, from what was initial scepticism from many of the scientists, to complete involvement and appreciation of the benefits of such collaboration. In impact terms this could be measured by the inclusion of artists in new projects and future proposals for funding. Of the six science teams involved in the project, two teams have applied for and received funding which now included artist/ art researcher participation and the remaining teams have planned collaborations with artists, some who were participants in the project. In addition the organisations involved i.e. The Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Buglife, Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, the Heart of Wales Line. Arriva Trains, and the National Botanic Garden of Wales are all continuing to collaborate with the project after funding. B) The exhibitions, conference and public/schools workshops have informed the public about the pollinator crisis and material evidence has been collated to demonstrate that there have been behavioural changes as a response to greater knowledge of pollinators and the problems facing them. C) In particular this artwork has had further impact, The Chair of Heart of Wales Railway Development Group was invited to the Introductory Networking Event as this group was planning bee friendly gardens at each of the 27 stations on the line. At this event a suggestion was made by one of the attending artists for each station on the Heart of Wales Line ( Arriva Trains) to 'adopt' a species of bee. Following discussions of the concept an executive decision was taken to give the Heart of Wales garden project the title the Bee Line, with stations along the route being branded for different bee species, and bee gardens at each station being developed with assistance of scientists involved in the project, from the National Botanic Garden of Wales and the Bumblebee Conservation Trust. Although not passing through populous areas, this line is primarily a tourist line and the renaming and branding will enhance the public's awareness of the plight of the bee, as well as other pollinators, particularly as it is celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2018 . The collaboration from the scientists with the volunteers developing the gardens will ensure greater success with this initiative.","https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/","5aa153f69c48b7.24104577","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5aa153f69c48b7.24104577&grantRef=AH%2FN00597X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/N00597X/1","AF5C5F5A-F5F0-411B-878D-6360246B1BE2","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","7D8346F1-4332-4E10-A513-F2A5B463A923","059EC835-FD25-406D-A849-5BD0D33B0DE7"

Together the project team gathered an archive of memories from Bristol Old Vic audiences and used groundbreaking technology to conceal the memories within the fabric of the building itself, ready to be unearthed and overlaid by generations of theatre-goers to come, creating a living archaeology of theatrical history from the audience's point of view.

The outcome of the project was a working prototype for a commercially viable, user-friendly and sustainable system for indoor positioning, a transferable solution for delivering location-triggered experiences in heritage buildings.

The Energy Babble was chosen for display in the exhibition by the curator, Katherine Moline.

From the website (http://www.niea.unsw.edu.au/events/exhibition-feral-experimental; accessed 14 Nov. 2014):

&quot;Bringing together leading international practitioners and researchers Feral Experimental aims to test the limits of possibility by exploring the boundaries and intersections of experimental practice in design thinking, speculative design, participatory and co-design.

Feral Experimental sets out to explore state-of-the-art strategies for negotiating significant contemporary challenges from preparations for extreme wildfire, to energy conservation to the preservation of cultural heritage. Feral Experimental incorporates an exhibition, a symposium, workshops and a series of public lectures. The program will highlight real world applications and the impact of design methods that are currently being developed in universities and research centres.

Experimental approaches to design thinking are engaged with user experiences via cultural probes and tangible interactions that are informed by design ethnography, design anthropology, and new combinations of technology. These approaches extend data collection methods that combine sensors, cameras, and GPS tracking to measure the affect of cycling, and technologies that emulate seeing through another's eyes.&quot;","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2014","The exhibition was very well attended by a mixture of academics, practitioners and press from Design and related disciplines.

Each of the stages found in this toolkit represents a stage from the workshop 'Using Narratives for Change', developed by Esther Carmen and Melissa Bedinger in collaboration with Scottish Communities Climate Action Network (SCCAN) working to support social change. This workshop was developed using knowledge from research and action spaces to help equip practitioners and researchers with skills to improve their narrative capacity: the ability to understand and work with narratives. This involved drawing on existing knowledge, for example from the Center for Story-based Strategy.

Along the way we learnt that narratives are messy and complex but also very powerful. At the same time, limiting our imagination may mean we overlook the role of narratives to help us achieve our objectives. This led us to understand - and represent in the illustrations that follow - narratives as a patchwork robot with many moving parts, made up of different visible and less visible elements. It also highlighted that our ability to deconstruct narratives is just as important as our ability to create them.

The toolkit is based on our 'theory of change' - our understanding of how learning about narratives can increase capacity for linking narratives and action for social change. As such we have structured each stage into three parts: the assumptions that the stage rests upon, the interventions required at the stage, and the anticipated outcomes as part of this learning journey. In the appendices we have included some materials which were developed for our 1-2 day workshop design for a small group of participants (10-15 people). We include these to offer them as a starting suggestion, with which to experiment and see what works best in your own context.","Artwork","2019","The outputs of the storytelling for resilience project were exhibited alongside photographs of climate refugees, in a large exhibition about Climate Reflections at Edinburgh's Out of the Blue Drill Hall (https://www.outoftheblue.org.uk/climatereflections/).","https://www.scottishinsight.ac.uk/Programmes/OpenCall201819/StorytellingforResilience.aspx","62291081517ee6.23470512","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=62291081517ee6.23470512&grantRef=EP%2FN030419%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N030419/1","A77F4AAA-3EE5-43C6-B73A-E1B960CFFF97","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","E5A82D2C-5AD4-488A-ACFF-566345A5D6DA","7AB40B5D-C96C-47BE-A53B-17F466E9115A"

This exhibition looks at projects that are pioneering new ways of making today; not just one-off items for individuals, but establishing a 'new normal' where manufacturing is redistributed and mass means 'by the masses' not en-masse.

A New Normal is an exhibition which asks the question 'Who is making products for a world beyond mass-production?' The participants, many of whom have been incubated by Machines Room, were chosen because they are making the future happen right now: the future where people are engaged in the design and production of their own goods by participating in online customisation and digital manufacture. These are not proposals for a future of manufacturing; each exhibit is a real business and invites the visitor to actively participate in the manufacturing process, such as laser cutting their own jacket, or parametrically designing a table for their home.

A New Normal guides you through this new normal way of life, a portrait of how it is to interact with these products and processes as part of an everyday, lived experience. It speaks from the perspective of the user, bringing the people into these new ways of designing and manufacturing, where mass means by the masses, not en-masse.

Kobble Furniture https://kobblefurniture.co.uk/

Animaro is a furniture design studio founded in London by Matt Gilbert in 2016. The manufacture and launch of the CNCd Crane Lamp was enabled by the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter and Machines Room's Maker in Residence programme. During LDF the final assembly of lamps will take place on a production line in the exhibition, ready to fulfil Kickstarter pledges. http://www.animarodesign.com/

Disrupt Disability are using parametric design, digital fabrication and distributed manufacture to make customised wheelchairs accessible, affordable and attractive. They have created the first ever modular wheelchair system so wheelwearers can interchange parts and optimise their wheelchair for their body, lifestyle and their environment. They are creating a platform so customers can fit and customise parametric module designs. They are establishing a network of designers and makers, to sell modules on their platform. Born out of a series of hackathons for wheelchair users, designers and makers, Disrupt Disability are making wheelchairs people want to wear. https://www.disruptdisability.org/

Kniterate is a desktop digital knitting machine that brings fashion fabrication into small workshops. It allows designers, artists, illustrators and makers to automatically create custom knitted products and share their work across its platform. Kniterate predicts a world of completely personalised garments which will be embedded in daily life. The machine aims to recover artisanship in fashion manufacturing while bringing modernity to its users. Kniterate was enabled by the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter and Machines Room's Maker in Residence programme. http://www.kniterate.com/

Post Couture is a fashion collective making garments that can be distributed digitally, adapted to different laser cutter specifications, cut locally, and assembled by hand without additional tools, offering an alternative to today's fashion system. They're introducing a new era in the production of sustainable and affordable clothing, operating on open-source principles and using 21st century technology. They are the first fashion label that truly embraces the Maker Movement and the Third Industrial Revolution. http://www.postcouture.cc/

Wonderbots is democratising 3D printing by creating an app that allows people to customise their own robots using a simple swipe action. The app plugs directly into the manufacturing platform 3D Hubs where the customer can then easily get their bot 3D printed, ready to play with at home. http://www.rossatkin.com/wp/

Batch.Works is the 3D printing lab in residence at Machines Room, run by Julien Vaissieres and Dylan Bahnan. Their aim is to manufacture things closer to the individual user - the right thing, at the right quantity, at the right price. After trying to make their own products they realised the normal way of getting things made was a little constraining. Small batch seemed to mean expensive and bespoke whilst big batch meant cheap at 10,000+. To make things in the middle of the city at a small scale, the obvious choice was digital tools. They print for and collaborate with others, making 3D printed consumer products part of people's everyday lives. With their 1mm nozzle they try to print faster; with their auto-print technique they print more easily, and with years of printing experience they print better. https://batch.works/

Live audiovisual performance that expands on the limits of theatrical projection. Projected images gradually detach from the screen and occupy the space. Shapes made of light change spatial perspectives and modify the screen's flat character, producing volume and depth. Audience, artists and space are integrated in an immersive narrative sustained by cinema's basic elements: light and sound.

Presentation commissioned by the Besides the Screen Network.","Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)","2016","This performance was part of a programme of live performances during the Besides the Screen event: Projection / Geometry / Performance at Coventry University, 20-22 July 2016.

By scheduling these performances within FarGo village's bars, offices, shops and studios, we were able to attract a public as well as an academic audience.

Set in an imaginary drought-struck and climate-change restricted London of 2050, the event brought 900 Londoners face to face with some of the science that is address this topic.","Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)","2015","PWG's contribution involved a mock public consultation exercise: &quot;given the need to cut London's water use by 50%&quot;, we asked, &quot;..which of the following combination of measures would you use&quot;? A questionnaire detailed different technical and social measures that could help reduce water usage, indicating some of their advantages and disadvantages, and also how much water each measure could 'save'. Participants needed to choose measures that together would deliver sufficient water.

The advantages of the event for PWG were that:
• It combined different 'sciences' - drawing on technical expertise to detail some of the scenarios, but relying on social science knowledge to imagine the event and to design the exercise;
• The team 'performing' likewise drew from across the spectrum of PWG contacts, incorporating both technical and social science scholars, as well as a number of our industrial partners;
• It made some contribution to raising public awareness of potential impending water shortages and management strategies that could be implemented now to anticipate and address them.","http://www.enlightenmentcafe.co.uk/theatre/","551176636c8b42.90737316","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=551176636c8b42.90737316&grantRef=EP%2FI029346%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I029346/1","9FC94E82-2D97-4ACC-AD6F-9417E81FC29B","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","4194AD80-4F2F-4E4A-BB92-8192A92481CE"

The exhibition arose directly from our field research in Southeast Asia, in which we wanted to understand rural health behaviour and medicine use to inform this subject. More than 15 different ethnic groups participated in our research as we travelled through 72 villages in northern Thailand. But there was much that our questionnaires and interviews could not capture. As our local survey teams shared experiences of herbalists curing broken bones and spiritual healers summoning ghosts, we wondered, &quot;What was the meaning and significance of these practices?&quot; Our research participants permitted us to share their stories, which were documented by the talented members of our survey team. &quot;Tales of Treatment&quot; narrated 16 photographic stories of traditional healing as a dying craft among ethnic minority groups in northern Thailand. Stories of herbal medicine, ghost doctors, sacred books of chants, and ceremonial posts highlight that healing maintains firm though waning links to local knowledge and belief systems even in an economy and society transitioning as rapidly as Thailand's. However, the exhibition also highlighted subtle contradictions and tensions in global health policy and research - for instance in the field of antimicrobial resistance, which is regarded a global health priority and a threat to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The stories demonstrate that seemingly modern policy tools to find herbal and non-medicinal alternatives for antibiotic treatment had been practised for centuries. This also invites reflection on critiques of the &quot;pharmaceuticalisation&quot; of traditional medicine (where herbal medicine is administered in capsules), seeing that traditional herbalists have used capsules, too, and for very pragmatic reasons. The exhibition attracted a wide range of visitors, including medical doctors, NGO staff, United Nations staff, research institutes, Thai government departments and schools, university students, researchers and other university staff, and general members of the public interested in photography and medicine. 
The exhibition was joint work between research project leader Mr Marco J Haenssgen, research officer Ms Nutcha (Ern) Charoenboon, and research interns Ms Patthanan (Mind) Thavethanutthanawin, Ms Kanokporn (Joobjang) Wibunjak, and Ms Penporn (Yok) Warapikuptanun. The event at the Warwick Arts Centre was supported by the University of Warwick's Humanities Research Fund, the Global Research Priority on Connecting Cultures, and the Department of Global Sustainable Development at the University of Warwick.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2018","The overall more than 500 visitors across our four venues engaged enthusiastically with the exhibits, the stories, and the exhibition hosts, typically spending 45-60 minutes at the exhibition. The feedback from these visitors has been overwhelmingly positive. For example, of the 23 feedback forms received during the latest exhibition at the Warwick Arts Centre, 100% of the feedback stated that the exhibition was worth visiting, and 96% &quot;learned something new&quot; at the exhibition. For the project itself, this was an opportunity to cultivate and benefit from the talent of our team, and to learn from the knowledge or our participants, enabling us to explore a perspective of healing and treatment that we could not have witnessed otherwise. The latest exhibition at the Warwick Arts Centre has also paved the way for closer collaboration with artists and visual media in future research projects.","http://warwick.ac.uk/mjhaenssgen/talesoftreatment","5c829287d23e53.29839313","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5c829287d23e53.29839313&grantRef=ES%2FP00511X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/P00511X/1","7DB901FE-08CC-43A5-A49C-35DB12420851","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","D2ACA12E-DF7C-4E4E-B8CB-27BB0B51BA50"

1. To capture the learning and good practice from the implementation of The Growth Pathway and The Transformation Toolkits
2. To disseminate them regionally, nationally and internationally to all organisations, especially Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), given we worked with SMEs for this Project

Together with Durham University's Policy Research Group, based jointly between St. Chad's College and Durham University Business School, we have written 21 case studies. 12 of the most successful case studies have, in addition, been succinctly summarised in talking head videos or 'how to' guides for transformation.

In the historical past, this has been primarily oral and written storytelling, both in poetic and prose format. But with digital technologies dominating today's culture, platforms such as youtube, tiktok and instagram have become the modus operandi for the Gen Y and Z to share what is important to them. Some scientists have promoted the use of videos for communicating science, due to their power to connect people to distant places and events that most of us have experienced. The African Research University Alliance (ARUA) Water Centre of Excellence is investigating the use of storytelling videos and digital maps for disseminating the links between freshwater related issues and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with community and government stakeholders.

This video focused on the learning from a map of South African rivers that was created by Dr Sukhmani Mantel and that went 'viral' a couple of years ago.

Rather than merely looking upon the site as a salvage mission or academic pursuit, the project aspires to appeal to local interests and provide a model for innovative and sustainable fieldwork initiatives, promoting a local sense of ownership and awareness through values-based public engagement.
The project is using film and storytelling as a strategic tool to explore various ways of (re)connecting the local community with its heritage. The aim is to build the importance of and increase appreciation for recent tangible and intangible history and use that to create a model for enhanced understanding of the past. 'The Last Layer. Reconnecting local communities with their heritage' is the first of a series of short films in which community members and the British Museum project team share their intentions, aspirations and cares.","Film/Video/Animation","2017","The production of the film coincided with the initial survey phases of the project which defines the scope of what is perceived as heritage and, as such, worthy of preservation. Shutb is an outstanding example of traditional vernacular brick architecture, increasingly at threat in Egypt as people move towards red-brick, cement and breeze-block architecture. In tandem with the architectural documentation of this heritage, the film explores how traditional historic buildings, street fabrics and public spaces are perceived, used and reimagined by the local communities.
The film serves as a forum to build trust between the community and the project. It was premiered at a public screening in the village of Shutb in October 2017. The community reacted positively and were keen to get more involved. The immediate result was a series of workshops to engage the community with the more recent heritage of the village, which resulted in footage for a second film (to be produced with follow-up funding).","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9GR_lJqQdA","5a832127ccd143.29179474","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5a832127ccd143.29179474&grantRef=AH%2FP007724%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P007724/1","C20771C1-625D-4BA4-ACF7-8434E4B29F46","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","C43CFC90-9E46-4CAA-B946-3C42D24D6DDF","2A003089-F6A5-42EA-839B-D456319FED6E"

This exhibition presents findings from Learning from Small Cities, an international research collaboration from 2018-2021 that sought to learn how small cities in India undergoing rapid and radical urban transformations, can reimagine and realise new urban futures in a digital age. Moving away from the earlier focuses on metropolitan cities in the global south, it shifts our attention towards the much neglected but dynamic context of 'small cities' that are now the frontiers of planetary scale urbanisation. 
Learning from Small Cities uses the interconnected lenses of Governing, Imagining and Living with urban futures to present how small cities have become testbeds of state imaginations of India's urban future and how the realities of living with change are complex and contested on the ground. The exhibition showcases how urban authorities translate state imaginations of smart urban futures into 'actually existing' smart cities, how ordinary citizens in these cities live with the dynamics of these changes, how they reimagine 'smart' from the ground up, and how this combined knowledge might be mobilised towards more sustainable smart urban futures.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2021","Attended physically and virtually by academics and postgraduate students.

The way we learn how cities are made and by whom has significant consequences on how urban equality is pursued.

Since 2017, the Sierra Leone Urban Research Centre (SLURC) at Njala University and the practice-based module of the MSc in Environment and Sustainable Development (ESD MSc) at the Bartlett Development Planning Unit (DPU) / University College London (UCL) have formed a learning alliance that aims to co-produce actionable knowledge to support transformative actions towards a socially and environmentally just Freetown. On the ground, our learning alliance works in collaboration with local collectives of the urban poor across the city, the Federation of the Urban and Rural Poor (FEDURP) and partnering organisations working under the &quot;Pull Slum Pan Pipul&quot; (PSPP) programme.

Every year, we are joined by a group of local interns and community facilitators whose capacity and knowledge strengthens the work of the alliance. In 2018/19, the learning alliance brought together 105 people from 35 countries, including staff from SLURC and DPU, ESD MSc students, local interns and community facilitators.","Film/Video/Animation","2019","The Knowledge in Action for Urban Equality (KNOW) project supports the educational work of SLURC, of which this co-learning alliance is one component.

PILLAR is a tribute and direct reference to the 1978 International Conference on Primary Health Care (PHC), through the Alma Ata Declaration, reaffirming health as a fundamental human right and, based on ten points, defending that PHC urgently needed to be developed and applied across the world, particularly in developing countries. In a complementary way, PILLAR also alludes to the role of the United Nations (UN) as an institution that has historically been setting goals related to the health sector, which in turn is closely related to UHC, as is the recent case of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). 3 - &quot;Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all people at all ages&quot;. Incorporating all these ideals of the PHC as a pillar to promote the UHC and reach the SDG, we also developed the visual identity and a logo for the PILLAR inspired by the shapes and colors of the SDG logo, highlighting green for being the objective linked to the health sector. We were also able to develop the entire structure of the PILLAR website, which is currently being published online.","Artefact (including digital)","2021","This Project now has a Visual Identity, logo and project website structure.",,"62338b12afd700.66354193","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=62338b12afd700.66354193&grantRef=MC_PC_MR%2FT023678%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MC_PC_MR/T023678/1","55077FC6-4AEE-4822-B081-F7B36C4D673A","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","26C780F3-C09C-449B-8608-1D62C1B60FEA","231126A9-53CE-48C4-B231-9DC411B6C87C"

As players acquire skills, they are able to complete tasks for three different social enterprises who all work towards Edinburgh's lack of pizza in three different ways.

One More Slice - who focus on producing the perfect crust and best cooked pizza.
Pizza First - who seek a sustainable future for pizza lovers and focus on sourcing the best and most ethical ingredients.
Everyone Loves Pizza - who focus on being able to produce and deliver high volumes of pizza to as many people who need it.
The social enterprises are scored on their ability to find volunteers who can complete tasks at varying levels of difficulty.

Our real motivation is to use Pizza Block as a metaphor, introducing participants to digital blockchain identity management systems by producing a number of physical artefacts which relate back to components of digital blockchain identity management systems:

A personal ledger, unique to each volunteer which shows the order in which they learnt skills and completed jobs. This could be simply seen as a volunteering CV.
A public ledger which both volunteers and social enterprises can check if there is any question over the volunteers claimed skills.
The social enterprises have a record of completed jobs with a snapshot of the skills of the volunteer who completed each job.
These physical artefacts provide starting points for conversations revolving around how blockchain IMS could be used in the future.","Artefact (including digital)","2018","TBD","http://oxchain.uk/2019/01/29/pizza-block/","5c8932289d0915.59398312","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5c8932289d0915.59398312&grantRef=EP%2FN028198%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N028198/1","3185E56D-29F0-4D43-B965-F2B9B1895C45","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","ADDE3750-CED3-4CA4-A303-BAD32A0C4A82"

The condition faced by the &quot;&quot;Mamak&quot;&quot; character is an illustration of the changing role of gender in the adaptation process to the Flood Rob environment which shows the double burden of the &quot;&quot;Mamak&quot;&quot; character.

This exhibition presents findings from Learning from Small Cities, an international research collaboration from 2018-2021 that sought to learn how small cities in India undergoing rapid and radical urban transformations, can reimagine and realise new urban futures in a digital age. Moving away from the earlier focuses on metropolitan cities in the global south, it shifts our attention towards the much neglected but dynamic context of 'small cities' that are now the frontiers of planetary scale urbanisation. 
Learning from Small Cities uses the interconnected lenses of Governing, Imagining and Living with urban futures to present how small cities have become testbeds of state imaginations of India's urban future and how the realities of living with change are complex and contested on the ground. The exhibition showcases how urban authorities translate state imaginations of smart urban futures into 'actually existing' smart cities, how ordinary citizens in these cities live with the dynamics of these changes, how they reimagine 'smart' from the ground up, and how this combined knowledge might be mobilised towards more sustainable smart urban futures.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2021","Attended physically and virtually by academics and postgraduate students.

It blows household dust, removed from the inside of a computer carcass, into the air. The continual movement of dust is contained in the piece. However, the ceaseless creation and motion of unconfined dust accompanies all stages of the e-waste journey.

Dust has pervaded this project, in many and unexpected ways. We have been covered in dust, breathed dust, and been infected by dust. Dust has been a surprising and provocative companion.

Our first encounter with 'fresh' e-waste, at the V&amp;A, was disappointing due to the absence of dust covering the freshly disposed carcasses. Also a surprise was the amount of dust we found inside the discarded computers we dismantled in Hong Kong. These machines suck in dust in startling quantities. The dust, both present and absent, in these two cases was very much the familiar dust of everyday domestic life; the stuff we find clinging to our furniture and filling our vacuum cleaners. It is the organic dust of human skin debris, pet hairs and dust mites; a fertile, rich medium.

The other types of dust we have encountered have been much more dangerous. This has reminded us that dust is not a stuff but a category. What comprises specific dusts varies with the activities and locations where we find e-waste processing. Inorganic dusts comprising heavy metals, and other toxic and indigestible fragments, poison and infect people, animals, and the land itself. Most startling was the dense layer, thick as fur, of metal and plastic dust that coats the machinery at high-tech recycling factories.

These different varieties of dust extract various kinds of revenge; familiar, organic dust clogs the machine, accelerating its journey to obsolescence, while the dangerous dust of e-waste processing retaliates against both individual bodies and the social body whose hubris set the whole process in motion. A measure of dust for a measure of dust. - Neil Maycroft","Artwork","2015","Impact and contribution to the projects Exhibition at Watermans as a culmination of findings.","http://ewasteperformance.tumblr.com/post/130130300824/exhibition-at-watermans","56e09194eaa3e4.93442268","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=56e09194eaa3e4.93442268&grantRef=AH%2FL01582X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/L01582X/1","1B21152E-F699-4438-AA12-BFB5FE21880D","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","11FECE84-7672-4809-88F2-FEB786E20A70","1A979551-B70F-4B93-9B5C-EAB80F40B310"

But who makes these stories and how can we learn to listen? 

Ears to the Ground will work with a group of young people to explore how stories entangle local and global experiences, weaving together social and ecological encounters into a tapestry of movement and audio performances inspired by the murmurings of place. 

One Step Theatre uses performance and participation to facilitate environmentally focussed creative encounters. Our performances offer a platform for young people to include their voices in the current environmental conversations within their local community. 

One Step Theatre's last project, If Not Now, explored the relationship local families in our coastal county have with the global plastic pollution crisis, touring schools, libraries and museums along the Devonshire coast. Follow us on Instagram @onesteptheatreco and Twitter @onesteptheatre 

Date: 15th August","Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)","2021","Full evaluation available upon request. 

Reflecting on all three performances, they were organic in style and presentation. Although the audio and environmental space were consistent, the audience and the actors interaction with the audience, the pace, playfulness and intensity were different. It was clear that all of the actors grew in confidence as the performances progressed. 

From discussion with the young people over the week, at the end of the final performance and from talking to their families, the project has had a strong impact in developing their confidence, their resilience, their creative and performing skills and improved their social and emotional well-being.

Being co-creators in the work, using their own ideas and being treated as adults were regularly mentioned positively by the participants. Being encouraged to participate in an activity which was outside their comfort zone by someone they trusted, a teacher, a family member or a friend, was also important. During the week trust between the group grew so they were more willing to take risks and explore performance strategies they had not encountered before. By the end of the week there was a strong sense of collaboration and understanding within the group of participants which was evident not only when speaking to them for feedback but also within the performance. This is surprising bearing in mind the age and backgrounds of the participants. Parents and family members also confirmed the young people's new found confidence in working with people they did not know, a developing resilience in completing a project and not giving up when things were not comfortable, and increased social confidence. All skills and attributes the young people can build upon in later life. 

The young people and audience members regularly spoke of seeing their environment in a new light; appreciating the ecology of a small space and examining how humans can impact on this environment.

The project provided an opportunity for the participants to voice their ideas and opinions in a creative way and for the audience of mainly adults to listen to them.","https://openairperformance.com/gallery/","6221deb8cca560.35855881","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6221deb8cca560.35855881&grantRef=AH%2FV015230%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/V015230/1","2718969F-D054-4F10-9F2F-83D87CE44886","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","EA7A55EA-489A-4183-B587-58BE97924BAE"

The intent of City Desired is to foster and enrich multiple publics that will take the city in its current forms and future trajectories as a matter of democratic concern and action.

LabSpace, Harbourside 21st and 22nd of February 2015.

On the weekend of the 21st and 22nd of February Water City Bristol and Bristol Loves Tides (A Bristol Green Capital Project) were invited by Bristol Green Capital event curator Anna Farthing to put on interactive exhibition in the Green Capital Lab Space on Bristol Harbourside. The purpose was to populated the space with a series of linked exhibits about water, energy, ecology, history, place and landscape for the weekend.

The room was also shared by the Marine Conservation Society and Bristol City Council with a range of displays about marine ecology, marine pollution, tidal energy possibilities on the Severn Estuary, as well as the focus on Bristol's tides past and present.

The room was set out with a number of interactive displays, information boards and a series of screens. Water City Bristol / Bristol Loves Tides also had a table of book exhibits and a large white model of a Severn Pilot cutter on which members of the public were invited to write comments upon. This was used as a spur to generate conversations about Bristol's tidal past,present and future, wider water issues, and ecological issues beyond that.

The event was also used as an opportunity to publicise the next Water City Bristol / Bristol Loves Tides event to be held in another part of the docks on March 22nd. It also coincided with the nearby art installation &quot;Smoke Bridge&quot;.
The Water City Bristol / Bristol Loves Tides staff on duty were Professor Owain Jones; (PI on Towards Hydrocitizenship project); Antony Lyon (NOVA) (Project Consultants on Towards Hydrocitizenship); Warwick Morton (shipwright and associate of My Future My Choice); Hugh Thomas (Director My Future My Choice).Volunteers for Bristol Green Capital Staff also took part.

Over the two days there was a steady walk through of people and it is estimated 210 people interacted with the displays and entered into conversations with the volunteers. Numerous comments where written on the 'white boat', all of which were captured as an image, and some of which were tweeted as pictures. This boat will be used in further displays and activities.
The participants ranged widely in age and other demographic categories and were variously local Bristol residents, tourists visiting Bristol, and students studying in Bristol.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2015","Increased awareness of future events for the Bristol Green Capital project Bristol Loves Tides.

The Deep focuses on the rich and coveted geologies of Scotland's Highlands and Islands to reflect on the ways in which we interact with the environment that sustains us. The project interrogates the dynamics of power and transgression, enrichment and impoverishment, that underpin conceptions of freedom and agency in our profit-driven societies. Inspired and informed by Martin Heidegger's ethics of the earth, it asks: What is the place of the human in the face of our fast depleting natural resources? How can we see the world afresh and reposition ourselves humbly before other beings, the earth and its atmosphere? What foundations remain for us to nurture and sustain? This creative enquiry re-considers questions of trace, form, light and scale by placing the photographic process into dialogue with the art practices of painting (Cy Twombly and Peter Doig) and sculpture (Eduardo Chillida and Fischli &amp; Weiss). 
The Deep is funded by Creative Scotland in partnership with Taigh Chearsabhagh Museum and Arts Center.","Film/Video/Animation","2022","This is an ongoing project. It includes an online mentoring programme for artists living and working in the Scottish

Carbon Chronicles' visualises the build-up of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses from the industrial revolution to the present. Beginning with the UK in the 1750s, emissions from coal start enveloping the planet, other regions follow. By the late 1800s, growing industrial activity in the Global North is responsible for 92% of CO2 with 8% coming from the Global South. The spread of CO2 mirrors wider processes of power distribution showing that the atmosphere is as contested a space as the territories beneath it.

Icon or an eyesore? Spoil heap or an archive? 

In July 2021, a group of young people met to walk, collect, photograph, and make art on West Lothian's oil shale bings. 

Bings are vast heaps of shale waste or blaes produced through the oil extraction process. Shale was deep mined in West Lothian then &quot;baked&quot; in huge furnaces (retorts) to extract oil. Once the black sludge oozed out, the pink crumbly waste shale was taken to a nearby dumping ground in a trolley (hutch), winched to the top, and tipped over the edge. Repeated for more than a century, the trolleys and trolleys of waste shale rose up to form this process resulted in twenty-seven bings rising up on the landscape of West Lothian, comprising some 300 million tonnes of shale waste. 

Local opinion about the value of the bings remains divided: for some they are eyesores, a depressing reminder of West Lothian's post-industrial struggles; for others they are cherished components of the local reality, viewpoints in an otherwise flat landscape, and sites of rare flora and fauna. Together with participatory artist and photographer Lisa Fleming and a group of young people from West Lothian, we set out to think about the bings creatively: What role do they play in local imaginations? To which futures do they belong? 

The group put together an exhibition at the Wee Museum of Memory at Livingston Centre that comprised archival photography, painted shale and other found objects, and cyanotypes created during the workshop. Archival photos hold special significance for local communities, as they are interwoven with the family histories of many living in West Lothian today. The cyanotypes that we hung on the walls reflected on something rarely thematised in connection with these landscapes: the idea of the post-industrial sublime. The bings' rich biodiversity - a result of the neutralising retorting process -- is featured in their work in dreamlike form. At the heart of our exhibition is a group of people who came together after being in isolation to connect with each other and with the landscape. We hope that our collective work inspires more people to visit the bings, to learn about their history and heritage, and to engage with them in new, creative ways. 

Artworks created in July 2021 were on display at the Wee Museum of Memory in Livingston Centre between September 2021 and January 2022.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2021","- one of the young people who took part in the Schools Photography Project and exhibition went on to do an internship at the Museum of the Scottish Oil Shale Industry in Livingston; she is now considering a university degree in museum studies or curatorial practice;

Defeat would have cut off the British expeditionary probably forcing the allies to surrender.

Against overwhelming odds the Worcesters who had already sustained heavy losses, bravely charged over open fields under intense fire to the heavily defended Gheluvelt Chateau where there was fierce hand-to-hand fighting. Eventually, the Germans retreated. The British line had held and the tide was turned, but 187 of the Worcesters were killed or wounded.

The film is being used within teaching packs currently under development on gender, culture, and intersectionality.","https://empowering-women.net/watch-antanrangada-maatu/","5e467344cfb959.71068625","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5e467344cfb959.71068625&grantRef=AH%2FR003491%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/R003491/1","D3BC456B-F72D-4552-8026-BAECEA16DF22","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","B4833390-EB88-4440-ABE0-E80140B75D12","4136395F-91EA-4011-9C44-FEA84607E581"

The programme explored how arts and humanities-based approaches including photography, video, participatory theatre and storytelling could be used to promote education and generate discussion and action on climate change and climate change induced food and livelihood insecurities. Programme participants included core network members from Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jordan and UK, core project artists, as well as other artists, academics, teachers, cultural practitioners and education and cultural policy makers from the UK and elsewhere. The programme included an exhibition of artefacts (photographs, films, installations and performances) from all four project locations, round-table discussions, seminars, hands-on workshops, and symposia, all of which were open to the public. Private views (for additional impact and networking opportunities) as well as a guided tour and seminar session for a school group were also organised during the four day programme. The programme attracted an audience of 2,207 people, with additional virtual involvement and participation via Skype links and Instagram.The full four day programme can be accessed on picturingclimate.net. Whilst reported on here, the programme was also an engagement activity.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2019","The programme attracted an audience of 2,207 people, including artists, teachers, academics, socially engaged practitioners and cultural practitioners. It thus provided a unique opportunity for network participants from Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Jordan to share knowledge and experience of climate change and the arts-based programmes they developed in their individual locations with each other and with a broader UK and international audience, and to learn from the experiences of UK teachers and practitioners. The programme also provided a significant networking opportunity for artists, cultural practitioners, teachers, NGO leaders and programme developers from Cuba and Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose mobility is otherwise highly restricted, to meet and learn from each other, and from their UK counterparts. The Picturing Climate project in general (and Tate Exchange programme specifically) also introduced Cuban, Bosnian and Jordanian practitioners and teachers to arts-based and participatory pedagogies and methodologies that are not normally used in local classrooms, where rote learning prevails. As reported by Cuban and Bosnian colleagues, it has generated a desire among local teachers and heads of school to incorporate more these kind of methodologies into the curriculum. It also prompted the desire to incorporate teaching on the environment and climate change into curriculums, something that is currently absent from curriculums in both Cuba and Bosnia and Herzegovina.","http://picturingclimate.net","5e4e8400bdd4c6.24902344","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5e4e8400bdd4c6.24902344&grantRef=AH%2FS004114%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/S004114/1","9E3F8AA2-75B6-459C-8540-B161D4FA2744","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","89E6D9CB-DAF8-40A2-A9EF-B330A5A7FC24","C72139F6-2C42-462E-84C4-7422DDDDA059"

The history of conservation in East Anglia is also the story of individuals who fused science and passion to leave a legacy of habitats and environments secured in nature reserves and distributed between the major conservation groups - the National Trust, the RSPB, the Cambridgeshire and Norfolk Wildlife Trusts. The fact that these separate organisation have separate histories sometimes obscure their common history that we now all benefit from, rooted in the actions of critical individuals which Voices from the Reeds will bring to life, thereby creating a field-guide to the history of ecology in the region.
The Form
In a time of social distancing this project creates an intimate portrait of 12 moments and individuals within the first century of conservation via 12 monologues performed by actors marking turning points. This endeavour would link up the four main conservation groups in the region and focus on their totemic sites - Wood Walton Fen, Wicken Fen, Strumpshaw Fen, Titchwell Marsh, Hickling Broad and Scolt Head Island.","Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)","2020","A selection of the monologues first were overlaid on footage from the East Anglian Film Archive as part of their online open day 'Hidden Nature' in September 2020 which drew on archival and rare footage of the ecology of East Anglia; this enabled the first professional outing for fledgeling UEA based drama company UEA Alumnus Theatre company.
Then in Autumn 2021 performance of the monologues was presented outside on UEA campus by student theatre company Minotaur as the highlight of their COP26 festival; this will be revived during the forthcoming symposium 'Song of the Reed: Rewilding Drama' which will be held at UEA on July 9th 2022.","https://eafa.org.uk/highlight/heritage-open-day-2020-hidden-nature/","61e6d4afb0e5f8.40914176","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=61e6d4afb0e5f8.40914176&grantRef=AH%2FT005297%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/T005297/1","50F17D21-31C4-45C2-9CE5-6000C6809E20","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","88C5F7F9-8DCC-41C9-BC4F-F37DA01075C7","ADA9C74B-91E1-485D-B6EE-1046C65CF6DF"

Forum theatre is a form of participatory theatre that has been specifically designed to discuss power relations between different characters. It is a powerful tool for breaking down barriers, and fostering co-production of adaptations options. The process explores different perspectives and experiences of characters facing climate change. Faced with common challenges, scientists, government officials, policy makers and farmers are confronted with conflicting agendas and ambitions that have an impact on decisions to adapt tomorrow's agriculture. The role-playing is followed by forums where each &lt;&gt; can change the scenes and the outcomes. 

Working with Kaddu Yaraax, AMM2050's scientist have developed a theatre forum piece exploring the different perspectives and experiences of scientists, government officials, policy makers and farmers. The piece confronts the conflicting agendas and ambitions that have an impact on decisions to adapt. It explores the vital importance of building understanding amongst partners engaged in collaborative resilience-strengthening initiatives to ensure benefits for all participants including at-risk groups, national and international researchers, government bodies, funding agencies and humanitarian and development agencies. 

Given the increased focus on collaborative approaches to resilience-building, the Theatre Forum film illustrates a practical approach for operationalising co-production across disciplines, sectors and decision-making levels.

Gobabeb's Research Manager Eug&egrave;ne Marais wrote of how much he appreciated how the exhibition shares 'stories, memories and knowledge of the people that inhabit the spaces that we so often pass through and know so little about'. Jeff Muntifering, Science Advisor to Save the Rhino Trust, wrote that the exhibition encompasses a 'very inspiring collection of stories &amp; song - so worth preserving!' Basilia Shivute of IRDNC (Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation) shared how the exhibition made her feel 'proud of our national cultural heritage' and specifically thanked Welhemina Suro Ganuses - Future Pasts Namibian research collaborator from Sesfontein - for 'being our ambassador'. 
 
Some visitors were Namibian residents or tourists to the country who heard about the exhibition through word of mouth:

Defeat would have cut off the British expeditionary probably forcing the allies to surrender.

Against overwhelming odds the Worcesters who had already sustained heavy losses, bravely charged over open fields under intense fire to the heavily defended Gheluvelt Chateau where there was fierce hand-to-hand fighting. Eventually, the Germans retreated. The British line had held and the tide was turned, but 187 of the Worcesters were killed or wounded.

With access to the unique archives of the Worcester Regiment, military historian Dr Spencer Jones, explains how this remarkable engagement took place.","Film/Video/Animation","2017","nothing reported","http://historywm.com/films/31st-october-1914-stemming-the-german-tide-battle-of-gheluvelt/","59f9e6c3ce8cb7.93326264","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=59f9e6c3ce8cb7.93326264&grantRef=AH%2FP006698%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P006698/1","C091354E-25D6-4A87-A761-1BA095ECB8BB","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","1F3E180F-D70F-446C-92C8-4AD9771A8636"

The vast majority of garment workers in Indonesia - about 99% - are women, and this portrays a stereotype that women are responsible for domestic duties. The condition gets worse when these women are abused in their workplace, harassed, threatened, and even get underpaid for long hours of work. Yet, they could not say anything. Same thing happened to our dear Mother Earth. The exploitation has been going on for so long that we start to normalize it. The excessive waste, water depletion, and pollution are all over the place.
Through this illustration and instrumental piece, I tried to portray how our 'mothers' are exploited for those things we call &quot;fashion trends&quot; that might go obsolete in no time. Ironic. In the video, I put a major chord as an opening, just to show &quot;a dress&quot;. A simple one. The repetitive tones express how this dress is adored by everyone - that type of dress that you must own in your wardrobe. And the mood suddenly changed when the illustration of what was behind that Rp 100k dress was shown. A minor- horror-like tune to represent how I feel reading about these nightmares.","Artwork","2021","This has contributed towards the development of a new creative community of practice addressing the challenges of gender injustice and climate change in Indonesia.

Their particular reflections speak to the history of forced removals and impact of extractive oil, gas and minerals along our coast line. 

Lalela weaves stories, histories and contemporary concerns of diverse South African coastal communities into an Empatheatre production, Lalela uLwandle explores themes of intergenerational environmental injustices, tangible and intangible ocean heritage, marine science and the myriad threats to ocean health. Lalela uLwandle is an invitation to a participatory public conversation on ocean governance in South Africa.

- to inform, enhance and stimulate public awareness, understanding and appreciation through accounts and representations of extreme weather events; and how responses to such historical occurrences might inform contemporary experiences, strengthening local and regional regard for adaptability and resilience;
- methodologically, to devise modes of performance appropriate for the dramaturgical assemblage of diverse materials - including scientific data - and for their public exposition in live situations;
- to develop procedures to help illuminate, explicate and problematise the multiplicity of meanings that resonate within extreme climatic experiences;
- to evoke past events and the immediate responses to them: of both trauma and resilience; bridging a linguistic as well as a historical and cultural gap between texts and modern audiences. 

To this end, we commissioned Welsh performance artist Eddie Ladd to create a summative work. Challengingly, her impulse was to draw together an extreme weather event and a contemporaneous 'extreme' political event, in a performance with three distinct elements: dance, live soundtrack and spoken text. The performance was inspired by the archival research into historic weather, and data from visualisations developed by the Met Office of extreme weather. We have documented this performance, the creative process involved in its development, including the use of associated historical sources, and this digital archive will remain on the project's website, at the National Library of Wales, as a permanent digital record of the project. 

About the performance
Eddie: Snow began to fall on Boxing Day, 1962. It kept snowing, drifting and freezing until the end of March, 1963. Despite the bitter weather, Emyr Llywelyn, Owain Williams and John Albert Jones decided to go ahead with their planned action against the site of the building of a dam in the Celyn valley in north Wales, intended to provide water for Liverpool. Late at night on February 9th, 1963, the three above broke into the site and planted an explosive device on a transformer that was a part of its power system. By the time that the thaw set in at the end of March, Emyr Llywelyn had been caught and sentenced. 

The conceptual trajectory here is fascinating. Eddie observed that there are now willows on the banks of the reservoir, and that by lore willows weep because whilst slaves in Babylon, the Jews hung their harps in them. So, she invited radical harpist Rhodri Davies to create the score. Rhodri involved sound artist Lee Patterson and together they created a sound world that involved freezing and thawing a commissioned harp - rigged with contact microphones - in a block of ice, and submerging another; and then manipulating the results.

I knew that the three who bombed the site had to contend with snow on their way there but thus far I hadn't drawn the two stories - one about the hard winter of 1963 and the other Tryweryn - together. They always counted as two stories to me - two separate legends. But 'The Snows of Yesteryear' project offered me the opportunity to consider them in the same time and space. 

To begin with, I liked the idea that the weather had no impact on the deed. I liked too that the activities should be considered as a lump of stuff in our human story. Finally I liked that it was an unusual story about unrelentingness and our survival.

It goes to the bottom - to the cultural survival of Wales and Welsh. I was almost considering the anxiety about the climate (here in Wales at least) as a 'soft' subject compared to this.

Eddie wanted to allude to snow, and initially considered salt, then fake snow. The decision to use two tons of flour had a number of implications: the potential for actual explosion being the foremost! Principally, it created a testing environment in which to perform, impacting ergonomically upon her choreography. But she could also create small detonations, and mimic frosty breathe, by exhaling variously.

This was a story about an event using explosions and the floor was made made out of explosive material. Something to allude to the land and this created far above its head. By holding it in my mouth and breathing out, I could integrate activity and thinking about the physical struggle together.

The change in her appearance was further suggestive. Eddie:
Although the brief was to make a piece on extreme weather, I also began to think about the dances that native Americans [in pale make-up] conducted during the 19th century. These were a means of recalling a culture that was rapidly being destroyed with the expansion of white culture westwards into America. Tribes would meet, sing, eat and dance to the point of hallucination, for five nights at a time. The piece sets itself in this context and asks us, perhaps, to consider the action against the site of the reservoir, as it was largely symbolic, as a kind of ghost dance in and of itself.

The final dramaturgical component came with the texts written and spoken by Dr. Roger Owen from Aberystwyth University: combining the poetic rendering of data with historical account, that drew upon a field interview with Emyr Llewelyn himself. 

Dawns Ysbrydion/Ghost Dance - a monochrome dance theatre show in three phases:
The intention: ten dances, with two texts in Welsh on how snow is formed and on the production of adrenaline; 
The act : introduction and four dances, with a text in Welsh on nitroglycerine, a component of gelignite;
The sentence: two dances, with the Welsh text describing the process of thawing.

A performance beautifully and profoundly allegorical: with multiple entwined resonances, where perhaps we had anticipated something didactic. A wintery landscape of tracks and clouds and hard going; a devastated, apocalyptic world
Eddie - dressed in white, with white contact lens - as animate snowman; Japanese butoh dancer; camouflaged activist; silent apparition; millenarian augur (orger), both culturally and climaticallyOccasioning room and cause for thought
Roger - 
In the air
Dust
Invisible tissue
Mobile through
Cold and warm currents
A magnet for vapour
 
To form a cloud
A host of particles
Assembling, flowing, mingling, tumbling
 
And ripening
To supersaturate
And now
It cannot hold
It cannot contain
The unknowing cold
Makes crystals
 
Deep in the damp
The bonds' quivering
Stills
And the molecules scrum in frozen,
hexagonal
Layer upon layer
Solid and light 
Each one minted
Identical threepenny, sixpenny twelvepenny
 
But rolling through the cloudswell
Warm surge, cold retreat
They
Stretch and flinch
 
Arms, fingers, teeth, hair
Wings, blades
Heat, cold carving character
As they descend
 
Each snowflake
Is the story
Of its own fall

Remains Scape?' and 2. 'Engal kathai' ('Our Story') have been developed based on the outcomes from the project and written in English and Tamil.

1. Reminiscence is the primary theme of digital poetry 'Lost water! Remains Scape?'. It is mediated through text, animations and images. Waterscape is an imperative source and forms a conducive ecological community in every villages of the region Coimbatore. It is a primary source for drinking, irrigation and other economic and cultural activities. However, the forgotten waterscapes due to drought, dereliction and climate change have become conduit of drainage waters, and garbage dumbing areas. The photos that have taken during our field visits depict the current condition of waterbodies among which most of them are in dreadful state. On the other hand, the oral testimonies of the local farmers illustrate a different situation of waterscapes a few decades ago. They narrated how they were blessed to have had a healthy waterscape in the past. They also told us that there were particular flora and fauna that belong to the region had been destroyed and some of the specific species such as Noyyal Otter had gone extinct. The interactive 2D and 3D environment of digital poetry provides a revisitation to such lost waterscapes created based on the oral testimonies. 

2. 'Engal kathai' ('Our Story') narrates the stories of the four historical tanks of Karur district which was part of Coimbatore region during British colonial period, Tamil Nadu, South India. Of these tanks, the 1300-acre Panjapatti tank was established during the British colonial India in 1918. However, this tank is merely a dry land for 16 years due to climate change and mismanagement in the water distribution. The next one Velliyanai is very old water tank built 1200 years ago is dry for 10 years and the mavuthur and Udayampati periyakulam are old as Velliyanai but there is no record when they were exactly built. They are also dry for a number of years. The rivulet Pungar which functioned as a major source for water to these tanks have enormously been reduced in terms of its length and width. The other multiple water paths are blocked by weeds, wastages and muds which further prevent the water flow to these tanks. The combination of climate change and mismanagement lead to the tanks merely a dry land.","Artefact (including digital)","2021","These creative productions will be shared with local project partners, local schools and colleges, social media and website.",,"6048cec96173e2.43940133","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6048cec96173e2.43940133&grantRef=AH%2FT011580%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/T011580/1","6E508FBF-CFC6-489D-8706-9B7E4006C99B","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","8285A20E-3315-4C0C-B45F-2C4196040C1B"

Films of all projects as follows
A selection of five films are below:
1) #Patchworks project participants introduce a prototype called #PAT, a Personal Appointment Ticketing service. #Pat is intended to enable homeless people living chaotic transient lives to track their appointments with the swipe of an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) enabled wristband or card. The team developed a shoebox-size device that contained a Raspberry Pi low-cost computer, RFID reader, and a tiny printer, similar to that in an electronic cash register. The #Pat device then prints out a personalized reminder list of appointment dates, times and places. As such, #Pat provides inexpensive, mobile access to information for those with limited or restricted internet access. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydPcxuixhAw
2) Access ASD, saw computer scientists, sociologists and designers, working with people with Autism to develop a prototype called 'clasp' (follow on funding has just been confirmed): 'Clasp' is a hand-held digital anxiety management tool, controlled by sensory response. On squeezing, the tool connects to a digital peer support network, that is safe and secure, to help reduce isolation and gain immediate support. The tool also provides an anxiety tracking system, including a GPS-based locator facility, enabling users to monitor and self-regulate their behaviour. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjvLZrEYE7M 
3) The Launchpad project, Local Wealth: Local Trade, has now received follow-on funding and developed into Barter. Barter is developing a mobile application for a new loyalty trading system which records transactions and tracks the trading patterns to reward sustainable and locally beneficial trading in Lancaster. It uses near field communication (NFC) enabled loyalty cards that are swiped every time a trade is made. The data thus collected can then be viewed over time to reflect on trading practices. http://barterproject.org/so-what-is-barter/

The sound recording was by the project's creative collaborator, Richard Gott. The film specifically addresses the ways in which climate change affects heritage in the low-lying island nation of Kiribati. It does this by bringing together diverse perspectives through a sequence of interview clips with the President, cultural officer, community members, activists, and scholars in Kiribati. These are layered with a visual representation of the landscape and culture. 'Troubled Waters' may begin to redefine the very concept of heritage, which is presented as inextricably connected to land and the natural environment in Kiribati.","Film/Video/Animation","2015","The film has been shown in its entirety, or as a series of clips in several public events and academic conferences, detailed separately. It is hard to prove a change in public perception (which is an overt aim of the project), but audiences have reported that they had not previously considered climate change as affecting culture (or fully acknowledged how culture frames the experience of climate change). The film has certainly fed into contemporary debate, and has been referred to, and engaged with by practitioners and academics in an international sphere of climate activism, and heritage conservation (e.g: Edmund Rice Centre Australia, Climate Outreach Information Network, Newport Restoration Foundation). I was asked to do a radio interview as a result of a film screening (BBC Radio Cymru), and consulted about a forthcoming Welsh-language documentary series on climate change (by Tinopolis, for S4C, forthcoming in 2016).

CONNECTED worked in partnership with two students from The University of The West of England (UWE) Julia Vaccina Makar and Kye Ottley, to make the film, aimed at non-expert laypeople. The students worked from a series of images and other information supplied by a number of researchers working in African countries. The animation draws attention to the impact of plant disease in crops in Sub-Saharan African countries and the importance of using diagnostic techniques to monitor disease spread. The film explains that CONNECTED provide training in diagnostic techniques to researchers across Sub-Saharan Africa, and that they in turn are sharing this knowledge with others. It also conveys the fact that CONNECTED fund research projects to learn more about plant health and that the CONNECTED is building a global network of researchers, sharing expertise to improve food security across Africa. Students Julia Vaccina Makar and Kye Ottley were successful in a process which saw students pitch to the CONNECTED Network to create a film which, with the co-operation of their tutors, would form a key component of their second year of studies.

We translated this basic information into a number of languages including English, Hindi and Kaanada for the printed flyers. In collaboration with MARAA, a community organisation based in Bangalore, India, we interacted with residents of the DJ Halli slums in Bangalore, India, in order to disseminate information about local food centres provided by the government. The process brought us into closer contact with NGO's and other concerned groups working on issues affecting this community.

July 2013 marked the tragic death of a five-year-old girl due to malnutrition in the DJ Halli slum in Bangalore, India's IT Capital. In October 2013 we met with the mother and sister of the deceased in DJ Halli and witnessed developments in governmental policies since the widespread (negative) media coverage. The government run food schemes (Anganwadi centres) are at the centre of the debates about food security legislation.

In this location, co-production methods and workshops using media technologies posed more problems than practical solutions; these methods were not appropriate for the set of social concerns or working with community members in this space. In the process, we learned about the complicated terrain of the slum spaces, where laws and other regulations do not apply and where information becomes particularly slippery.","Artefact (including digital)","2013","This creative production confronted the research questions by testing the limits of legal discourse, as well as the limits of digital media. Within this slum, having access to a basic mobile phone is a luxury and even a point-and-shoot camera in an environment of poverty such as this emphasises hierarchies and power relations, making participatory media production more invasive than usual. 

Attempting to address more challenging spaces and to navigate various means of communication within spaces such as these may be the only way to adequately test the limits and limitations of digital media. In addition, communities facing basic needs related to access to food, water, sanitation, and basic medical care potentially have the most to gain from the information that digital media might provide. In the case of the DJ Halli slums, the residents face challenges in all of these areas at once. Using our methods of media production, we found ourselves better able to address one concern at a time, such as pressing concerns around access to water.",,"5464aca872aff8.66241869","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5464aca872aff8.66241869&grantRef=AH%2FL503575%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/L503575/1","AA75A4BD-A206-4D34-9596-523753408BA9","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","62580E99-E31A-4E24-BE55-39CEE4C682D5"

At the event, five scientists were paired up with five local poets. The scientists were tasked with presenting their research and the poet shared one or more poems inspired by the science. Each pair of scientists and poets presented their work together. UKESM core group member Lee de Mora represented the UK Earth System Model, paired with the poet Ben Smith from the English department of the University of Plymouth. Rather than discussing the results of previous generation models or the study of climate change, we instead decided to use the Crosscurrents event to discuss lesser known aspects of Earth System models. We focused our presentation on the complexity required of the UKESM, the process of model development, and our current progress on the ocean spin up; topics which are rarely discussed with non-experts.","Creative Writing","2017","On the night of the event, there was a fantastic turnout, filling the PML lecture theatre.

which globally is considered as a third world country. One of those
implications unlike the weather effects is gender violence among the
Ugandan citizens. In Uganda for at least the last decade has seen the rise
of gender injustice. The fact is: the economy of Uganda has been affected
by climate change especially with how the families earn money or access
opportunities to put food on the table.
This abstract art piece is born out of the challenges the family faces when
money is tight or if they have to be forced to move due to massive floods,
destruction of farms etc. Usually the man is seen as the bread winner in
the house especially in the less fortunate homes so when the income is
low the woman usually lacks the necessary items to either care for the
family or get the basic needs. This causes a rift with the man who intern
gets frustrated because he worries about how to get money to feed his
family and he gets scared that his wife will leave him for another man
who is well off. This leads to gender violence and the woman being
beaten fiercely. This leads the woman to cry on her own without any help
or little help. This can be seen in the art piece with the woman shedding
tears which fill up and consume her life in the end with the dark hand
over her mouth.
Women live in fear of reporting this injustice to the authorities because of
fear of being left alone or even being killed in the process. With the
corruption and impunity within the system, the women who suffer aren't
really cared for even so the men who inflict this pain aren't afraid of the
law catching up to them thus this issue goes unsolved leaving the
women powerless to stand up for themselves.","Artwork","2021","Development of a creative community of practice addressing climate actions in Uganda",,"6228660d850b10.89043431","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6228660d850b10.89043431&grantRef=MR%2FS015299%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/S015299/1","C07ABA12-38CD-4110-87F4-80C176EC5254","5807F429-7BF0-4E42-917E-D4ADF5399E7B","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","EECFB85C-8835-4446-A089-B5E71DA0F278"

The sound recording was by the project's creative collaborator, Richard Gott. The film specifically addresses the ways in which climate change affects heritage in the low-lying island nation of Kiribati. It does this by bringing together diverse perspectives through a sequence of interview clips with the President, cultural officer, community members, activists, and scholars in Kiribati. These are layered with a visual representation of the landscape and culture. 'Troubled Waters' may begin to redefine the very concept of heritage, which is presented as inextricably connected to land and the natural environment in Kiribati.","Film/Video/Animation","2015","The film has been shown in its entirety, or as a series of clips in several public events and academic conferences, detailed separately. It is hard to prove a change in public perception (which is an overt aim of the project), but audiences have reported that they had not previously considered climate change as affecting culture (or fully acknowledged how culture frames the experience of climate change). The film has certainly fed into contemporary debate, and has been referred to, and engaged with by practitioners and academics in an international sphere of climate activism, and heritage conservation (e.g: Edmund Rice Centre Australia, Climate Outreach Information Network, Newport Restoration Foundation). I was asked to do a radio interview as a result of a film screening (BBC Radio Cymru), and consulted about a forthcoming Welsh-language documentary series on climate change (by Tinopolis, for S4C, forthcoming in 2016). The film has also promoted creative practice as a research methodology, achieving recognition in the AHRC Research in Film Awards, with a short clip screened at the British Film Institute.","https://vimeo.com/130445697","56e070836ad252.42410798","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=56e070836ad252.42410798&grantRef=AH%2FM006263%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/M006263/2","AFF28DCD-1A03-4C32-89DE-22563BED5126","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","1A469850-02BA-4814-81EE-E60C851CABC3","4CF85828-F700-48BE-850E-BB1E5AA16413"

Women and children are the most disadvantaged parties. Psychologically, husbands who are burdened by economic pressure will make women as wives get physical, verbal, mental and even sexual violence. Women are lined up to be the first to be responsible for taking a quick action in a disaster. Taking care of children, taking care of the house and making a living are done at the same time. This conditions result in less time remaining for women to access training and skills development for them, in the end positioned women as powerless objects, against the powerful patriarchal culture of this country.

This was very much a culmination of the senior fellowship, looking at the role of digital technology in understanding and managing the natural environment, and drawing on the large body of research we have worked on collectively over the past five years. The festival also built on the insights we have gained around the role of arts and creativity in not just conveying often complex scientific concepts and messages, but also enabling deeper engagement with a range of audiences including the general public, children and those responsible for decision-making in the crucial area of environmental change.

The festival was particularly inspired by the final year of the project when we have been focussing on the complexity of ecosystems and the need for more systems thinking in tackling such complexities - hence the name 'Entangled'. The festival featured a range of offerings drawing from the wide range of themes we have worked on during the five years of the senior fellowship. Our research experience was captured in our: 'conversations' (featuring some of the great people we have met and worked with over the project, in the format of chat shows); 'inspirations' (our 'thoughts for the day' by inspirational people that again we have worked with, intended to stimulate debate throughout the week); and 'threads' (capturing the entangled journeys and golden threads from the perspectives of different team members). We had a wide range of educational activities targeting members of the public and seeking to promote a message of transdisciplinarity and the excitement of science within our schools, e.g. see our Biodiversity Logbooks activities. The festival also featured a range of artistic events, including 5 commissioned works of art drawing on core themes that we had extracted from our work.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2021","This was a major event and it reached an audience way beyond the traditional academic audience. For example, we issues 67 tweets reaching an audience of over 14,000 people. During the week, we have over 7,000 visits to our website. We interacted with 577 members of the public at our festival hub located on Morecambe prom, and so on.

This poster documents the process of developing a spatial networks impact assessment library (snail) to provide productive implementations of reusable abstractions over a methodology that has so far been implemented using lower-level software libraries to solve the concrete problems at hand. Climate hazards pose increasing risks to people and society. Impact assessment uses probabilistic estimates of various hazards (fire, flood, landslide) to calculates the exposure, vulnerability and risk. In particular, parts of infrastructure networks (roads, power grid, water supply) may be directly exposed to climate hazards, with knock-on indirect effects on people, society, firms and the economy, which may be much wider than the direct impact on a single stretch of road or electricity substation. snail provides a reusable library for analysis, setting clear data requirements and implementing the details of probabilistic spatial network failure analysis given a spatial network, usage, vulnerabilities and hazards. It aims to support developer-users who will use and extend this to implement specific analyses, and may build it into more end-user-friendly toolkits or platforms.

This engagement tool has been co-designed in a close-nit collaboration between Leapfrog and the Newbold Trust - a small social enterprise committed to sustainability in the beautiful North East of Scotland. They went through a process of renewal and they wanted to involve local communities in the renewal of their facilities, as well as in the re-shaping of their identity. After a series of workshops, where walking became the vehicle to engage with several communities, the tool was conceived to capture the insights of the participants of a deliberative walk. Here, a deliberative walk refers to a facilitated walk which aims to create the space for collective reflection about issues where social and physical dimensions converge. The tool comprises a set of three postcards (purpose postcards, reflective postcards and send-us-a-postcard) and an envelope that together enable practitioners to engage in different ways and in different levels of engagement during a facilitated walk to explore the physical resources aimed for renewal.","Artefact (including digital)","2017","The tool from this project helped the people involved to understand their physical resources from different perspectives by making new connections with another people and understanding how they looked at the spaces.

Statement:

Can people be reduced in an extreme process of commodification to objects? What is the process that numbering and data mining generates within a societal context? Is the extreme consequence of unchecked ideological forms of contemporary capitalism driving illogical syllogisms to their ultimate destination?

Beyond the simple binary of nationalist and unionist, the best of this work has teased out how the conflict was experienced through modalities of gender, class and geography. It has challenged state and community surveillance, and pointed to overlooked everyday experiences. More recently art, especially in community-based reconciliation projects, has provided voice to victims, broken down the barriers between previously antagonistic communities and embodied reconciliatory concepts around interdependence and dialogue. 

This almost three decades of arts practice, some of this work has gained global recognition, and is held in regional and national collections, including Wolverhampton Art Gallery, Tate, National Museums NI (NMNI), Imperial War Museum (IWM), the Linen Hall Library, Arts Council NI, British Film Institute and Live Art Development Agency as well as small regional arts and community organisations. However, these collections are geographically dispersed across the UK, difficult to access, and, in many cases, at risk of disappearing. At best, where individual art works are held in national and international collections they are often insufficiently documented, understood and promoted as assets that have emerged as the product of sustained artistic engagement with the British-Irish conflict.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2020","From prominent visual artworks and collections (Colin Davidson's Silent Testimony, 2015; Golden Thread's Collective Histories of Northern Ireland Art), to regional theatre and performance (Kabosh, Theatre of Witness, The Derry Playhouse and Peace Academy) to film and photography (Northern Ireland 30 Years of Photography, Belfast Exposed and The MAC, 2014), music and carnival arts (Beyond Skin, Beat Initiative), these diverse yet distinctive practices employ art as a critical medium through which to challenge standardised representations of the conflict.",,"6046403f423455.87156069","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6046403f423455.87156069&grantRef=AH%2FP014178%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P014178/1","1DF6C700-AFCB-4736-80A3-DA81EE9BBCA6","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","A0A585E0-6B0D-4643-A3A6-47943B4CBFEF","8F9ECBAC-1A2A-4FB5-8BF0-379CA661B094"

Sharing co-design methods and tools for engagement, in July 2016 the Summer School aimed to develop Early Career Researchers' (ECRs) capabilities in carrying out Action Research with communities and to stimulate discussion and debate around the academic and societal impact of these approaches. Taking place at the Institute of Design Innovation at The Glasgow School of Art in Forres, Moray, 20 delegates from fields of design, architecture, health and social care, and community development took part in a series of paper presentations, discussions, and creative workshops to enrich their understandings and applications of Action Research in community settings. Featuring presentations from the wider Leapfrog team, the Summer School also welcomed a series of international speakers who delivered keynotes and lightning talks across the event. Areas of discussion included Action research, participation, and co- production with communities; design-led methods and tools in Action Research; relationships, power, and ethics; engaging with diverse and minority communities; moving across disciplinary boundaries; case studies of research with the public, private, and third sectors; innovative research outputs; collaborative evaluation and dissemination; and the value, impact, legacies, and sustainability of these approaches This program of activities offered an inspirational and supportive space for a network of ECRs to exchange insights on broader aspects of research and career development, including approaches to generating research questions, writing research bids, and dissemination to diverse public audiences, and to consider how they might work together in the future.","Film/Video/Animation","2016","Aiming to provide an insight into the experience of participating in a Leapfrog Summer School, the film was launched in February 2016 to accompany and promote the current call for participation in the 2017 Summer School, taking place in July at Lancaster University under the theme of Exploring Community Engagement for Research: Power, Impact, &amp; Collaboration.","https://player.vimeo.com/video/204044871","58c2771d088bb5.86496710","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=58c2771d088bb5.86496710&grantRef=AH%2FM001296%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/M001296/1","C0D94F0F-EE90-4FCD-9F93-AEA1878B9ABE","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","3535DDAC-E8D5-49B6-89F8-9D4585B72B80"

The posters accessibly present research findings on a range of topics, from the origins of the Victorian park movement and the founding stories of several of Leeds's best known parks, to patterns of visiting and visitor experience today, to the funding challenges and future sustainability of public parks moving into the future. Three of the posters are aimed specifically at children, and present the basic findings in each of these areas in an especially accessible manner. These attractively presented posters feature original photographs of park life, past and present, besides diagrams and infographics reporting the major findings from the survey of park users.

As a means to gather real-time data, tourists using their smart phones can avail of Augmented Reality experiences, multi-lingual location-based-marketing and wayfinding that integrates within public transport systems. By providing an enhanced and customised experience to visitors as they navigate throughout city, all data, geo-locations and time-stamps are collated and visually presented with the AR360 dashboard. Development of powerful data visualisation will allow major city stakeholders to access real-time information that allows them to better protect their brand image, customise and refine their proposition and essentially become a smarter city.

Major cities worldwide endeavour to become smarter in how they integrate information and communication technology and various physical devices connected to IoT networks to optimise the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens and visitors. The measurement of traffic flow, air quality etc is achieved through a network of sensors and the gathering of metrics. AR360 provides access to real time and aggregated visitor behaviour data to address the challenge of the tourism industry which has tended to operate off data that is published 6-9 months after the event. 

AR360 works via a multi-lingual smartphone app, providing a series of AR experiences that can be tailored to different cities. In Belfast, visitors can design and race their own virtual DeLorean car while waiting for their bus to arrive, or they can see a full scale recreation of Titanic in its original dock and at the Belfast Peace Walls, they can use the app to walk along a virtual, interactive timeline to learn more about the city's history and the Good Friday Agreement.","Artefact (including digital)","2020","User engagement with objects and information

The artwork was inspired by notions of hard labour and economic exploitation, which provided the conceptual underpinning for an exhibition and a public performance in Southampton from June 7 to June 12, 2014.

Statement:

Can people be reduced in an extreme process of commodification to objects? What is the process that numbering and data mining generates within a societal context? Is the extreme consequence of unchecked ideological forms of contemporary capitalism driving illogical syllogisms to their ultimate destination?

The processes of extreme contemporary commodification together with systems of data collections that are neatly boxing within pre-conceived frameworks a wide range of human activities are embedded within capitalistic ideological frameworks of exploitation of society and the masses within it. This conjunction is re-introducing within contemporary post-society Medieval concepts of abuse that marketed as 'necessary' or 'empowering' create new categories: neo-serfs, micro-thievery on global scale or legal unethical exploitations.

Site-specific Composition for Soprano and Tenor, Pisa Baptistery, Italy.","This site-specific composition was designed for an interplay of voices within the acoustics of the Pisa Baptistery (Battistero di San Giovanni). The reverberation time of the Baptistery can reach up to 15 seconds, offering a vast space of time to handle sustained notes. Its reverb sound is created through different resonant frequencies, also offering a unique texture. The composition, therefore, explores chords created only by two voices, leaves gaps of silence so the listeners can focus on the reverb sound, interacts with the room's main resonant frequency and develops a sense of a quasi-static texture. The chosen tuning was A on 432Hz, due to this frequency being close to the room's main resonant frequency and for its relationship with the rotation of the Earth around the sun, which is 136.10Hz (C#).

The title, Voices of Earth and Sky, refers to the singer's voices and the Baptistery's resonance coming from the dome. It's a dialogue between sounds of the ground and of higher structures, as well as earth and sky.","Composition/Score","2017","An audio and 360 video recording was taken on the site 20/04/2017 and is available from YouTube.

The idea is to create an outdoor corridor gallery along the high street in Borth, by projecting footage which explores the effects of sea-level rise on communities across the world. The project will involve local residents, including the people who live in the houses on the street and those who have been involved with the Borth flood defence schemes.

&quot;We want to draw parallels between flooding and climate migration here in the UK and globally, creating lots of difficult but necessary conversations about the different scales of the disaster, the cause, the implications, etc. These are transferable as they relate to other towns in similar situations as flooding worsens across the UK and the world&quot;.


Water Water Everywhere (part 1)

We are a group of artists interested in flooding induced migration, a topic affecting both us, here on the coast of Wales, and communities globally in places like Kirobas in the Islands of the South Pacific. 

We have designed three events to get people talking about Borth, flooding and the future.

Our first Water Water Everywhere event took place on the beach in Borth on the 26th August. Led by Anne and Bodge, holiday makers and other beach-goers made the town of Borth out of sand and found objects until the incoming tide washed the town into the sea.
While crafting and playing we talked about Borth, flooding, storms, the sea defences and asked participants to imagine what will happen to the sea side town in the future, when the sea defences have stopped working.

Video interviews from this workshop will coming up in next next posts... along with more information about the next two events...

The other participants include: Tom Gunn (fine art photographer), Alex Randall (Climate Outreach Information Network), Helen Kennedy, Anne Ferris, and Bodge (all community arts practitioners),","Artefact (including digital)","2015","TBC","http://www.cymerau.org/newyddion--news/water-water-everywhere-part-1","56e01c7524dc01.30101874","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=56e01c7524dc01.30101874&grantRef=AH%2FL008165%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/L008165/1","319980DA-7C8B-4185-A297-FD917A8914FC","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","1A469850-02BA-4814-81EE-E60C851CABC3","E79C195E-5FDC-4927-8DB9-9CF63452A3D0"

The suitcases support face-to-face and mediated encounters and the valorization of existing relations within a locality. The design of the suitcases emphasise choice and reciprocity through a process of 'asking' and 'giving', formulating questions to inspire story telling and nominating people to hand a suitcase to. With their thoughtful material design, travelling suitcases are specifically designed to draw people in reflective processes and engage with fellow citizens' personal narratives and perspectives.

The suitcases technical system was chosen to make the system as accessible as possible-tailored for low media and digital literacy skills, and to upload media content online in areas where there is very low or inexistent wi-fi network and accessibility. For this reason an Interactive Voice Responsive system was chosen. The suitcase comprised a GSM phone in a 3D printed case, which allowed the recoding and uploading of media content online without the need for an internet connection. Suitcase comes with its associated webpage where all content can be accessed (and curate it). 

Process 
A 'Travelling Suitcase' is given to a citizen who is prompted to record a story s/he wants to share with others. Then the citizen is invited to pick an envelope and write something about the story recorded and added it to the top of the suitcase. S/he is then prompted to choose someone else to hand the suitcase to and formulate a question to inspire storytelling. In this way the suitcase travels person to person till the last envelope that prompts to handing the suitcase back to the initiator of the process.

Technical system 
For the purpose of building a robust, sustainable (in terms of monetary costs and technical expertise needed to use and maintain it) and reliable system for the collection of place-related stories and their community dissemination an IVR system was designed and developed. A number of communications frameworks have been reviewed for this (including asterisk and freeswitch) but for the purpose of this project a more reliable and quick solution was chosen - an already running cloud communications service (e.g. twilio.com and nexmo.com). One ten digit number was purchased per suitcase; each call is redirected to an Apache server (on an Ubuntu installation hosted at digitalocean.com/) where a PHP script serves a VoiceXML file with instructions of how the call should be handled (menu options, voice clips etc.); if the user chooses to record a message the story is being recorded and stored on the server; if the user chooses to listen to a message, a random (or sorted) story is being fetched by the server and played back to the user; the messages can be accessed by either calling the equivalent phone number or visiting erithwalks.co.uk.","Artefact (including digital)","2015","The residents and the housing institution were able to collect and distribute place-based stories about the multiple practices and values in and about their estate undergoing urban regeneration.

The National Coal Mining Museum has supported our research in the loan of material from their archives to Manchester Metropolitan University's Special Collections in between various phases of lockdown - including a mad dash across the Pennines in advance of the second lockdown in November 2020. This museum-to-museum loan enabled us and our students access to artefacts that would otherwise have been impossible to work with. The exhibition presents a historic timeline of the Yorkshire Coalfield, a summary of its geography and networks and a series of case studies of the architecture, landscape and environmental qualities of Kellingley Colliery , Gascoigne Wood Mine, Drax, Eggborough and Ferrybridge power stations and the ash mound of Gale Common. Together these show the interrelation of huge industrial processes in extraction, power production and waste management and their combined impact on a landscape, its cultures and societies. A series of models focus on particular themes that we have used to consider the changing landscape - the visual relationships between the infrastructure of motorways and power stations; the international, national and regional networks involved in power production; the planning and reality of processes of landscape formation over extended periods of time; and the work of landscape architects to integrate recreational functions with infrastructure. Alongside the models and drawings, a short powerful film captures the spirit of the birth, life and death of these sites and asks about the landscape futures as an industry fades with little attention to its heritage.

Culicoides biting midges inflict substantial economic damage on global livestock production and trade by acting as vectors of arboviral pathogens. The hypothesis that our project addresses is that genetic variation within species influences the vector competence of Culicoides for BTV strains and hence impacts upon the epidemiology of this virus worldwide. The primary deliverable of this project is the elucidation of the genetic basis of vector competence of C. sonorensis for bluetongue virus (BTV). It will also generate the first accurately annotated genome of a Culicoides species worldwide opening up vast opportunities for comparative genomics. This will provide fundamental insights into arbovirus: Culicoides systems that to date remain poorly characterised. The genome sequence will underpin advances in improving food security by protecting UK agriculture from potentially catastrophic exotic animal diseases. There is significant potential for this research to facilitate the development of new control strategies for these important animal diseases, with consequences for agricultural practice and food security, both in the UK and worldwide.

While the primary focus of the project is academic, a range of different groups will additionally benefit from the results, and we have formulated plans to engage them in the project. One of the principal approaches for the dissemination of the outputs for this project has been the production of animated videos funded by the &quot;Excellence with Impact&quot; competition. This novel approach of using animations to describe our work to a general audience goes above and beyond the intended scientific audience of the project. This has also been of interest to the Animal Health Industry who will benefit through the production by engaging with the public.
The animations have also been used in outreach activities to ensure that Farmers and Veterinarians benefit from the project, by gaining a deeper understanding of Culicoides and the pathogens they transmit. The high profile nature of the incursion of recent BTV-8 incursions has facilitated an opportunity to provide background information to farmers and veterinarians on what was until recently viewed as exotic pathogens of little relevance to the UK. We intend to build on this advance by further engagement across the veterinary and farming stakeholders, by detailing significant findings made during the project and how we intend to turn research into practice.
Finally, we will engage with the Schools who will have an interest in both the advanced nature of the techniques involved in the study (STEM) and the high profile of Culicoides as an insect vector group in the UK. We will exploit this unique opportunity through the animated videos to both promote the objectives of BBSRC and explore this area of science in an understandable fashion. Scientists employed during the project are encouraged to take part in public engagement. In addition, the entomology group has wide experience of outreach activities through a variety of events run primarily with the Royal Entomological Society and the animated videos will also be utilised for this engagement. Exhibit materials, including the animated videos, will be used in further outreach and in open days for The Pirbright Institute, TGAC and EBI. Finally, our laboratory is already involved in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) activities for schools.

The National Coal Mining Museum has supported our research in the loan of material from their archives to Manchester Metropolitan University's Special Collections in between various phases of lockdown - including a mad dash across the Pennines in advance of the second lockdown in November 2020. This museum-to-museum loan enabled us and our students access to artefacts that would otherwise have been impossible to work with. The exhibition presents a historic timeline of the Yorkshire Coalfield, a summary of its geography and networks and a series of case studies of the architecture, landscape and environmental qualities of Kellingley Colliery , Gascoigne Wood Mine, Drax, Eggborough and Ferrybridge power stations and the ash mound of Gale Common. Together these show the interrelation of huge industrial processes in extraction, power production and waste management and their combined impact on a landscape, its cultures and societies. A series of models focus on particular themes that we have used to consider the changing landscape - the visual relationships between the infrastructure of motorways and power stations; the international, national and regional networks involved in power production; the planning and reality of processes of landscape formation over extended periods of time; and the work of landscape architects to integrate recreational functions with infrastructure. Alongside the models and drawings, a short powerful film captures the spirit of the birth, life and death of these sites and asks about the landscape futures as an industry fades with little attention to its heritage.

Being the Capital city, all people can be found in this City with most of them leaving villages to make a better life in this hub of business. There's congestion in the city and plans to have all commuter taxis and motorcycles shift from the main city have never been implemented due to political reasons. The streets during rush hours are impassable. The streets are also occupied by street children; mainly those who fled their homes during the Civil war that ravaged the Northern part of Uganda. Roadside hawkers (mostly women) roam the streets for survival. The City is located around the central part of Uganda which receives heavy rainfall due to Lake Victoria and River Nile that are close by. Due to it's geography, it experiences flash floods and roads are always inaccessible and homes in the slums are inhabitable. Due to the high levels of unemployment, most children are forced to work in sand mines that are located in the suburbs. These sandmines collapse sometimes and lives are lost. Being a city of the poor, women are targeted by rapists and even killed. These Climate Change and Gender Injustices have plagued a city that has given away most of its green landscapes to foreign developers. The Agency responsible for Environment Protection has been described as &quot;toothless&quot; on many occasions because it has failed to execute it's mandate. And also little has been done by the Ministry of Gender, Labor and Social Development in ensuring that women are supported and protected in the city and across the Country. More ways have to be used to call for action and implement measures to remove all forms of Injustice against women. I have been involved in small campaigns as a student to call for justice for example justice for girls that were being sexually harassed by lecturers. I have also been involved in environment protection activities by planting trees and supporting the use of reusable paper bags across businesses. This is what I have done on a personal level and I hope through partnerships with other activists we can bring about behavioral changes in our communities in the city and the whole of Uganda.&quot;","Creative Writing","2021","Development of a creative community of practice addressing climate actions in Uganda.",,"622863a371dc06.68741281","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=622863a371dc06.68741281&grantRef=MR%2FS015299%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/S015299/1","C07ABA12-38CD-4110-87F4-80C176EC5254","5807F429-7BF0-4E42-917E-D4ADF5399E7B","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","EECFB85C-8835-4446-A089-B5E71DA0F278"

The video included spoken word in a combination of English and Afrikaans as the main audience is majority Afrikaans. It also includes subtitles. The film is available for download, so fishermen will be able to circulate it on Whatsapp and have it as a resource on their phones.

Diep Respek is an ode to the deep sea and hopes to more deeply connect fishermen with the mysterious worlds below, notably the Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems - or VMEs. These are parts of the ocean floor that are fundamental to the sustainability of our fisheries. They constitute a wide diversity of organisms that provide habitats for young fish and eggs, and other creatures. These ecosystems are highly sensitive to disturbance from trawling operations as the organisms are slow-growing and long-lived, and once trawled, may take two to three generations to recover, at least. To limit disturbance, trawlers off the coast of South Africa are adopting a system where they stop fishing and move to another area if they catch too many VME indicator taxa. For this system to work efficiently, crew members must have a good understanding of the indicator taxa and ultimately a personal desire to preserve these ecosystems.","Film/Video/Animation","2021","Video was featured in a blog of the South Africa Deep-Sea Trawling Industry Association, which noted that the video was &quot;spreading quickly among fishing crews working in South Africa's trawl fishery for hake.&quot;

Our project employed performance-led, studio-based, participatory action-research methods. These involved reflective practice and centred on meaning-making. The interdisciplinary nature of the team necessitated and facilitated a mixed-methods approach to research development, analysis and interpretation. Our methodological underpinning combined applied drama practice and analytical methods. 



The project's central premise was that the creation of a theatre company could provide a useful modelling-method of how communities can be formed and thrive. Such a company would offer a performative space within which new ways of behaving, relating to one another, and dealing with responsibilities, could be imagined and embodied, accepted and rejected, tested and revised. This would be shaped by a shared trust while being sustained by a continued collective, creative collaboration, enabling the whole company to create and share performances with an audience and workshop participants. 

The core question - 'Community? What do you mean?' - was central to the project's research approach. Throughout the facilitator-researchers continually re-evaluated how explicitly the research question need to be expressed to the participants and what impact direct questioning might have on the participants' response. (Discussed below).

 

Output Activities:

The project's activities were grouped into three phases: Initiation, Consolidation and Development. Initiation: finding company members

• Planning with Devon County Council and research team.



• Two, day-long, taster workshops: invitation sent to young people leaving care across the South West via an email flyer. This was communicated via their individual care workers who were invaluable advocates throughout the project. 13 young people attended: (6 &amp; 7), along with 4 (2 &amp; 2) adult social-care workers and a drama facilitation team of 4 at each event with one member of the research team as participant observer.","Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)","2012","The young people leaving care, who have become the core participators in this project have been working with Exstream Theatre Company and University of Exeter post-graduate students for almost 12 months now - well beyond the original scope of the project. During this time they have been able to collaboratively create a community. This community has taken the form of a theatre company which includes them and reflects them. We would argue that, although challenging for all involved, the performative nature of the theatre-as-community offers something unique to its participants. It is a real community, operating in real time, where participants are themselves. Simultaneously, it also holds open a space where they can 'perform' life with less risk: they can try out, problematise and modify other scenarios built on their own sense of (future) identity and community. In their testing of these other possible realities, they are scaffolding from what they know to create an alternate future in reality. Their growth as people and community members has become clear through their public performances. They have been empowered by this experience. This is evident in their fundraising efforts to help the whole company travel together to perform in Austin, Texas in March 2013.",,"m-7183062887.921057a7193e78","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=m-7183062887.921057a7193e78&grantRef=AH%2FJ012092%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/J012092/1","0E8BCE16-710E-4B08-8534-9432443E0944","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","D03EDA3F-CD16-4ADB-886D-61B39D894293"

Digitisation has included 2d capture of a wide range of content, 3d capture of objects and digitisation of AV formats that were previously not viewable (in any form). Through the digitisation of these assets we - and others- are also able to use them for research, reuse and inspiration, and make new artistic, curatorial and creative products derived from them more widely available. This has been achieved through initiatives such as 360 exhibitions (also viewable in VR with Cap Co kit), persistent VR exhibitions and augmented reality apps created for use in educational workshops etc.","Artefact (including digital)","2021","Impacts have included the capture and dissemination of unique archival resources, the support of projects such as the two Wellcome Research Resources projects: Challenging Archives and Wildfilm and other digital innovation projects, and a greater ability to share our content with new audiences. For example, the digitisation infrastructure has enabled us to prepare and loan digitised AV content to other museums and galleries for use in their exhibitions. More significantly, by digitally capturing items (including very fragile 3D items) , for the first time we are able to take these digitised archive items out of our institution and into school and other non-traditional educational settings. A current example is the Making a Scene Digital Innovation and Engagement project.","https://theatrecollection.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/category/making-a-scene-a-digital-innovation-and-engagement-project/","6230f019be7df0.67528841","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6230f019be7df0.67528841&grantRef=AH%2FV011839%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/V011839/1","13E02EF9-DD23-4D1C-9CE1-8E24DF6D2F6B","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","89C9F263-57BA-447C-9739-C903FB7CCFE0"

The Gold Matter's project activities include research with miners to understand how they see the future and sustainability in gold mining. This has involved photography, painting and sculpture to find ways to express people's lives and futures in mining. At the start, the intention was to have an exhibition that could travel and 'pop-up' in mining communities, including artwork created in these communities, to stimulate debate about gold mining. Photos show how the exhibition began like this in Kejetia, northern Ghana, in January 2020. However, the Covid-19 pandemic put a halt to plans for the exhibition to pop up in other communities or countries. Now it pops-up virtually as the Exhibition Gold Matters. The Exhibition takes the audience down on a journey moving from 'Exhibition of the Exhibition in Kejetia' to visual results from all the three regions organized around the themes: Co-labouring, ARTistic and ARTisanal, In-depth terrains, Gold Lifeways and Moving Matters. The exhibition includes work by the photographer Nii Obodai and images by the painter Christophe Sawadogo. All the other visual materials result from research collaborations, often involving members of mining communities. We have taken care over consent; also, in order to protect individuals, names of people and places are not always specified. The exhibition is a collaborative effort of the Team and members of mining communities. The Gold Matters Team would like to acknowledge gratitude to the miners and community members who have made this exhibition possible.

Holding a Grain of Sand - Carrying the Moon - Splitting Earth



Robert Hooke, a contemporary of Isaac Newtown is considered to be the forerunner of Microscopic research. His book Micrographia - of small bodies [1665] was shocking in its day, showing a wide public images of things not visible to the naked eye, most famously his large scale drawing of a flea.

Observing the world through microscopes has fundamentally revolutionised our perception. With this in mind we developed a project in collaboration with Professor Daniela Schmidt, a leading scientist in climate research at Bristol University. 

A paleobiologist, her research of Foreminifara fossils going back many millions of years, allows her to build a timeline of historic climate change, the temperatures of oceans, the chemical makeup of oceans and the CO2 in the atmosphere historically. This information is key to understanding how our climate might change in the future and the implications of that.

For our RTSFX project, the most encouraging thing was the number of people that interacted with our sound effects demo and how easily they grasped the concept, even if they had no experience in the area. This was the aim of the project - to engage non-technical people in a conversation about sound synthesis and why it is worth pursuing - to help them understand its potential and encourage more interest / investment in synthesis research.

Around the same time / just after Sonar our sound effects website was presented to industry professionals (sound designers working on film/tv), and observing so many non-technical people playing with the site at Sonar helped me understand better the way people will interact with it and lead to some tweaks being made to make the experience more reliable and enjoyable.","https://sonar.es/en/2016/","58ac4d8a21f363.98575206","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=58ac4d8a21f363.98575206&grantRef=EP%2FK009559%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K009559/1","C91260A5-64E5-4C41-8BDE-CD140D7A1ECF","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","2D1D7ADD-45F8-4B1A-89C5-9D33EAA1E795"

The exhibition (running until 5 June 2022) includes two paintings, twenty-four drawings, and a group of prints, either executed by Parmigianino himself or in collaboration with others. It is accompanied by a catalogue which presents The Courtauld's outstanding collection of works by Parmigianino.

In preparation for the exhibition and catalogue, new photography and technical examinations were carried out. Technical examination, making use of a new multi-spectral comparator funded by this AHRC award, utilised UV and infra-red scanning to reveal two new drawings that were previously unknown, hidden underneath their historic mounts. Similar exploratory work has also helped to identify connections between some of the drawings and the finished paintings for which they were conceived.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2022","The discovery of two new drawings by Parmigianino make an immediate impact on the artist's known catalogue raisonn&eacute; and, combined with new technical examination, will influence future scholarship.

The exhibition was curated and presented in-progress research led by Rico and supported by Harrison on the 'echoes' or 'afterlives' of the Huemul Atomic Project, an early attempt to develop nuclear fusion technology which was established in 1949 and ran for several years under conditions of extreme secrecy on Isla Huemul, within Nahuel Haupi National Park, the oldest national park in Argentina. Their work has involved archaeological and ethnographic research on the Huemul Atomic Project, its material remains and their subsequent uses.
The Balseiro Institute is the most prestigious nuclear engineering and experimental physics research and teaching centre in Latin America, and was founded in 1955 under the direction of Jos&eacute; Antonio Balseiro, following his investigation into the Huemul Atomic Project's findings. Significant infrastructure from the Huemul Atomic Project was transferred from Isla Huemul and repurposed as part of the newly established Balseiro Institute. In addition to archaeological survey of the remains of the laboratories and other facilities on the island, Rico's work currently involves documenting these materials and their stories, whilst Harrison has been exploring the influence of contemporary and historical conservation practices on the broader landscape of the region, pursuing themes developed as part of his work on the linked AHRC-funded Heritage Futures research programme. The exhibition contributes to capacity building for interdisciplinary research on whole of landscape approaches to conservation in the region.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2017","The concept and content for the exhibition was co-developed earlier in the year at an international, interdisciplinary design charrette involving representatives from the Balseiro Institute, historians, architects and archaeologists from Chile, Argentina, the US and UK. The charrette was hosted by Dr Jorge Mu&ntilde;oz Sougarret at the Centro de Estudios del Desarrollo Local y Regional (CEDER) of the University of Los Lagos in Osorno, Chile, in May 2017. A key outcome of the charrette has been the establishment of the Restricted Access Research Network, an international, interdisciplinary group of scholars concerned with exploring the nexus between arts and humanities based and science based approaches to the interconnected histories of conservation and energy production within the region.
The exhibition will be on display in the Institute's Biblioteca Leo Falicov. Research assistance for the exhibition was provided by Dr Esther Breithoff (UCL), with further assistance from Mar&iacute;a de los &Aacute;ngeles Picone (Emory University), Laura Garcia Oviedo (Balseiro Institute) and Christina Martinez (Balseiro Institute).","https://heritage-futures.org/los-ecos-del-proyecto-huemul-exhibition-opens-in-argentina/","5a99496dabcfc9.24936985","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5a99496dabcfc9.24936985&grantRef=AH%2FP009158%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P009158/1","8FDFD8F7-E3AE-4740-96AF-C49668430C09","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","F9FBF8C2-9792-421D-807A-511148E44140"

The photos also show the field researchers and clinical researchers engaged with participants/patients, with striking emotion and human connection. Suphak also documented the difficult journeys that participants, their families and field researchers take across the border between their homes in rural Myanmar and the series of research clinics along the border. These journeys are especially harrowing during the rainy season. Because Suphak is herself a community health worker on our team, and native Karen Burmese, each photo includes detailed stories about the situation of individuals, families and research staff depicted. 

We sponsored two public exhibitions of Suphak's photos, the first at an art space in Bangkok, and the second at a clinic near the Thai-Myanmar border, where our research ethics study was based. These events reached more than 1,300 people and are described in detail in the public engagement section. The photos and time engaging with Suphak and other team members about the stories linked with the photos, offered an opportunity for members of the public to engage on the themes of research ethics, the role of ethics in addressing migrant disease burden, structural vulnerabilities of e.g., climate change and displacement, as well as resilience and hope.

It is composed entirely of user-generated content from diverse and geographically separated conservation communities across the UK. It features a variety of video, image, sound and text-based content, representing contributions from &gt;40 individuals.

A unique, dynamically generated introduction sequence (composed entirely from the user-generated content) sets the scene for the documentary and also introduces a suite of interactive navigational tools that help audiences explore and create their own interpretations of the content.

Rather than being a 'standalone' artefact, Red Tales integrates with existing ecologies, both online (via social media) and offline (via different co-located communities). Users can 'curate' and share collections of existing content, as well as add new content to a &quot;living&quot; documentary. Our aim was to reflect the heterogeneity of the content and the 'unresolved' nature of the topic. Thus, rather than presenting a linear narrative, audiences are invited to explore and contribute to the documentary through a technical framework and an interaction paradigm that builds equally upon recent research in documentary/media studies and human-computer interaction, and pioneering interactive documentaries (eg Bear71 / 18 Days in Egypt). 

Red Tales was produced through participatory workshops and developed in response to an ethnographic study of the community that revealed its inherent diversity, several shared concerns and hundreds of individuals' stories. In making the film, we adopted a collaborative, multidisciplinary and participatory approach and we have drawn upon - and hope to contribute new to knowledge to - the AHRC's digital-economy and knowledge-exchange programmes. 

Through making this film, we have gained unique insights into knowledge exchange methods that bridge the worlds of academia, industry and the voluntary/charity sectors and the role digital technology can play in forging new experiences, supporting grassroots communities and producing non-linear documentary narratives.","Film/Video/Animation","2015","Several articles in the mainstream press","http://www.redtales.co.uk","56dc187d312681.11386387","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=56dc187d312681.11386387&grantRef=AH%2FJ005150%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/J005150/1","8D6A32E4-3CED-4B0D-A347-3519BD1B3376","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","C8DB7FEF-A19A-4B3A-BCFA-CCD37A2B2445"

Opening on Thur, 7th Feb","The work exhibited focused on labour practices, the aesthetics of failure, planned obsolescence and the contemporary relevance of tradition, craft and skill. The work collectively reflects on the fragility of the material world and our bounded, physical, entanglements with it. As Elizabeth V. Spelman notes in her book 'Repair: The Impulse to Restore in a Fragile World' (2003): &quot;To think about repair requires us to recognize our own failures and imperfections and those of the world we live in&quot; (p. 138).

These imperfections in part, relate to what infrastructure scholar Steven Jackson calls 'broken world thinking', whereby life itself is constituted in relation to the care of existing 'things', as opposed to the continual invention of the new. This orientation is identified by Mierle Laderman Ukeles in her seminal 'Manifesto for Maintenance Art&quot; (1969) as the 'life instinct', which she describes as the eternal return to doing what is required for the maintenance, equilibrium and survival of all species. It is also expressed through the language of &quot;articulation work&quot; (Leigh Star and Strauss, 1999) or what Ingold (2013) calls 'thinking through stuff', and the lively knots that emerge when we make, mend and build.

The focus for the exhibition extends beyond the professional realm of arts and crafts into the daily labours involved in picking up, sorting out and dealing with dirt, the discarded and wasted. Ravi Agarwal, in the catalogue accompanying his Trace City series, places this conversation within the &quot;invisible terrains of marginality&quot; that make up our &quot;contemporary global understandings of an anthropogenic planetary future and ideas of progress&quot;.

Trace City, Ravi Agarwal

In the aura of everything marginal lies signs of our futures. Ravi Agarwal's Trace City series documents landfill sites in India. The image of the waste picker captures simultaneously the dignity of the worker and the deep caste, gender and class hierarchies that structure human societies.

The Body Marks #1, Teresa Dillon: The daily position that a shoe repairer takes on the streets in New Delhi becomes the focal point of the image, as the body's expression becomes inscribed on the pavement wall.

Kindle Glitched, Ben Gaulon: Exploring the aesthetics of planned obsolescence, Kindle Glitched is a series of broken Kindles donated, found or bought on eBay and signed by the artist. The defected images, resulting from the malfunctioning devices, are fixed onto the screens as a permanent display of failure.

Coded Boilersuit, Anna Mills: Coded Boilersuit explores how everyday white goods (washing machines, fridges) are increasingly becoming locked down, requiring diagnostic software to detect and fix the broken parts. As a result, maintenance workers are moving away from manual repair to becoming information technology specialists, whose privilege and skill lies in holding the permissions to unlock customised software. Visualising such standardisation across repair professions, the accompanying poster illustrates the normalisation and positioning of such change.

Figurine under repair in Helen Warren's Workshop, Steve Bond and Caitlin DeSilvey: Taken from the project Small is Beautiful? Visual and Material Cultures of Making and Mending, this image captures the frozen poetics of an object, waiting to be repaired at Helen Warren's workshop in Budleigh Salterton, Devon.

A Collection of Objects Representing Repair, Teresa Dillon, Caitlin DeSilvey and Steve Bond: As part of the Repair Acts programme 2018, three workshops took place in Bristol, New Delhi and Falmouth. At each workshop, participants were asked to bring with them an object which represented what 'repair' meant to them.

Small is Beautiful? Visual and Material Cultures of Making and Mending, Steve Bond and Caitlin DeSilvey: Small is Beautiful? was a two year (2010-2012) project in which two cultural geographers (Caitlin DeSilvey and James Ryan) and a photographer (Steven Bond) set out to find, visit and document workplaces in the South West where people fix broken things. The project resulted in a series of exhibitions, an on-line portfolio of images, and a publication (Visible Mending, Uniformbooks, 2013).

Vintage Amp Repair, Robert Leadbeater: As part of the preview evening, sound engineer and amp repairer Robert Leadbeater takes us through his practice, demonstrating the steps necessary for repairing a vintage Italian amplifier. On display will be a collection of valves from 1940's English radios.

Letterpress Collective, Printing Bike, Nick Hand: In 2013, Nick Hand from the Letterpress Collective, Bristol, asked his friend Robin Mather to build a bicycle that could carry an Adana 8&times;5 printing press. Following the footsteps of the Journeymen printers of the 18th century, Nick cycled from Bristol to Mainz printing along the way, in homage to Johannes Gutenberg (the inventor, in 1450, of printing with moveable type). In 2017, Nick cycled from Land's End to John o' Groats on the Printing Bike. On this journey Nick printed postcards in towns and cities, celebrating the objects and processes they were most famous for producing. On the opening night, Nick will be demonstrating how the bike works and creating a special one-off print.

My Square Mile, Teresa Dillon, Arthur Buxton and Carmela Pietrangelo: Over 2018, Teresa Dillon and Carmela Pietrangelo carried out research on the history of repair business within a square mile of Bristol city. Taking a 20-year time slice they explored business registers, insurance logs and archives for the years 1938, '58, '78, '98 and 2018. Working with print maker Arthur Buxton a selection of advertisements from these years, were recreated. The accompanying black and white symbols are extracts from various repair advertisements, which illustrate the changing trade associate symbols and seals of quality and assurance. Data generated from the project is also presented in the form of maps and graphs, which sit on the way into the gallery space

It was called The Twittering Machine, and seems to show a group of birds tethered to a hand cranked machine. Although there are many interpretations of this painting it can be said that it represents some kind of relationship between nature and industrialization, or perhaps a world where the work of man and the work of nature struggle to exist in some sort of harmony. The presence of a handle indicates that this delicate balance of nature and machine needs the hand of humanity to intervene, to take control and to create the balance that is needed for the whole arrangement to work. In co-operation with scientist Duncan Coston the artists have re-designed and made a Buzzing Machine, a mechanical box that moves 'dancing bees' and is computer linked to recorded mechanical 'buzzing' sounds, in order to carry on Klee's work of drawing attention to the fragile balance between nature and our industrialized environment. This work is particularly concerned with the conservation of our bee population, raising awareness and educating people about the importance of bee cross-pollination in relation to our foodstuffs. Exhibited at the NBGW 2017 Dr Beynon's Bug Farm 2017/18 and in July 2018 The Heart of Wales Line (Arriva Trains).","Artwork","2017","This artwork was one of sixteen developed for the Cross-pollination exhibition which to date has been held at the National Botanic Garden of Wales (throughout all parts of the Garden) and at Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, Pembrokeshire, where it currently is still on show. Plans are in place to exhibit as part of the Bath and Bristol Festival of Nature, June 2018, and Cornell University, USA in 2020. In 2017 the number of visitors to the exhibitions totaled 29,804. There were 8 days of workshop sessions with schools, families and young people with learning difficulties, a total of 414 participants. Other activities around the exhibition included 5 art crits where the work and exhibition was discussed between participants (scientists, economist, and artists) including a linguist who was researching art/science communication through this project. Notable impacts include A) One of the main aims of the project was to demonstrate to scientists that art research can contribute to scientific research and that collaboration with artists would be a valid practice. There has been a complete seed change, from what was initial scepticism from many of the scientists, to complete involvement and appreciation of the benefits of such collaboration. In impact terms this could be measured by the inclusion of artists in new projects and future proposals for funding. Of the six science teams involved in the project, two teams have applied for and received funding which now included artist/ art researcher participation and the remaining teams have planned collaborations with artists, some who were participants in the project. In addition the organisations involved i.e. The Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Buglife, Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, the Heart of Wales Line. Arriva Trains, and the National Botanic Garden of Wales are all continuing to collaborate with the project after funding. B) The exhibitions, conference and public/schools workshops have informed the public about the pollinator crisis and material evidence has been collated to demonstrate that there have been behavioural changes as a response to greater knowledge of pollinators and the problems facing them.C) This artwork is one of two intended for exhibition along the Heart of Wales Line as a performance piece. The Chair of Heart of Wales Railway Development Group was invited to the Introductory Networking Event as this group was planning bee friendly gardens at each of the 27 stations on the line. At this event a suggestion was made by one of the attending artists for each station on the Heart of Wales Line ( Arriva Trains) to 'adopt' a species of bee. Following discussions of the concept an executive decision was taken to give the Heart of Wales garden project the title the Bee Line, with stations along the route being branded for different bee species, and bee gardens at each station being developed with assistance of scientists involved in the project, from the National Botanic Garden of Wales and the Bumblebee Conservation Trust. Although not passing through populous areas, this line is primarily a tourist line and the renaming and branding will enhance the public's awareness of the plight of the bee, as well as other pollinators, particularly as it is celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2018 . The collaboration from the scientists with the volunteers developing the gardens will ensure greater success with this initiative.","https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com","5aa17023ddb637.31845755","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5aa17023ddb637.31845755&grantRef=AH%2FN00597X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/N00597X/1","AF5C5F5A-F5F0-411B-878D-6360246B1BE2","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","7D8346F1-4332-4E10-A513-F2A5B463A923","059EC835-FD25-406D-A849-5BD0D33B0DE7"

The Model consists of a main body representing &frac34; of the building, a separate quarter which can be slotted in, and a detachable roof construction.
The detachable quarter is a scaled down 'replica' (1:125) of the fragment of an original working model (1/4''=1'-0; ca 1:48) used in the 1860s to develop the Royal Albert Hall's design, which survives in the Royal Albert Hall's archive. The remaining portions of the building have been reconstructed using clues contained in the available fragments, archival documents and historical drawings. The aim was to construct a model as similar as possible to what the original model would have looked like.
The minutes of meetings of the advisory committee reveal how a wooden model was used as a starting point for discussions around the design of the building. Members would regularly meet with the RE Henry D. Scott, who was in charge of the project, in front of the model and suggest alterations to the design. Following these meetings, the model would be modified through an iterative process.
It is a very rare occurrence that such a working model exists and it is even rarer that such rich archival documentation survives, giving a sense of how it was used. 
The exterior is very plain, showing only a limited portion of the fa&ccedil;ade, as a 'stick on' two-dimensional coloured drawing. The model was built, in fact, to develop the design of the building's interior. Separate models (some of which are in the V&amp;A collections) were made to work out the architectural features of the exterior. 
Judging from the material evidence, it is likely that the model was constructed in a way which would enable users to inspect the interior closely from different points of view. The roof could be lifted to look at the auditorium as a whole from above. Furthermore one quarter (or maybe a half) could be extracted to allow a closer view from the side. It is also likely that the model did not have the arena's floor. Such a solution, given the considerable size of the object, would have allowed a viewer to stand inside the model shoulder-high and look around, simulating, to a wider extent, the impression of the architecture on a visitor standing in the finished building.
The model being donated is the outcome of a collaboration between Dr. Simona Valeriani (V&amp;A Research Institute) and Mr. Scott Miller (B.15 Workshop, University of Manchester). It is based on the research carried out by Simona Valeriani on the building history of the Royal Albert Hall, funded by the Leverhulme Trust. It was made to coincide with the 'Shaping Space: architectural Models revealed' exhibition at the Building Centre (funded by this grant), where it was on show alongside the original fragment and a digital version of it. 
The artefact has grown out of a sustained conversation between Simona Valeriani and Scott Miller. The process of making the model has brought to light- questions around different possible architectural and technical solutions. Similar considerations, undoubtedly, were at the forefront of the designers' minds in the 1860s.
This collaboration has been crucial to interpreting the original model and understanding its place in the design process, as well as leading to a detailed critical analysis of the drawings kept in the archive. The collaboration and the making of the model have been enabled by generous funding by Manchester University.","Artefact (including digital)","2021","The architectural model of the Royal Albert Hall was prominently displayed in the exhibition Shaping Space - Architectural Models Revealed at the Building Centre. Its production solidified the relationship between the V&amp;A and the University of Manchester, leading to additional funding for the project from the university and the delivery of a series of special workshops for students from the university and prospective sixth-form students. It was a key object used by all primary, secondary and tertiary educational outreach for the exhibition. It has also created a professional model of how historic research and contemporary model-making skills can through an act of re-making produce innovative research into historic building practices and our built environment today.","https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/news/display/?id=27101","62330e84773125.99203530","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=62330e84773125.99203530&grantRef=AH%2FT006374%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/T006374/1","8FEFC161-2091-4F5D-857D-8B211BBDC629","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","BC28FD28-76CD-4589-80ED-6763825FB3CC","04D1373D-E300-4953-A296-CF866EB61F8A"

At the Rambagh Gate, part of Amritsar's pre-Colonial wall being restored by CRCI, this included working against existing practice in Amritsar to destroy or remove encroachments on historical sites in order to include the communities and groups who have repurposed historic sites for everyday use (the encroachments at the Gate include a food market, a school and a colonial-era printing press). Resulting action also included using traditional skills in sign-painting to improve the aesthetic appearance of the market (involving over 50 stalls and several hundred stall workers) and designing information sessions on the Rambagh Gate's history for school-children (involving over 100 children). This is the first time the Gate has been accessible as a public space.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2019","In both contexts described above, the majority of participants reported that this was the first time they realised the Gate had historical significance. This insight during the process, led the team to approach the Municipal Government of Amritsar with plans to create a 'pop up' People's Museum that could bring together heritage narratives connected to the Sikh Empire, Partition and the local forms of creative and cultural resilience as evidenced in the school, the market and the printing press. We changed the perception of the market from an encroachment to a valid part of the Gate's history as evidenced by Amritsar city granting permission for our initiatives and its subsequent plans to make the Gate a permanent community space. This is the first time the Gate has been accessible as a public space. 
The Sikh Foundation called the museum, 'a participatory space narrating people's stories and creating a revitalized perception of Amritsar' . This new museum space has attracted thousands of interactions on social media (Facebook and Instagram), national press coverage in India, and hundreds of visitors who have positively reported on the accessibility and value of learning about neglected aspects of Amritsar's heritage.

The Nova Zembla prints, having lain frozen in the Arctic for three centuries, provided Bowen with opportunities to explore the materiality of drawing and the ephemeral nature of museum objects on paper. The project is contextualised by drawing research and practice that explore themes of ephemerality. In Paper: Pressed, Stained, Slashed, Folded (MOMA, New York, 2009), these are addressed through employment of fugitive materials as in Beuys (Painting Version, 1976), Cage (Wild Edible Drawing, 1990) and Long (Mississippi Mud Drawing, 1992). Greenhill's, The Fugitive Materials, Tate Modern, investigates artworks in transient materials whilst Pott's discusses the dilemma of conserving works &quot;whose ephemerality is integral&quot; (Tate Paper, 2007).
 
Ongoing interest in drawing &quot;as an explanatory and exploratory tool&quot; (Lines of Enquiry, Kettle's Yard, 2006) and in the capacity of the textual nature of museum objects to communicate, opened a clear position for research that investigates relationships between these strands.

The installation prototyped an augmented reality experience aimed at taking visitors at the Horniman Museum into the everyday first-millennium life of a Kuikuro indigenous village in Brazil, allowing them to explore Kuikuro myths and legends, and enable them to experience the powerful, live immersive performance rituals of the Xingu territories. By combining digital content, captured using world-leading cultural conservation practices, with virtual and augmented reality tools, visitors learned about the day to day life, environment and cultural practices of the Kuikuro. The installation, the first of its kind, involved indigenous people directly in a process that both preserved and disseminated their social and cultural histories. Through use of non-contact technologies (ipads, hololens headsets, holograms, video mapping, 3D replica), the installation has raised awareness of remote and fragile indigenous communities, whose way of life is beyond the reach of the general public, without putting them at risk.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2018","What was clear, from all the conversations, was the' Xingu Village experience' had clearly impacted positively on its audience and left most of them wanting more of this kind of intervention from museums and galleries. 
Those who did participate in the complete experience spoke of it as being 'a unique concept and opportunity' and something they had never done before or certainly not encountered in a museum or gallery previously. 
Most visitors had valued the way the augmented reality technology brought objects to life in a new and engaging way, even when it wasn't perfect. 
Parents with children were pleased it could 'be enjoyed on so many levels' and most felt they were going away knowing more but also wanting to learn more because of the unique and multi-layered nature of the experience. 
People spoke about the ways in which the experience not only enabled them to understand a different culture but to also, 'to see outside ourselves, to see where we belong in the bigger picture.' 
There was a general consensus that 'much more of this kind of thing should happen'. And that it should be a two-way process. Many felt there was much for us to learn from the Kuikuro people. Especially about the ways in which they had preserved strong links with their cultural identity and their roots, while still being clearly part of the modern world and its technology.","https://www.horniman.ac.uk/visit/events/xingu-village","5c75a929534ca5.92691984","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5c75a929534ca5.92691984&grantRef=AH%2FR010366%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/R010366/1","0C97430E-34EC-40B7-BCE8-B31B6B2A54F9","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","EB20A142-FD1C-4BF8-BE79-6ACA267E84E6"

The videos were designed for a range of audiences and intended to be used as a short introduction to inequalities on a range of topics.

This video focuses on changes within urban areas in terms of population growth, regeneration and employment patterns. It argues that inner city regeneration has forced low income families into suburbs, which makes access to work and amenities more expensive, although it does reduce exposure to air pollution. These changes are not true of all urban areas - smaller areas are seeing poverty being imported back to city centres, along with increased pollution, as wealthy families move out (especially with the impact of Covid-19). Different policies are needed depending on where poverty is situated, with both local and regional strategies that connect poorer families to jobs, facilities and skills.","Film/Video/Animation","2021","This video has been shared widely with policy makers and practitioners and we are currently monitoring impact.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BGcokOAqbY","622a16f4e63e32.67899390","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=622a16f4e63e32.67899390&grantRef=ES%2FP009301%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/P009301/1","9CB53A86-7CF9-4CD3-A3F9-2D9711A5407B","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","B4D62DBF-F9E5-485C-BC3A-4933D137E921"

From the late-eighteenth century, basketry was taught in blind workshops and sanitoria, and during the First World War it was used to aid the rehabilitation of shell-shocked soldiers. It went on to become a flagship craft for occupational therapy in the mid-twentieth century. This film follows the rise and fall of basketry as a therapeutic and rehabilitative activity, exploring how and why it fell from favour, and considering the renewed interest today in basketry as a therapeutic tool in its widest sense and the role it can play in wellbeing.","Film/Video/Animation","2017","This film provides a historical overview of basketmaking for therapeutic purposes, which again is becoming very relevant, as there is a renewed and growing interest in basketry as a therapeutic tool in its widest sense and the role it can play in wellbeing.

The brief was to create a temporary structure and pavilion that would showcase the Hatton gallery around Newcastle and Gateshead while the gallery was closed for refurbishment.

For my collaborative proposal with architect Jack Mutton, we proposed to create a pavillion that would showcase facsimiles of the Hatton Gallery collection, displayed on a curved steel mesh frame. Inspired by the inspirational, innovative exhibition histories of the Hatton Gallery, for example, Richard Hamilton's (1955) exhibition, Man Machine and Motion and his collaborative exhibition with Victor Pasmore and critic Lawrence Alloway, An Exhibit (1957). Both these exhibitions took influence and precedent from avant garde exhibition designs in central Europe such as Mostra di Studi sulle Proporzioni IX Triennale di Milani 1951 and pavilions design by Le Corbusier. Much in the same way our proposal and gallery installation took further inspiration from pioneering exhibition design in referencing Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich, Cafe Samt &amp; Seide exhibition in which hanging silk and velvet curtains were used to create intimate areas for display and events to happen. Instead of silk and velvet our proposal took inspiration from materials used within the archive and art conservation.

We wanted to be able to view the collection in a different and unique way from that which you would normally view a work from the collection. Instead of seeing the whole painting or work, we wanted to abstract the painting from the collection by cropping sections from the painting with cut out framed holes within the fabric curtains that would drape in front of the paintings. It was important to us that a variety of works were chosen from the collection as we believed it was vital to showcase the breath of style, technique and period within it.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2016","Through this exhibition I increased my network through meeting people at the exhibition opening. My work was seen by a large audience as it was exhibited in one of Newcastle's major museum and Galleries. The work was also in dialogue with more established artists than myself. Furthermore the exhibition allowed me space to creatively respond to my research and enabled me to gain more of a form. Through the work it enabled me to be more critically engaged with the Hatton collection and familiarise myself more of how the collection was constructed and what work had been collected during the period I am researching.","https://hattongallery.org.uk/showcase-artists-announcement","5aa8fa687528a9.05168673","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5aa8fa687528a9.05168673&grantRef=1644452","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=1644452","E16373F4-A3F0-48D9-BCB2-780002A30751","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68",

This exhibit will create an interactive discussion of the untapped potential of data to convey both artistic and scientific meaning, including new work exploring Arctic environmental change.
 
Environmental data and computer algorithms contain patterns that can inform both scientific findings and artistic expression. This exhibit will create an interactive discussion with participants about the untapped potential of data to convey artistic meaning. The displayed works are an exploration of the theme of 'Our Connected World' by demonstrating the connections between art, scientific data and environmental change.
 
The exhibit additionally includes new work that is a collaboration between artist Simon Sloan, communicators and scientists at the University of Edinburgh to create visualisations of data collected during field expeditions to the Canadian Arctic (http://teamshrub.wordpress.com/). This new digital art will explore Arctic ecosystems undergoing climate and environmental change - connecting the seeming distant Arctic to our daily lives in Edinburgh.
 
Simon Sloan, a recent graduate from Glasgow School of Art has a passion to combine digital media with the natural environment (http://simonsloan.com/). He has developed skills to create interactive installations and data visualisations, with successful exhibitions held in Edinburgh Maker Faire, Glasgow Degree Show and London New Designers.

It was shot over seven weeks between March and May 2017 at Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire, home to the National Willow Collection. After coppicing in winter, the cut willow stools (stumps) re-sprout to produce multiple shoots. This vigorous regrowth allows biomass to rapidly accumulate. Depending on the willow species used, the stems can be used for basketmaking or as a source of renewable carbon for bioenergy and biofuels. The ability of the stools to regrow from repeated harvests for up to 25 years with minimal input makes them of interest due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions.","Film/Video/Animation","2017","The more notable impacts may still be to come, since willow may be a potential source of renewable carbon for bioenergy and biofuels.

The website was built in collaboration with the digital team at the Architectural Association, one of our core Network Partners, using the funds provided by the AHRC for this purpose. The aim of the website is to showcase the potential of a centralised hub for the dissemination of information about architectural models. The website is organised around six core spheres pertaining to architectural models: 
1. Production
2. History and Research
3. Display
4. Learning/Education
5. Conservation/Storage
6. Documentation
Each of these categories is comprised of an introductory text, written by our Network Partners, who are experts in these various fields, a case study, bibliography for further reading and a collection of useful links to significant collections and websites. Related to these various spheres are modular elements that provide more in-depth information on architectural models. These are:
Models in Focus: These individual entries on significant architectural models from the collections of our Network Partners are written according to the ISAD(G): General International Standard Archival Description - Second edition. The intention is to show the potential of a centralised online database of architectural models presented according to recognised international guidelines, which will be useful for future research and will make architectural models accessible for an interested public. 
Events in Focus: These posts showcase past events and make their full programme available to the public, and also provide space to advertise future events. 
Practitioners in Focus: These entries form a valuable contribution to the oral history of architectural model making. Audio files and transcripts of interviews with model makers and architects who use models in their work are made available to researchers and the general public. The intention of these posts is to showcase the potential of extending this online oral history project to become a more comprehensive resource.","Artefact (including digital)","2019","The page has just been launched to partners and friends and will be launched externally on March 29th when the Architectural Models Network will participate in the V&amp;A's 'Friday late' program.

The beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic made dependency on all such fragile systems more obvious. What are the unseen but essential networks within the urban environment of Exeter, and how can we care for them best? 

GPS Embroidery: Acts of (in)visible repair invites women and girls from three different parts of the city to help us create GPS embroideries around the concept of repair. Through community mapping and &quot;walkshops&quot; they share the small but important ways we can enable biodiversity to thrive.","Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)","2021","The GPS embroidery- act of (in) visible repair project took place in four locations across Exeter in the week of 19th to 24th July 2021. Each workshop was open to women and girls and used the technology of GPS trackers to (in) visibly 'embroider' on the landscape. Three extended 3-hour workshops took place in Northernhay Gardens with a group of Chhaya dancers; Higher Cemetery with a group from Mothers who Make; and St Thomas Pleasure Park with a more open mixed group from the local community. There were three further one-hour workshops which were open to women and girls on Saturday 24th July and took place in Riverside Valley Park. These audio workshops drew upon comments on the environment from participants who had taken part in the extended workshops.

The week of events illustrated the many challenges of outdoor theatre - the extended workshops took place in bright, hot sunshine with participants experiencing some of the highest temperatures of this summer, whilst the weather for the workshops on Saturday was more varied and a complete contrast; ten degrees cooler, drizzly and at best cloudy with sunny intervals. As the additional sub-title of 'acts of (in) visible repair' suggests, the project was a post-pandemic response, providing a creative activity which encouraged participants to reflect on unseen environmental networks. Being participatory and immersive the project also enabled participants to engage physically, cognitively and emotionally. As a result, ten participants out of sixteen interviewed reported improved well-being and/ or personal repair. 

Overall, 23 women took part in either the St Thomas Pleasure Park workshop (10) or the Riverside workshops (13). Feedback was gathered from 16 participants; 10 from St Thomas and 6 from Riverside workshops.

Comments from participants
Immediately following the workshop, participants spoke about not being sure about what to expect and coming with few expectations. This was thought to be an important part of the experience by 'finding an openness to it'. One person also spoke about experiencing a nervousness about the event because they were not able to embroider or sew and wondering if this was going to expose her weaknesses. 
• 'It was a wonderful coming together. There was this wonderful sense of trust and I thought it was facilitated so well. We were held so well and warmly. That enabled us to have such a positive experience. I think it was a lot to do with the facilitation. There was a wonderful serenity to itThought provoking but also very calming. A very deep experience. I came away feeling really nourished and calm but also energised in a really positive way. Really wonderful Life affirming kind of way'.
• 'It gave me a new way of thinking. I loved the way it made me think about how we use each other - connect with each other - how we can change small things and make a difference'.
• 'It was a mindful walkIt was good to be peacefulmade me quieter it was so good to have time to be peaceful'.
• 'I've come to the park every day since lockdown with O (baby) but I am usually walking, rushing not looking. This made me look and appreciate'.
• K, was accompanied by her two-year old daughter: 
'I wish there were more things like this - Doing things which are creative and being able to do it with A (daughter). It is good to have a connection with the wildlife of the park - I hadn't thought of that before. It didn't matter how much knowledge you had it was accepted by the group and X and X explain things well. I loved the way you could visualise everything, our ladybird and give it a character. During the lockdown we really appreciated the nearby - like noticing the birds in our garden. We found 21 different species come into our garden. We are trying to continue to create that experience post-pandemic, but it's hard not to go back to how you were'.
• H, was accompanied by a young baby, 
'It really helped me to connect with my old self. I was a Biologist, a Marine biologist and it reminded me of tracking. It was so different from what I do now. Great. So good to connect - thinking about migration, space - trying to make tracks between us and those who live in the park - Tracking using GPS was really interesting - Thinking about what else leaves tracks. I will continue to connect and think about what we have done today. I feel as if my brain has been switched onstimulated. It was special today - interacting with everyone. Being seen as H rather than others seeing the baby first and being seen as a mother.
Being a scientist there are lots of parallels. I didn't know what to expect. It was an unexpected pleasure. It was more internalised, thought provoking and fed the mind. In the later discussion it made me think about the things we take for granted. I tend to do the same walk each day, around here (the park). Today, was nuanced, it will make me think differently when I walk here again I love living here in Exeter. The pandemic has made us explore where we live. Really thought provoking. So good'.
• P, an older person who ran a community dance workshops: 'It wasn't what I expected. It was hot. I enjoyed thinking like an animal. The GPS, looking at the space and ways we can fill it with drawings was interesting. The best thing was meeting everyone else.'
• S, who was a parent of a young child joined the workshop half-way through the session. S was not part of the Mothers Who Make group and had heard about the workshop from a local Social media group: 'It was really nice and helped you connect with nature'.
• A, a member of Mothers Who Make but did not have her child with her, told me she enjoyed these times for herself when her daughter was at nursery:
'It was wonderful, soothing, meditative. Connecting and Reconnecting with nature. I learnt so many things about wildlife - thinking about how we are all connected. How we connect to different space, how we move in a space, how we walk Meandering. We usually walk from A to B, but this was a different way of walking. It really made me think about how we relate to the world around us - This tends to get lost in the digital world we live in. I loved the activity - to tune into something meaningful. Connect, Observe, Connect'.
• B, a woman with additional mobility needs who came to the park regularly said, 'I really enjoyed it being only women. It's why I came. I knew I would feel safe to express myself without worry. It gave me a very different way of understanding space'.
• J, 'I really enjoyed the kind of walking we did which was very unique, very conscious walking. It almost reminded me of Butoh Dance or something like that slow and consciouswalking with an awareness which was very 3-dimensional. We were walking and aware and thinking of what pattern we might be making on a bigger picture but also aware of all the minute detail around us'. 
Five hours after the session I also received a response from a participant via a text message:
• 'Hi, even though I was late at the event I enjoyed the shade and sitting in a circle briefly with a diverse(ish) group of women talking about space, movement, walking. I thought the short exchanges in pairs were valuable. Lizzie created a thread across the generations in the space. I liked that a lot because often it's difficult to connect/ network between different age groups. If space can connect us, then it's so important for our sense of self, our diversity and also the tapestries we create collectively. I enjoyed the sharing that was guided through different activities. The performance made me feel, think, engage the whole of me. I'm sorry I can't attend on 24th [workshops in Riverside] but I'm certainly delighted I could make it briefly today. Thanks'.

Several factors which added to the success of the workshop for participants which included: children being made welcome so the mothers could bring them to the workshop, the timing of the workshop providing something to do in the middle of the day and the outdoor environment within the local community. She felt the workshop enabled participants to being their own knowledge which was then developed by the artist:
'Lizzie, came with so much knowledge of science, geography and the area. I was surprised and so were others I spoke to about the depth of conversation which was generated in both workshops. You had to stop and pause from normal life. You had to take everything in and focus at a micro-level. Participants said how excited they were by the workshop, particularly having time to look at things in a different way. There's very rarely a time or opportunity where you can do something without a key purpose and enjoy it just for the joy of it. It combined Art, Science, Technology and the Environment and fed the brain. That's what people really enjoyed - they were challenged and had to use their brain - they were made to feel as if life was important beyond being a parent'.

What is clear from the comments received, was the joy from participants of all ages who took part. Several recurring themes emerged, such as: seeing things differently which enabled participants to think, see and appreciate the space in a new way. Many participants spoke of experiencing the park in a utilitarian way during lockdown, particularly with young children as part of a daily pandemic routine. For many, the workshop improved their well-being due to the peaceful and calming experience created by the facilitators. There was also an enjoyment and re-invigoration which came from developing new knowledge and re-connecting with the Arts, Science and Technology at a deeper level. 

Audio workshops - Riverside Valley Park

Three one-hour audio workshops took place within the Riverside Valley Park on Saturday 24th July involving between three to six participants each workshop. Like the extended workshops, these focussed on the interconnectedness between us and the natural environment and used GPS trackers to etch, repair and 'embroider'. Unlike the extended workshops participants eaves-dropped on snippets of conversation recorded at the previous workshops and followed audio instructions pre-recorded by Lizzie. The impact of this medium of delivery meant participants concentrated on the steps and movements to create an embroidery image, as one participant explained; 'You had to follow instructions, but this immersed you into the performance. Drawing patterns on the ground' (R). Observing the activity, for much of the first half of the workshop, participants tended to look down on the ground where they were walking: 'I enjoyed drawing with my feet. It made me deliberately look at the earth beneath me, seeing shapes. It was interesting seeing people visualise or drawing round a tree. I wouldn't usually feel comfortable doing an activity like this, but I felt reassured. It helped me reconnect to Riverside'(R).

This sense of re-connection or seeing Riverside differently was regularly mentioned by participants from the workshop and was similar to previous feedback at the extended workshops. Some participants spoke about walking through Riverside Park as a regular exercise activity during lockdown, but as lockdown restrictions had been lifted they had visited less often. Other regular visitors also appreciated the opportunity to see a familiar space from a different perspective.

The workshop had a performative element, as identified by R, above. Passer-byes, passing through the park often stopped to watch, either from the pathway which cut through the two groups of embroiderers, or from an elevated position on a nearby bridge. To an observer the movements were of a computer game, non-humans following a leader in synchronised format or a ritualistic ceremony with moments of stillness and silence. As the workshop progressed, there was increased interaction with the environment and more individual and expressive movements, such as a young girl playing with grasshoppers in the meadow, or concentrated individual 'stitching'.

Many of the participants were from the University; some came to the workshop knowing Lizzie's work in general but not having experienced it first-hand. At the end of the performance many participants commented on the emotional connection and impact of the activity:

• I've known about Lizzie's work for a long time but never had the opportunity to participate. It was really lovely. I found it really calmingthe voice was really calming. I don't always like audio tours but this one I found quite emotional - particularly when they were talking about repair. It made me reflect on my personal life (B).
• I've known about Lizzie's work. I found about the workshop today through a University post. I was worried I may need to know about stitching. It made me look at the space. We know the park, but this time was different - walking in a different way - a solitary walk due to social distancing. This experience made me look at things in a different way. Look at the environment in a different way. I thought it was an interesting pace - Mindfulness Slow. I usually walk much faster than the audio. I felt a strong sense of connection with the space - It was a canvas we were marking (I).

Two other participants had no connection or knowledge of Lizzie's work, one having seen the event on a local Facebook page and the other heard about the event from a friend. For this person, she was attracted because it was a woman only event. She said she felt safer in this female environment, although she did feel the workshop being described as embroidery was rather stereo-typical. Both women enjoyed the event due to its meditative quality, needing to focus on little things and the world beneath your feet - 'I saw a grasshopper and damsel fly. I found myself noticing the insects more because I was looking more'(An). The care the company had taken in compiling the audio and considering the technical aspects was also important but they both offered suggestions for future events:
• 'I liked the interweaving of voices, hearing snippets of people's conversation. It made you stop and look. I thought all of the technical side - getting the email with an audio file worked fine. I would have liked a few more pauses so you could stop a bit longer to observe the environment and not only listen - that would have made it a more visual experience but then you would lose being able to listen to people talking. The earphones tended to exclude all other sensory elements' (Al).
• 'I liked the voices, but I found them a bit quiet which could have been due to my headphones The event could have excluded people who don't have Smart phones as it didn't say in the instructions that you needed one' (An).

When asked to reflect and summarise the experience in brief statements, participants from across the three workshops spoke of:
• 'Re-connecting to physical space and area, reconnecting to the environment; Thinking outside the box; Time and Space'.
• 'Calm. Sewing - yes, I feel like have been sewing. Repair definitely - drilling down beneath the surface. Lovely connection with people. Exploring together.
• 'Peaceful. A group meditation on walking, space and repair'.
• 'During the pandemic I have been used to being outdoors as a family. This involved walking in a larger group, but it was with people I know so it was different but very safe'.
• 'I felt it was a bonus knowing each other. I enjoyed being outdoors. I was more aware of the distance between us. I felt more comfortable because we were outside. It felt as if we were alone in the field'.

As this project provided an artistic response post-pandemic, the comments, above, illustrate how the 'walk-shop' contributed to the participants growing confidence of mixing with others outdoors in a safe, socially distanced way and instilled a sense of healing and repair.

Longitudinal impact of the project

a) Lizzy's story - working on the project
'It was fantastic, engaging, interesting Lizzie has a wonderful way of working with people. I found her inspiring. Being involved in the project has given me such confidence' (LH).

It was clear from my discussion with Lizzy that the workshops and being involved as a producer for the extended events, had had a profound impact on her, giving her the confidence to be able to produce future events and take on new challenges. This was evident from the passion Lizzy showed when she entered the exhibition a month after the original workshops and described an event she had facilitated that afternoon for Mothers who Grieve. She attributed much of this positive change in her to the compassionate and sensitive way she had been treated by Lizzie. Lizzy had found it difficult to re-establish herself following the birth of her baby during the pandemic and saw the GPS Embroidery project as a small act of personal repair. She reported feeling more resilient and emotionally prepared to take on new challenges:
'Lizzie was very encouraging throughout. I was very worried when the group, Resilient Women, cancelled due to staffing problems - I tried to source and recruit more participants to create another group but that was so difficult in the timescale. Lizzie was brilliant and so reassuring' (LH).

As this was the first time Lizzy had taken on the role of producer, she felt Lizzie had provided an excellent role model and mentor during this time,
'I felt empowered by Lizzie throughout the project and that has had a profound impact on me, it's given me the self-confidence to consider more producing and run other workshops' (LH).

Lizzy also felt she had learnt a considerable amount during the project and offered the following 'food for thought' comments on how the project may have been organised differently when considering timing of the event and sourcing participants. One of the issues she found was having to recruit participants with a very short lead in time. Some of the groups Lizzy approached were existing groups such as the Chhaya Dance group,
I had to be very careful who I recruited because some groups had people who were being paid to run a session and participants were expecting their tutor to run the session not Lizzy. Lizzy coped with this really well with the dancing group from Northern Hay, but it wouldn't have worked with say the Belly-Dancing group - There was the issue of paying the person who was running the session or the participants not paying for a session. I would have said more to the tutors if I had had more time. It's difficult to build relationships and the issue of paying being there in the background. Maybe there needs to be more put in the budget for a longer lead-in time and longer time for producing (LH). 

b) Amy's story - longitudinal impact

Six weeks after the workshop, I arranged to meet with one of the participants, Amy, in the park where the workshop had taken place to discuss how attending the workshop had continued to have an impact on her. From the beginning of our meeting, it was clear she wanted to share the continuing effect of the workshop, 'I had no idea what a profound experience it was going to be'(AA). Amy explained how since the workshop she had noticed feeling more in-tune with the environment; she was able to feel 'in the moment' when she was in other public outdoor spaces and parks and this had had an impact on her well-being:
It was very noticeable shortly after the workshop. We were in London and went to some gardens the Chelsea Physic Garden and that was a very different experience from how I would usually experience a garden. I was really aware of the height and all the detail, and touch and smell - a very different experience that I usually have. I was tuned into this experience that's what I am trying to explain, of being 'in the moment' very quickly, tuning into sounds around me, a sensuous experience - sights, smells and picking up my surrounding and connecting with my surrounding and really being grounded in the moment. I also felt a sense of three-dimension within the space. I think often we can walk through a space and we are so used to screens and everything, and photos and everything being a flat vista I noticed shortly after in green spaces that I was looking up and along and down and being very aware of the added dimensions of the space and connecting with the space; connecting with that moment in time and being just really aware of all the creatures, all the leaves, whatever else was around me. So, it's made me have lots of different kinds of connections really and I also noticed connection with me and my childhood because I spent a lot of time outdoors as a child. I grew up without television in the countryside in Austria, and my parents would just say &quot;Well go outdoors, spend your time outdoors&quot;. They encouraged me to be outdoors. I used to spend hours and hours just being outdoors on my bike, walking. And this experience has taken me back to that time as well. Lots of differed connections have followed this workshop - Connections with other people; other beings; other times, and then an immediate connection with the space. Something I often don't experience when I am walking through these beautiful spaces, because I usually have all sorts of other things on my mind. (AA). 

Amy also spoke of a change in attitude when she visited other green spaces, particularly when visiting the park with her two-year-old son. She felt the workshop had helped re-connect with a childlike sense of curiosity in her:
It was a very nourishing... for the soul and very humbling in some ways because when you feel connected to all of the beings and surroundings it does make you reiterate that you are just one part of this great big worldWhen I go to other green spaces it's still having an impact on me, but walking into here today, took me right back to that experience. I went to look at the bark on that tree and wondering what sort of tree it was I think it [the workshop] made my senses more heightened. It's just again that sense of being in the moment which is so important 
I brought my son here I'd brought him here before but there was something different about bringing him here having done the workshop. We went to the splash park over there [points to an area of the park] and again I just felt that grounded, being in the moment, enjoying him - Switching off the chatter in my head and just being with him here in the moment. I think I need to do this more often with himThe workshop really connected me to the space and whenever I come back, it may fade, but it will always be there. I think this space [St Thomas Pleasure Park] is rather special.'

Whilst appreciate that the longitudinal impact is not intensive, relying on only two people's account, what is clear from both Lizzy and Amy's recollection is the long-lasting impact of the project. From the feedback I received from other participants from the extended workshop, I would expect many others would remember the workshop well especially when they re-visited the spaces where it took place.

Conclusions

One recurring theme which emerged from participants feedback suggested the GPS Embroidery workshop provided a positive cultural response which encouraged participants to reflect on environmental and personal repair. Many women related the park where the workshop took place to their own experiences during lockdown, seeing it as a place for daily exercise or an escape from home. In St Thomas Pleasure Park, one person described how the regularity of visiting the park became routine, and how the workshop enabled her opinion to change:

'I've fallen in love with the space again. Due to the lockdown, I was walking through the park regularly, but I felt as if I was walking the same path each day. Now I see things differently'.

Another participant, went further and connected the activities, how meeting and working with others, had re-awaken her and became an act of personal repair:

Coming out the pandemic, well not coming out of, but being in the pandemic - having experienced these strange 18 months, it felt really, really good to meet people again. The conversations we had, the time we had for each other, eye-contact, talking about what's around us, just that connection. The whole day, the whole experience felt a lot about connection to me and the repair, we talked about the visible and invisible repair, and there is obviously the repair of the landscape, which was on our minds, but I also felt there was a repair in (emphasised) US and our connections to each other'.

'It was really joyful and a joyous experience Really wonderful, and I felt, for some time after, I felt very nourished, as if I was beaming. I felt replenished' (AA).

Within Riverside, participants also spoke about the familiarity of re-visiting an area they associated with lockdown and seeing it in a different way, a more positive experience. Some also spoke about enjoying visiting the space again and how this had become more difficult as life became busier as restrictions were released. Four people spoke of feeling safer participating in a workshop with others outdoors, appreciated the social distancing considerations and seeing the activity as a first step to meeting others: 'This involved walking in a larger group. Our first time in a long time, but it was with people I know so it was different, but very safe'. 

Having the opportunity to participate in a women only activity was also mentioned positively by some participants. Lizzy Humber felt this was important in the two workshops she produced,

'The fact the workshop was women only was really good. It was secure; good to be part of something which was exclusive - many participants commented on how that made them feel special and how important it was for them'.

In post-workshop feedback two people, one at Riverside and one at St Thomas commented that they would not have attended had the workshop had it not been female only as they would not have felt as safe. Others participants from both workshops only commented when the composition of the group being women only was raised by someone else, often not realising there were no men, 'I don't think I would have felt so confident using the GPS trackers if there were men around. They would have wanted to take over'. In the final workshop, one participant brought their male partner to the workshop, having not realised it was a women only activity. Lizzie and Anna handled the situation sensitively, ensuring there was no embarrassment, but allowing one audio device between the group meant he naturally explored the meadow on his own and second-hand, away the others.

The input of a local producer enabled the extended workshops to engage women who were new to the GPS Project. Participants on these workshops were more diverse in age and background, including many participants who were young people who attended a dance workshop. Mothers Who Make from around the county and other participants who had been attracted by a Facebook posting in St Thomas also enabled a mixture of participants. Some people knew each other but most did not, however, throughout the workshop there was a shared openness to participate. The opportunity to share and discuss in the extended workshops led to a very different experience from those participating in the Saturday workshops which were more solitary in nature. 

A longitudinal aspect provides interesting feedback on the impact of the work. This would suggest the effect of the workshop has the potential to be long-lasting. At the time, participants from the extended workshops spoke of a deep connection with the activity and the space, of enjoying having to think more deeply and feeling empowered to think of themselves beyond their current role as mother. The comments from those interviewed four-six weeks after the event suggests increased confidence, emotional engagement and memory of the activity will be enduring.","https://www.gps-embroidery.com/","6221d85f58abf3.86920997","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6221d85f58abf3.86920997&grantRef=AH%2FV015230%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/V015230/1","2718969F-D054-4F10-9F2F-83D87CE44886","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","EA7A55EA-489A-4183-B587-58BE97924BAE"

"AHRC","AH/P005365/1","Research Grant","Artistic and Creative Products","King's College London","War Studies","Kerr","Rachel","","Luke Watson and participants: Witness Objects","Pinhole Photography at The History Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina: workshop and artistic production

An appropriation of objects which have played some role in conflicts ranging from WWI to the Siege of Sarajevo - part of the extensive collection at the Historijski Muzej Bosne i Hercegovine (History Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina).

The objects were witnesses to a timeframe of events associated with war, designed to perform, protect or survive violent acts. They are symbol, artefact, evidence and memory in physical form. Their temporary modification into pinhole cameras has given them an unexpected new function, transitioning them from passive object into an active tool. The object has the ability to record, survey and witness. Scenes depicted have tentative yet symbolic connections to the object/camera. The work references the repetitive and cyclical nature of conflict, the blurring of fact and fiction and the untold stories that go undocumented.

In the case of the old Yugoslavian military helmet, the aperture for the pinhole has been located at the point of a bullet hole. Nothing is known about the circumstances of the puncture, although it is likely that the wearer was killed by the wound. The Helmet becomes part of the mythology of the unknown soldier, representing those that were lost in battle but whose bodies were never found. The helmet becomes a symbol of the death of Yugoslavia - the pinhole plate resembling a crude plaster. To the right, the camera's first image - photons replace the trajectory of a bullet reflecting off one of the many towers occupied by snipers during the siege of Sarajevo. The images contain fact and fallacy: a bullet has punctured a helmet - a tower depicted was an infamous sniping position, yet the timelines and the contexts are muddled and lost to us. Their story denotes the universal and repetitive nature of conflict.

The USA Vegetable Oil can has served three functions. It is an object associated with survival, oil to cook food with, a watering can to sustain vegetation, then a camera. The first image 'observed' allowed the object to 'meet its maker' - the highly sensitive US embassy building which resides opposite the museum. We are reminded by abundant signage that to take a photograph of the embassy is forbidden - photography is dangerous, loaded with its own aggressive actions, to load, to aim, to shoot, to capture. This image is no threat but a small act of disobedience.

The infamous Icar tin can, its canned beef contents (or whatever it was), renowned for being 'unfit for human consumption' has also become an observer of things. It references itself, the sarcastic art monument, also a stone's throw from the History Museum. It again symbolises survival but also highlights the anger and frustration felt by many during the siege of Sarajevo, and the feeling of abandonment by the international community.

The humble stove or furnace is a symbol of creativity and innovation in the face of adversity. Adapted from scraps of metal, saucepans and pots, the furnaces were central to survival in the besieged city. It is probably the most famous example of many of the improvised DIY technologies developed through survival instinct. Yet as Guardian writer Justin McGuirk accurately attests in his considered article of 2011, 'it is the design culture of an aberration, a temporary phenomenon within a historical blip.' For the vast majority of its existence, Sarajevo has been a particularly potent centre of tolerance and diversity.

These temporary camera/exhibits are to be used with reverence by participants to make images of their choosing. It is hoped that in doing so, they might perhaps consider more carefully, what might be photographed, given the strange new realisation that the camera itself is a participant and a witness to events both known and lost forever. What do you think it has seen?

This work is the result of a series of explorations, participatory workshops with students from the Technical high school of graphic technologies, design and multimedia, Sarajevo, and has been partly supported in part by the Arts and Reconciliation: Conflict, Culture and Community Research Group (artreconciliation.org) Funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council and led by King's College London and partners at the University of the Arts London and London School of Economics and Political Science.","Image","2019","to come","https://www.lukewatsonphotography.com/de","5e53974280eaa5.26171158","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5e53974280eaa5.26171158&grantRef=AH%2FP005365%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P005365/1","67099655-14BB-41FE-A9C0-E5273830A4AC","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","318B5D98-4CB4-4B10-A876-08FC93071A56","DE48EB48-E91C-4857-B316-0CD41F722A1B"

The video is realised with close ups, graphic visualisations and experimental storytelling.

The concept of the video starts a collaboration on the interactions of soils and airs (exploring what materiality belongs to what medium). 

Soil and air are in constant interaction. Grounds are terrains for soil-air mixtures, where everything is in transit and transformation, where biological, geological and gaseous matter mixes in energy exchange processes, generating growth and enabling decay. Thinking from grounds we explore air-soil relations and seek to challenge ground's status as a dividing surface. 
 
Fluffy Grounds focuses on poplar &quot;fluff&quot;, cotton-like seeds forming biological snowstorms and converting the ground into a soft downy tapestry. Fluff involves and mixes air and soil matter and particles. It is female trees that create the 'spring snow'. They release millions of seeds that are cotton-covered to enhance transport and improve their chances of reproduction and survival. While causing aesthetic awe, this female excess has also become penalized as unwanted and excessive pollution, inducing sterilization, the injection of inhibitors, the creation of genetically modified new breeds or the correction of the gender &quot;imbalance&quot; through sex reassignment surgery - the same treatments imposed on female, queer, racialized or disabled bodies. Yet fluff's ambivalent status contests clear notions of pollution and toxicity in urban natures and demonstrates how queer ecologies are drivers of technological, urban and ecological transformations. 
 
Fluffy grounds, in sum, as a space for critically rethinking urban ecologies.","Film/Video/Animation","2021","The video was shown in the 2021 Beijing Biennale, and following its success in the exhibition (featuring in one of the main exhibition rooms) it has been now included as part of the permanent collection.

"AHRC","AH/J005797/1","Fellowship","Artistic and Creative Products","University for the Creative Arts","Canterbury College","Chell","Edward","http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8955-950X","Bloom","Bloom was a solo exhibition project where the core interests and ideas grew out of but had direct links to ideas being developed in the AHRC supported exhibitions 'Soft Estate' and 'Eclipse' and furthered an exploration of historical links between 18th and early 19th century aesthetics and taste and todays commodity fetishism and cultures of display.

The exhibition was informed by the Horniman Museum and Gardens' taxonomy collection and their plants, both living and preserved but also by their recent re-discovery of four Anna Akins folios of cyanotypes in their library collection and the following helps describe some of the exhibition's rationale:-

Edward Chell's fascination with collecting and classification led him to the Horniman's rare folios of cyanotypes by Anna Atkins, the 19th C botanist and pioneering photographer. In Bloom, an installation of forty new painted panels, Chell responded to Atkins' work by portraying both live plants from the Horniman Gardens and pressed specimens from the museum's herbarium.

Chell's exhibit spotlights diverse narratives surrounding natural history and ecology, bringing into question the values and emotions that emerge when we make images of plants.

Atkins was a scientist and while the 'sun prints' she produced are exquisite, her objective was to document and understand natural genera. Through this process Atkins created repeat motifs and patterns that resonate with the decorative arts of her time, such as Willow Pattern china, floral wallpapers and Wedgwood's blue and white Jasperware.

Chell explores the tension between the scientific drive to define, understand and control, and the aesthetic impulse to capture the unruly gorgeousness of natural life.

Silhouettes bring associations of memorialisation and loss. While Atkins' recorded newly discovered species, today such images are premised on conservation and the threat of extinction.

An accompanying display which Chell, drawing on the museum's collections, conceived as a Cabinet of Curiosities, echoes these themes. Carboniferous fossils, 18th C ceramic plates imported from China and one of Atkins' rare folio volumes are displayed alongside Chell's ornamental pairs of car silencers, etched with roadside plants.

An accompanying colour illustrated publication Bloom further unpacks these themes and ideas, with essays by Anna Ricciardi, Edward Chell and Hugh Warwick, published by Horniman Museum and Gardens in November 2015.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2015","Apart from the large visitor numbers and related Museum events connected to the solo exhibition opening on July 9th and open to a large and varied public seven days a week from 10 July - 6 December, the exhibition and book attracted some good and positive coverage.

Due to advanced computer hardware and high-end graphics cards, trends in virtual reality applications are motivated towards the use of immersive technology for real-time interaction with high detail. Virtual, visual and digital display of lost heritage has inherent values in both the tourism industry and the education process for students in pre-university as well as graduate education. It transfers theoretical courses of archaeology and conservation into real simulations of narratives and historical atmosphere. 

This Exhibition was designed to present a series of interdisciplinary and innovative projects on centred on communicating cultural heritage, (tangible, intangible and built) through engaging digital and virtual heritage experiences. Not only these displays, would produce visual outputs, digital and online applications, but more critically engaging socio-cultural heritage of societies, their histories, narratives and sensory experiences. By 5D, we introduced a demonstration of how different disciplines, researchers and technologies could be employed coherently to showcase how Medieval histories and cultural heritage could be scientifically analyses and validated to verify novel means of engaging public audience and young people in understanding and appreciating technological applications for heritage documentation, recording and preservation. 

This exhibition provided a series of displays of Research-led Innovations and project outputs of recent Virtual Heritage applications, technologies and case studies that took place at the Centre for Architecture, Urbanism and Global Heritage at Nottingham Trent University. This exhibition is curated in collaboration with The University or Leeds and will display projects and output that have been developed in collaboration with Virtual Heritage Cairo Network, the British Geological Survey, Nottingham City Council, Nottingham Castle Trust, National Justice Museum (United Kingdom), Baghdad Mayoralty (Iraq), the National Research Institute for Astronomy and Geophysics (Egypt), amongst others.

Kai-as is mentioned as an important place in peoples' pasts in oral history research with elderly people now living on the edge of a major tourism concession. Kai-as and its strong spring of sweet water feature in peoples' memory as where they would meet when rain season foods became available in this arid landscape. These congregations are remembered as times when people would play their |gais praise songs and arus healing dances. 'Our hearts were happy there', they said. In the decades since, access has been restricted to places important in peoples' pasts as land areas were claimed for mining, commercial farming, conservation and tourism.
Our film &quot;The Music Returns to Kai-as&quot; documents the first 'Kai-as Festival' held from 22-24 May 2019, in which Sesfontein's Hoanib Cultural Group returned to play - once again - their |gais songs and arus healing dances there. It celebrates peoples' resilience in the face of the extreme marginalisation and exclusion effected by processes of colonisation and apartheid.
~ Nb. Polyphonic songs are an important part of this film. We recommend using headphones for the audio to experience the full depth and complexity of this music.
A large part of the second half of the film is an arus healing dance sequence. The songs and practices here are part of a healing tradition that, whilst not static, is generations old. It is a healing technology and understanding of the causes of, and ways of resolving, dis-ease that comes from a time prior to peoples' contact with allopathic medicine and that now exists alongside allopathic medicine. A concern that is often mentioned now is around how the changes happening as modernity takes hold, mean that young people are not being called to become arus healers.~

Alaba, Lagos
February 12&amp;14, 2015
Arriving at Alaba market, plasma screens boast their sizes, the high volume speaker output defies the unruly street noises. Walk against the traffic, snake through the kekes, make yourself invisible, the sky opens up as we reach the end-of-market's e-waste dumpsite.
A landscape fictionalized - cows fed on the e-waste roam the hills, weight scale hung aloft, loads of metal parts carried by heads, old TVs transported by hand trucks, boys, young men, elders, dealers, buyers, sellers engage with each other - unscrewing, hammering, sorting, pounding, weighing, Naira exchange hands. Smoke rises as un-wanted cables and parts are burnt on the not-so-distant hills.
At the workshop space, I work with/for Basiru, 26 year old, who dissects circuit boards for parts that can be recycled and worthy of some Naira.
Aluminum - 170ngn per KG
Copper - 1000ngn per KG 
Blue panel - 800ngn per KG
Resister - 100ngn per KG
(1ngn=Nigerian Naira=0.004euro)
The workers form a circle around the pile of circuit boards. Basiru hammers down the board, retrieves the parts containing copper, I untangle the copper threads. All valuable parts are sorted, each in its own storage pots. Some chitchats are exchanged in native tongues. The sun is high, the pile goes from high to low and high again as more are dumped constantly. The 'un'natural resources seem to be inexhaustible. Make and unmake, the technology chases its own tails. Print and unprint, the broken circuits fail the promises.

Project R-hythm culminated in 1 performance event that hosted a total of 18 people who took part in the performance walk. The audience were aged between 4 - 77yrs of age. 

The project supported the formation of a number of partnerships which house ongoing conversations regarding participatory practices and performance as a collaborative research tool.

The Confuciusornis is a genus of primitive crow-sized birds from the early Cretaceous period dating from 125 to 120 million years ago. 
The original fossil has a very low physical profile within the stone bedrock so is not dramatic in a 3Dimensional sense, however the remains are finely preserved and the study of the chemistry from this particular fossil has led to breakthroughs in the understanding of the colour of fossilised feathers. 
From a visitor point of view the project also helps to illustrate how the preservation and conservation of our artefacts in museums is important and highlights the need to preserve and not contaminate or obscure the evidence that resides in the material of the object. The analytical instrumentation that has enabled the chemical evidence on the Confuciusornis Sanctus to be analysed has only been available in recent a years; who knows what technology will become available in 20 or 30 years' time that can illuminate us further about the life of these fossil &quot;birds&quot;. 
It was important to produce the replica fossil in stone to mimic the original as closely as possible so that the museum visitor's gains a sense of materiality of the fossil, particularly for our visitors who have a visual or sensory impairment. Nearly all copies of such fossils that reside in museums have been cast in plaster and are fairly common place as teaching tools. There is always the risk of damage and removal of original material evidence when a museum object (fossil in this case) is moulded and cast. 3D scanning now makes it possible to record the surface detail in microscopic detail. Very accurate 3D prints can be made in nylon based materials however they feel warm to the touch and significantly different to the stone fossil.
We worked with Stone Circle an experienced company who provide high quality stone masonry for projects internationally. They worked with us to provide the highest resolution machined stone replica within our budget. A limestone was chosen which was similar to the original from 4 samples. They in fact provided two stone replica editions. The finer the resolution and accuracy of the machining the longer the stone needs to remain on the CNC machine and consequently the more expensive the product; because the profile of the Confuciusornis Sanctus fossil is so low and fine there was an assumption that we would want the detail of the fossilised remains to be more prominent on the surface, so a lower resolution and slightly cruder replica was made alongside a second finer and more accurate edition. The slightly cruder edition may be better for those of our visitors who have less sensitivity in their finger as the skeleton of the bird is more accentuated. The finer version is almost indistinguishable to the original in profile. Watercolour paint was added to provide the visual comparison to the original staining that was left by the soft tissue.","Artwork","2016","The Digital touch replica of Confuciusornis Sanctus will be used in a number of ways. Firstly we will be using and evaluating the interactive and its information in our School fossil sessions (Key Stage 2 and A level) and will change the information and functionality of the interactive dependent on feedback and learning ability. Multiple digital narratives will be added to the sensors in the next 6 months. It will also be evaluated by children with a range of Autism spectrum disorder who require the information to be delivered in very particular ways.
A user can choose which level of information that they want to interrogate and this information can be updated and changed as new scientific research becomes available from the researchers involved in the project.",,"58c6efafb4ce88.82647164","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=58c6efafb4ce88.82647164&grantRef=ST%2FM006662%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ST/M006662/1","99129C8C-1FC2-499A-8AF1-CDD9FE3984C8","D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","4BCF803F-D8F2-4B7B-98CD-C4DA723ADE68"

Yorkshire Mills engaged with RCA graduate designers to produce bespoke garments showcasing the possibilities that exist for high quality wool manufacture in the UK. Outputs were shown digitally by FFF member BrandLab in a virtual showroom.
Designer: Danielle Elsener. Elsener has dedicated her life's work to proving zero-waste as a valid and robust design model. For over a decade, she has learned from industry, educational institutions, and self-run initiatives to understand how best to do this. What began as a love for puzzle solving through zero-waste pattern-making, became a way to fix the fashion industry's biggest problem.
Mill: John Foster Ltd. In 1819, the John Foster story of producing the world's finest worsted cloths from luxurious merino wool, mohair, alpaca, cashmere and silk began. At the age of 21 he started to revolutionise the textile industry. In 1835, Mr. Foster erected a mill in Black Dyke, Queensbury, on the site of a family farmstead. This mill became known as 'Black Dyke Mills', and was the foundation upon which John Foster's immense business was built. John Foster cloths have been at the centre of world fashion since they won their first awards at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Today John Foster continues to weave mohair, cashmere and worsted made from the highest quality merino wool, as well as other noble fibres, into luxury fabric for the finest couturiers, fashion houses, designers, tailors and retailers across the globe.

The second phase of production for I Stood Up involved the design and dissemination of a number of garments including T-Shirts in conjunction with workshops and public events. 

This took the form of fieldwork and participatory events that sought to gather data and visualize individual and collective public concerns regarding environmental degradation, carried out in four locations in London (North, South, East, West). Desk-based research informed this process, identifying the key environmental issues affecting London as a basis for further qualitative and quantitative data gathering. A T-shirt displaying slogans was derived from this research after an iterative development of design prototypes including artifact, photography and questionnaire design. The t-shirt was designed to conceptually represent London as a location created significant interest from a range of passers by, participants self-selecting to take part in the process of putting on the t-shirt, and responding to semi-structured questions about environmental concerns and being photographed. 

Participants were able to take part in one or more elements of the process, being free to opt out at any point. Here we sought to create a kind of social form through a fashion object as facilitator, and a pop-up event that encouraged individual and collective expression. It is the intertwined relationship between form and event, each propelling the other towards the creation of a spectacle in the city (Kessler, 2015), that informs urban life. In this case, the t-shirt and discourse through verbal exchange and photography offer a spectacle that demonstrates culture-making as a live social exchange in the city.","Artefact (including digital)","2015","Exhibition of this work took place at a co-design workshop in a committee room in the House of Lords, March 2015, participation in Cultures of Resilience, March 2015, a cross UAL exchange between researchers, tutors and students, and a second year of participation in Being Human, a festival of the Humanities, November 2014 and November 2014.","https://unrulycities.wordpress.com/","56c71e85dc3188.91261160","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=56c71e85dc3188.91261160&grantRef=AH%2FM005623%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/M005623/1","C16AD3CB-4BC4-4138-9038-32639D9298FB","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","BD856F04-3042-4F92-8D66-1B101801FEB8","737EB87F-9A33-4FDA-B78D-03635EECB444"

This approach shortened the lengthy bureaucratic communication among between local communities and policy makers at different levels in Ethiopia. After the completion of the film project the video piece was disseminated to four different groups. 
1. Stakeholders at the Federal and Regional level 
During the final dissemination workshop of SIDERA in Addis Ababa, the film was shown to representatives from federal and regional offices as well as to the representatives of the national media. Most of the leaders and stakeholders present at this forum had low awareness and understanding of Nyangatom people and the area. The stakeholders involved in the event said they would do their best to address the problem they saw in the film. This created an opportunity for us to present the problem visually capturing the attention of policy makers easily. After the reflection from the audience, we have noticed that the bottom-up formal report from Woreda-Zone-Region-Federal has different gaps and lacks the ability to highlight the problems of the local community. We understand that our effort to fill this gap through participatory video has been fruitful. The suggestion made by the head of the regional pastoralist office could also be used as an evidence to support the argument. He explained the issue further as &quot;even though I am the head of pastoral office of the region, I was not able to see the depth and breadth of the problem as it is presented in the film. Much of the community's problem is explained in a clear and easy way. I hope the film plays a big part in explaining the community and the problem that is being confronted by Nyagatom people especially for those who do not know the area. I believe we can see the change soon if all the stakeholders can work to solve the problems shown in the film&quot;. Generally, the opinions and the comments of federal and other stakeholders regarding the film has helped us understand the importance of participatory methods and its role in reaching out the highest audience for possible solutions and further actions. 

2. Stakeholders at the Zonal level 
The workshop was organized at Jinka town; invited stakeholders include researchers from Jinka University, the sugar project, the zonal, and non-governmental organizations. During discussion with the participants, we noticed that most of the zonal organizations have limited knowledge of the issue at hand. They explained that the parts of the film such as the failed irrigation projects, the locust damages and the severity of cattle diseases differ from their previous knowledge and their organization work plans. After watching the film, they came to notice that the report on these and similar community problems is not well-documented and that most of them were unrealistic. Participants from Jinka, Arba Minch and Addis Ababa Universities also pledged to undertake research and community service activities that would help to solve the community problems. Finally, all participants vowed to go to the community members and to take immediate action to address the stated and related problems.
3. Stakeholders at the Woreda level 
The film was shown to the audience at the woreda/district level working in the area of health, agriculture, social and technology transfer. In addition to showing the film, a summary of the reflection by the Federal Zonal stakeholders was presented. The participants explained that they are aware of many of the problems described in the film. They appreciated the initiative taken to provide this such an organized and understandable format. They also admitted that majority of the reports they sent to the Zone was unorganized and that the community members were tired of unbearable promises. Accordingly, they don't have any doubt that this kind of filmmaking will provide the resources that the governing body can offer to solve the problem, as this film can show the depth and seriousness of the problem.

One of the workshop participant and head of Woreda agriculture office elaborated &quot;most zonal and regional leaders get reports from us about the severity of locusts and the animal disease crisis, but they didn't see and feel the problem at this level as it was seen in the film. Most of the leaders at the regional and federal level have not been to this area and are not able to see our problem; they cannot understand how deep the problem is. Thus, this film brought a living reality to their offices. Even if we have reported the problem many times it has not grasped their attention. Some leaders have never been to the site and have been unable to resolve it because they have underestimated the cost of the project, waste of labor and raw materials. But I believe that the film shows the importance of taking immediate action by raising the proper awareness of each party concerned, as it illustrates the problem at the very grass root level.&quot; 
4. Community members 
The community members involved in the study were given a chance to see the film and they expressed their satisfaction with what they saw. This allowed us to identify the role played by the film to fill the information gap between community members and government and non-governmental organizations. 
A community elder after watching the film narrated his reminiscence about the gloom and taxing reality of the situation as follows: &quot;the last flood was at the end of 2004 and the beginning of 2005. We had a flood that covered the entire area - we had three important things: sorghum, tobacco and calabash (amugit) - you cannot see such things at this time. I'm not exaggerating. You would have seen things like this at this time of year if you had been here before. But now it's just a jungle sometimes with the rain, no more cultivation takes place there. Because we used to cultivate and prepare the land for the coming flood. We put seeds on it and got a harvest. You know, I think this is the end of our people, no longer getting the Omo flood. That is what I can tell you about the Omo. The other thing - about seasonal fluctuation and change - we really don't know what is coming next - about rain or drought - as far as my experience goes, we don't receive enough rain at all to give us a good harvest. Look at those goat and sheep at the film there's nothing for them to eat around here, and they are totally dying of starvation. We have informed this fact repeatedly to the government leaders in the district, but they have made no real difference to us. However, we believe that the film will make a difference because the stakeholders at the regional and federal level will get a better understanding about our situation.&quot;","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E4oS34h3tXEmLaY5NHokrf0RbHkd3rAy","5e748a0a59db66.62387309","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5e748a0a59db66.62387309&grantRef=ES%2FR002460%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/R002460/1","30844999-C3A2-4870-A7C4-567FB2EBF73B","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","78676E9F-E3C5-461C-B706-17CB17EAEFF9","2829180D-7F14-486B-9EAE-6F2F03937093"

Based on simulated but realistic data created to capture five distinct but related 
dimensions of variation (psychometric latent factors), surveyed using adaptive testing 
principles (also known as Computer Adaptive or Tailored Testing). The installation 
represents how estimates are converged upon by a process of item selection contingent 
on prior responses, allowing sonification of an exemplar set of five factor scores.
The multidimensional cases are the person estimates converging on final score values, 
and the uncertainties are the conditional standard errors of measurement, typically under 
the control of the researcher, set so as to reduce incrementally until sufficiently small.
This installation was inspired by conversations between Sandra Pauletto, Tim Croudace 
and Mark Fell about multidimensional personality and psychopathology data. The 
installation was commissioned from Mark Fell and premiered at SoniHED conference. 
Item response theory based data, recreated in simulation scale and scope for this piece

The Action Research Team lead (Laura Williams of Carbon Coop) explains: &quot;We posed the company would as a vehicle through which energy partnerships and infrastructure projects could be initiated to radically change the city region's energy system. There would be a municipally-owned electric vehicle charging scheme; renewable generation installations in partnership with community energy groups; a single, fair energy tariff available to all customers; and a 'comfy homes' energy scheme investing in improving leaky, cold houses. ...Inspired by a model used in the municipalisation of Paris' water services company, we believe the first step would be establishing an 'Infrastructure Observatory' where any Greater Manchester citizen could engage with strategic plans, make decisions around future projects and participate in board elections. Otherwise we risk alienating those that actually use energy services.&quot;

This is listed as a creative project because it presents prospectuses from the future, but it is grounded in real current practice from around the world, and based on findings from a literature survey carried out within the ARC project.","Creative Writing","2018","As planned, the prospectus was launched at the 2018 Greater Manchester Green Summit, where a key success was the announcement of the establishment of a municipal energy company. Carbon Coop continue to lobby for a citizens' governance component for this new company, drawing upon the prospectus as a lobbying tool. (See e.g. its reprinting ahead of the 2019 Green Summit.) 

Carbon Coop are also building on these ideas with partners in the EU-funded Horizon 2020 project, mPOWER (which is currently bringing together stakeholders in 40 European cities). A copy of the underlying literature review has been shared with the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam, to inform their ongoing work on climate change.","https://carbon.coop/2018/03/gm-energy-futures-prospectus/","5c7d63d4842db1.78151408","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5c7d63d4842db1.78151408&grantRef=ES%2FN005945%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/N005945/2","2E8492D4-F10D-4D45-A068-5399782B9A1C","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","7F9EE71B-6F87-4761-8EA3-AFECF377EEAF"

He adopts a transect walk approach where he takes the viewer around, showing his house and the different parts of the settlement. It quickly becomes clear what the key challenges are: small spaces, barely passable paths which become dangerous to walk on in the rain, illegal electrical connections which pose fire and electrocution risk, and an overall poor infrastructure and access to services. However, there are also opportunities, such as vegetable gardening and recycling which can provide viable livelihoods.

Roger McNulty has a background in engineering and steelmaking. An engineering apprentice in Motherwell he was surrounded by Iron and steelmaking plants and their waste products. Subsequently working for British Steel in Industrial Relations gave him close quarter experience of iron and steelmaking processes. His art practice almost inevitably focuses on industrial and urban issues, their people, work and borderlands. His work normally involves landscape although in this project he has also used portraits to highlight concentration and strength. Roger studied art at Glasgow School of Art, Havering College and Central Saint Martins School of Art (UAL).

However, over recent years it has become clear that only a fraction of all published research findings are actually reproducible, causing waste and delays in our efforts to bring new drugs to patients. The answer is changing the way we generate and capture data, including experimental metadata. Especially in light of the increasing role of Artificial Intelligence in drug discovery, it is critical to rethink the way we approach data generation as the most important input for AI-driven drug discovery.

Whilst the MOD is currently undertaking a public consultation process on how and where to dismantle and store Britain's old subs the long term problems of storing radioactive waste remain unresolved. The exhibition included new sculptural, film, sound and installation works by David Mabb, Crowe and Rawlinson, Thomson and Craighead and Susan Schuppli. The exhibition situated these new works alongside a poster artwork by Erika Kobayashi exploring the intergenerational effects of radiation between Europe and Japan from the atomic bomb to nuclear accidents; and Kota Takeuchi's recent work on the complexity of monuments and markers along the Fukushima coastline.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2016","The exhibition took place at KARST Gallery in close proximity to the Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth where several of the Navy's decommissioned nuclear powered submarines are laid up, and due to be dismantled. The Base Commander contacted the gallery on the opening night to officially say that he approved of the exhibition.

The exhibition marked the final year of the Submarine Dismantling Project (SDP) Advisory Group who advised the MOD on the process of dismantling British nuclear submarines for over ten years. The exhibition commemorated the legacy of the Advisory Group process, and their commitment to an open and frank discussion about the issues of radioactive waste management between the MOD, expert advisors, NGO's and statutory agencies. The Chair of the SDP Advisory Group particpated in a round table discussion with submariners, artists and a curator from the William Morris Gallery.

William Morris Tudor Rose fabric (1883) was used in the upholstery of British Royal Navy nuclear powered submarines from c.1961 until 1993. Whilst the traditional English design created a homely feel for the submariners, Morris himself was a committed socialist and revolutionary thinker. Working in partnership with artist David Mabb and The Devonport Naval Base, Ele Carpenter arranged to gift samples of fabrics used on dismantled submarines to the William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow, and the William Morris Society for preservation and scholarship. Along with artists Nick Crowe, Ian Rawlinson and Susan Schuppli, Ele Carpenter was able to capture audio and film footage of interviews with submariners about the fabric, which have also been gifted to the museum archives. Further curatorial work is needed to develop a museum display using the original materials.","http://nuclear.artscatalyst.org/","56cc4e5c572602.58867810","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=56cc4e5c572602.58867810&grantRef=AH%2FJ005746%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/J005746/1","B064D78E-260E-4812-B902-23BB7794D3E1","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","A9B1866C-EE3E-4D81-A83C-118745E9433E","C1A179E6-1697-40BA-BE11-643386A65E32"

Chris talks about Change Point Detection across multiple data streams via dimensionality reduction and subspace tracking. There is a growing interest in data stream research and many real world applications such as; environmental monitoring, financial data analysis, sensor networks, computer network security and data centre management. There are three key challenges discussed in this video. One is the massive amounts of data arriving at high rates, the second is the wish to perform near to real-time monitoring so anomalies can be responded to quickly, and the third is the need for adaptive components. Chris talks about the algorithm he developed to perform change point detection in multiple data streams, the need to find a way to filter detected change points further to find those that are genuinely anomalous events, and how future work will address machine learning solutions to this problem.","Film/Video/Animation","2012",,,"r-9372417171.8325619c9d88e8","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=r-9372417171.8325619c9d88e8&grantRef=EP%2FF001096%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/F001096/1","C720B638-5461-4F86-A707-CC22DACF5997","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","6686F3E1-47F8-47D9-8031-81600E1863AA"

These living, grown micro-crusts are highly ordered three-dimensional structures on a microscopic level. As such, they act not only as visual enhancers through lustrous appearance that changes with light and viewers movement, but as a living mediator between building tissue and the environment by capturing CO2. Through microbial colonisation, biomineralization and self-assembly of nanoscale building blocks the project aims to produce such biological micro-crusts in ecologically benign processes. Components exhibited are encrusted in living microbial colonies embedded in silica precipitated matrix and as such have a potential to actively engage in nitrogen, carbon and silica cycles, some of the most important element exchanges on our planet.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2020","Due to global pandemic the exhibition took place physically locally (in Belgrade, Serbia) and digitally locally (through Ars Electronica platform).

It is based around visual and aural experiences centred upon the Lamaload dam in the Peak District. Francois Edwards used project funds to collaborate with Mark Pilkington on an evolution of his artwork. This consisted of devising a list of key words and thought provoking words on the topic of dams and their societal and environmental impacts (good and bad) that were then inserted into the movie, flashing up briefly at random throughout. This version of the film was screened at the Liquidscapes conference in June 2018 , an arts and humanties conference on the topic of water.","Film/Video/Animation","2018","The aim of this screening was to further raise interest in water managment issues and provoke thoughts on the trade offs between society and the environment. The film received good feedback from the diverse audience (social scientists, artists, general public, environmental stakeholders and professionals). While some appreciated the unique visual and aural interpretaion of what a dam is, others responded to the thoughts provoked by the superimposition of key words. The movie was popular with those that had attended the presentation by Francois Edwards on dams in human landscapes at the same conference, who felt that (as was intended) they had experienced the same concepts presented in two ways, a traditional presentation and an artistic interpretation.","https://player.vimeo.com/video/268793527","5b9f961e67eb87.50222402","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5b9f961e67eb87.50222402&grantRef=ES%2FP011373%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/P011373/1","BFF73930-DB95-4A7E-BC3C-8EF49DDBEDA7","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","5D5142C5-2130-4AE0-AB17-FDF8F6E78B21"

In Uganda, Mulungu was one of the shores that was flooded in this time.
The community in Mulungu was a very vibrant space of businesses, homesteads and a lifestyle that had existed on the shores for generations. 
This very live community was pushed away and hundreds of people lost their properties to this &quot;tragic&quot; change as the lake slowly took over this space.

Though the people of Mulungu were severely affected, a few months after the flooding; after the new shore line was created; after some of the residents had rebuilt their lives(on a piece of land close by) and everything was back to business-as-usual, their previous home(or what was left of it) was turned into a wasteland that is heavily polluted with plastic. 

It is clear that no one stopped to question what could have caused this flooding, or what could cause the next (or an uglier event).

A Conversation Between Trees is an international collaboration between the artist collective Active Ingredient, Horizon Research Institute (University of Nottingham), Senior Climate Scientist Carlo Buontempo and British Brazilian artist Silva Leal.

The exhibition involves a live 'performance of data' as part of an installation and an interactive mobile phone experience that audiences can take out into a forest or park close to the exhibition. Sensors attached to mobile phones are placed in a tree in both forest locations. Live environmental and photographic data is collected from the trees, projected on two opposite screens in a gallery space as an abstract visualization.","Artwork","2010","The project involved 4 exhibitions in the UK and 1 exhibition in Brazil, attracting a total audience of 8000 people diversity across all ages and backgrounds.

The exhibition was held at Mann Library and Gallery, Cornell University, USA. It was further funded by mann Library and Wales Arts International. 
Eight artists were involved using a variety of media. Three of the artists set up new collaborations with Cornell University's Professor Scott McArt. These were Professor Andrea Liggins, Sarah Tombs, Annette Marie Townsend and Daniel Trivedy. Professor Catrin Webster produced new work for the exhibition.
1. PolliNation Portraits: Professor Andrea Liggins
Collaborating scientist: Assistant Professor Scott McArt, Cornell University 
Most people when asked to describe a pollinator will think of a honeybee or a bumblebee such as Bombus terrestris (Europe), not realising that there are 25,000 known species of bee in the world (about 4,000 in the USA and 250 in the UK). A quote from the British writer John Fowles suggests, &quot;The greatest threat to our countryside is less the physical harm we do than a growing detachment from that reality&quot;. These portraits attempt to address the separation of people from the diversity and richness of these wonderful and very important creatures. They were collected from around the world, Bolivia, Australia and Argentina for example, and from as far back as the 1800s. 
This work originated with Andrea Liggins working in collaboration with Dr Andrew Lucas, photographing forgotten and overlooked landscapes, the wild, marshy fields of Wales and the forgotten pollinators themselves - Hoverflies. During a four-day visit to Cornell University, Liggins was introduced to the amazing insect collection (CUIC). She spent her visit making these portraits of bees, hoverflies and moths, assisted by a research student Paige Muniz.
Liggins says of the photographs &quot;These are not sharply focused images, that show you what the bees and hoverflies look like in all their scientific detail but are meant to be portraits, that engage you with their 'being'. I don't know whether bees and hoverflies have personalities, but I saw each of them as an individual, full of character. I felt that I came to know each one, as a portrait artist would get to know the sitter and I hope that comes across.&quot;
2.From the Collection: Nests and Eggs :Sarah Tombs
Collaborating scientists: Assistant Professor Scott McArt, Dr Peter Graystock, Cornell University, New York 
Bees wax, Bronze and Glass
In August 2017 Sarah Tombs visited Cornell University to observe Dr Peter Graystock and his team undertaking field research. During the visit Tombs looked at pollinators eggs and nests in the Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC). Some nests and eggs are found hanging from branches, this became the inspiration for her bronze and glass sculptures. 
3.Fragaria vesca, Wild strawberry : Annette Marie Townsend
Collaborating Scientist; Assistant Professor Scott McArt, Cornell University 
Materials - Beeswax, pesticide residues in the beeswax (piperonyl butoxide, fenpyroximate*, metolachlor*, azoxystrobin*, coumaphos, pyraclostrobin*, cyprodinil*, trifloxystrobin*, fluopyram* and atrazine), tinned copper wire, tissue paper, dressmaking beads, cotton thread, silk fabric, dry ground artists' pigments, acrylic paints, acrylic varnish. *These pesticide residues were also found on nearby strawberry flowers.
The concept for this artwork was conceived following a chance conversation between scientist and artist at the Cross-Pollination Conference in 2017. Since that time, scientific data and wax samples have been sent across continents and the concept has grown into a piece of collaborative scientific art. 
The Fragaria vesca, Wild strawberry sculpture, created using traditional wax model making techniques, has been made from honey bee wax provided by Dr. Scott McArt, Assistant Professor at the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the NYS Beekeeper Tech Team. The honeybee wax, collected from bee colonies in New York State, has been analysed and found to contain pesticide residues. As the sculpture contains traces of these agricultural chemicals, they have been listed as artist's materials. 
Wax has been used by artists in the creation of scientific models for education and teaching since the late 17th century, and botanical wax model making reached a height of popularity during the advent of the public museum in the 19th century. The translucency and life-like quality of the material enabled artists to create realistic and beautiful representations of plants for gallery displays, in order to engage visitors with scientific discovery. 
This work continues this tradition, aiming to raise awareness of the widespread use of agricultural chemicals and the transfer of these chemicals from agricultural crops to wildflowers and pollinators, promoting discussion on the man-made issues, which have contributed to the global decline of pollinating insects. 
4. Dissecting the Anthropocene: Daniel Trivedy 
Collaborating Scientist; Dr Peter Graystock, Cornell University, now at Imperial College, London
There has been a noticeable trend towards the use of artificial plants in our everyday environment;the omnipresence of synthetic topiary balls and artificial grass are a common manifestation of this trend. It appears that some members of the public want to be surrounded by the forms of nature but in a way that is clean, sterile and user friendly. The use of non-biodegradable plastics to create these forms is problematic, with their final destination likely to be landfill. 
The Anthropocene is a proposed geological epoch that represents human impact on the Earth's geology and ecosystems. Dissecting the Anthropocene is a site-specific work that has been made for placement within the Mann library. Within the artwork, artificial plant forms have been dissected and displayed as pinned specimens, reminiscent of real scientific samples. The constituent parts act as a metaphor for the dissection of attitudes and values in society .The placement of the artwork in a life sciences library is a deliberate provocation. The tension between the artwork and its setting is designed to mirror the potential disconnect that can occur between science and some of the prevailing attitudes and values in society. The question is posed - what are the ramifications of this disconnect if change is to be effected?
5. Landscape with iridescence: Professor Catrin Webster
Collaborating Scientists: Dr Sarah Beynon, Dr Beynon's Bug Farm and Oxford University; Dr Heather Whitney and Mike Harrap, Bristol Bee Lab, Bristol University, UK

Light and colour are fundamental to the language of painting and to our visual experience of the world. Contemporary digital media have facilitated alternative approaches and perspectives to painting, which have shifted out perceptions through the interface of screen and camera.
This project has offered a new way of seeing and understanding colour and light, which requires the presence of the viewer, through the consideration of iridescent colour rather than additive and subtractive pigment based visual processing. The work presented here, explores alternative optical properties inspired by the way some pollinators and plants use iridescence and is the beginning of a new body of practice.","Artwork","2019","The exhibition was sited in the Mann Library College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) situated on Cornell University campus that has over 4,000 visitors pa, comprising Cornell students, alumni, in addition the public are free to access the building. There are no physical doors or barriers to the exhibition space which means that students are able walk through the gallery. There is a public cafe, and a Makerspace. Tables, chairs and power sockets in the gallery encourage students and library users to meet and study in the gallery space. They are able to view and learn about the art on show even if they have not intentionally gone to see the exhibition. When the work was being installed several people asked questions and looked the work.
A film about the project was made and is available on You Tube
A story of the project was featured in Cornell News which reaches over 23,000 readers. (http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/05/art-science-collaboration-spotlights-pollinator-health) and in NY Ag- US journal New York Ag - http://www.newyorkagconnection.com/story-state.php?Id=570&amp;yr=2019&amp;fbclid=IwAR1t43k9kGnFZE-hdclgWqAQz7jlDsIZDIFszq8fA3jzDcpt6KDUKbr3WKI 

The outreach event programme consisted of a range of talks, lectures, workshops and receptions to appeal to a wide audience and were held over the time period of the exhibition. The programme was advertised using attractive promotional materials widely throughout the campus and were sent to alumni (25,000+). 
The exhibition was held in a library gallery to encourage exchanges of ideas about the role of conceptual art that wouldn't normally happen in a library. Library users make repeat visits and as a consequence see the work several times- this offers more possibilities of engagement that visiting a gallery once - it also may mean that viewers notice new things or and gives them audience more time in which to gain an understanding of the artwork and its message.
The library as a site means that there is a wider audience visiting than in a separate art gallery building. The population studying and working at Cornell university is 23,600, which consists of 22% international students, 18% are from underrepresented minorities (Black, Hispanic, Hawaiian, American Indian) 16% underrepresented US minorities.
By exhibiting artworks that address the scientific and environmental problems in innovative and surprising ways with unusual materials, the artwork is able to attract attention in surprising and thought-provoking ways- it might even offend or disrupt ideas about aesthetics/ beauty etc and challenge environmental issues. For example Trivedy's Anthropocene was made from deconstructed plastic flowers, Townsend's Wild Strawberry, utilised contaminated beeswax that had been sent to her from the Mc Art lab research project,which means that it physically embodies cross-contamination. Liggins's characterful bee portraits gave the photographed (pinned) bees from the Cornell university insect collection (CUIC) special significance via portraiture, focusing on physiognomy and expressions of the specimens, each bee adopted its own 'personality' provoking emotion rather than viewed as a record of specimens and presented as such. The work asks the audience to consider and confront their own ideas about art- it might even offend or disrupt ideas about aesthetics/ beauty etc and challenge environmental issues. Some people talked about the aesthetic value of Trivedy's work in a negative way, by doing so this forced them to consider why plastics is used to make fake flowers and plants but are considered beautifuland that this use of resources could be seen as ridiculous, wasteful and offensive as well as an contributing to harmful environmental pollution. Assistant professor Mc Art, said that it was a revelation to him that beautiful artefacts with a poignant ecological message 'hidden in the material' could be made from the waste products from his research. Through this collaboration the message of 'invisible' contamination was communicated via the artwork label and through exhibition interpretation- talks and film.
The exhibition was an effective vehicle to showcase and interpret the pioneering scientific research of Cornell University Entomology Dept, and artist involvement can be a very important tool for creating awareness of the important issues the research is addressing. McArt went further to say, 
'We need to better understand our pollinating insects if we are to help to conserve them. By focusing on less well known pollinators such as hoverflies, using unusual media such as recycled glass and plastic grass, and by looking at pollinator eye-level imagery, the exhibition expertly brought the hidden world of scientific observation to the eyes, ears and hearts of thousands of visitors'","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j0BY77VMyk","6047789f351733.94983213","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=6047789f351733.94983213&grantRef=AH%2FN00597X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/N00597X/1","AF5C5F5A-F5F0-411B-878D-6360246B1BE2","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","7D8346F1-4332-4E10-A513-F2A5B463A923","059EC835-FD25-406D-A849-5BD0D33B0DE7"

Buchler's photographs are part of the collection of the Museum of Photography in Braunschweig - where she lived and worked.Through different picture cycles she examines the care of orphaned children and wounded troops, Germans at work and at leisure - including a fascinating series made late in the war entitled 'Women in Men's Jobs'- presenting the dislocations of war along with striking moments of human warmth.

The Grosvenor Gallery exhibition is co-curated by Manchester Metropolitan University historian Professor Melanie Tebbutt and visual artist Jacqueline Butler. This cross-disciplinary approach ensures that the final collection is the result of different perspectives - the history of the war, significance of Buchler as a woman photographer and her artistic excellence as an 'amateur'.

Professor Melanie Tebbutt, Professor in History at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: &quot;Buchler's carefully choreographed images chronicled convalescing soldiers, children collecting for recycling campaigns, and babies in war nurseries and are a documentary homage to how ordinary women and children were rising to the challenge of food, labour and material shortages on the home front. Buchler's calm, disciplined interpretation of civilian life, distant from the violent upheavals of military action at the front, suggest empathy and belief in the human spirit.&quot;","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2018","Plans have been made for further interdisciplinary collaborations","http://www.art.mmu.ac.uk/news/item-7089/","5aa66b4200e1c3.30802188","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5aa66b4200e1c3.30802188&grantRef=AH%2FP006698%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P006698/1","C091354E-25D6-4A87-A761-1BA095ECB8BB","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","1F3E180F-D70F-446C-92C8-4AD9771A8636"

Anthology of writing by participants in creative writing workshops, convened within the Storying Sexual Relationships project. These previously unpublished writers join some established young British Muslim writers in this collection, published by HopeRoad, which describes the collection as follows on its website:

Although outsiders often expect Muslim women to be timid, conservative, or submissive, the reality is different. While some of these authors express a quiet piety and explore poignant situations, others use black humour and biting satire, or play with possibilities.

If grooming-gang scandals grab headlines, characters are more scandalized by suitors' sloppy personal grooming. Finding the right crimson lipstick for a date or the perfect power outfit for meeting a cheating ex-husband are commoner preoccupations than the news.

Now all four episodes have been recorded and broadcast on the year's solstices and equinoxes:June 21st, September 22nd, December 21st and March 21st; they will remain available on BBC Sounds for a year. The dramas have been designed to blend a range of high-profile performers (Mark Rylance, Sophie Okonedo), with regional talent and non-professional performers and indeed conservationists such as Tom Fewins from the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust. Each episode has focused on a species at risk in the region drawing on experts at the reserve itself and beyond, bringing in organisations such as the Swallowtail Trust, the RSPB initiative 'Back from the Brink', the Environment Agency and others - likewise the sound resources in the drama are all created from field recordings in the reserves from Holy Mountain. These innovative qualities have been widely celebrated in the extensive coverage of the show in the media and also led to us being shortlisted for the BBC Audio Drama Awards 2022.","Artefact (including digital)","2021","This drama has had unprecedented coverage for a radio play; the first episode received rave reviews in The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Times ('Drama to go wild for'), the New Statesmen and beyond; the second episode was described as 'peak radio' by the Telegraph and the third was selected for 'Pick of the Week' on Radio 4. Its star, Mark Rylance has been extensively interviewed about it and offered a real platform for the debate around drama and conservation. The RSPB have likewise promoted it and it has impacted on visitor numbers to RSPB Strumpshaw as well as highlighting the plight of the species spotlit in each episode: the swallowtail butterfly, the little whirlpool ramshorn snail, the European eel and the Bittern.

The study estimated expenditure associated with biofilms in 2019; information is not yet generally available for 2020 to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biofilms are ubiquitous but particularly prominent in some sectors of the economy. These sectors form the focus of this study. We have used publicly available evidence to quantify economic activity relating to biofilms. The study assessed the focus industrial sectors of the National Biofilms Innovation Centre. The total economic impact was estimated to be almost $4,000bn globally and &pound;45bn ($62Bn) in the UK. These are likely to be under-estimates of the impact of biofilms. For example, in healthcare whilst we identified $387bn of direct costs as a consequence of biofilms (5% of global healthcare expenditure). we know that prevention of infection (strongly linked to biofilm control) is a major goal of all healthcare procedures and so impacts significantly on the world's $7,800bn health related activity. We conservatively estimate the true total economic significance of biofilms is likely to be in excess of $5,000bn. We've created infographics to reflect the results of this study and show the huge impact biofilms have on our global economy.","Artwork","2021","These highlight key facts and statistics relating to 6 international biofilm markets - personal care, human health, food processing, marine biofouling, oral care and homecare.","https://www.biofilms.ac.uk/international-biofilm-markets/","61d711216edc73.18612739","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=61d711216edc73.18612739&grantRef=BB%2FR012415%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/R012415/1","3F3CDB98-8900-47E6-ADFE-FF266C3060D6","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","21E13937-D928-40A1-B604-5D435BAF84FF"

Buchler's photographs are part of the collection of the Museum of Photography in Braunschweig - where she lived and worked.Through different picture cycles she examines the care of orphaned children and wounded troops, Germans at work and at leisure - including a fascinating series made late in the war entitled 'Women in Men's Jobs'- presenting the dislocations of war along with striking moments of human warmth.

The Grosvenor Gallery exhibition is co-curated by Manchester Metropolitan University historian Professor Melanie Tebbutt and visual artist Jacqueline Butler. This cross-disciplinary approach ensures that the final collection is the result of different perspectives - the history of the war, significance of Buchler as a woman photographer and her artistic excellence as an 'amateur'.

Professor Melanie Tebbutt, Professor in History at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: &quot;Buchler's carefully choreographed images chronicled convalescing soldiers, children collecting for recycling campaigns, and babies in war nurseries and are a documentary homage to how ordinary women and children were rising to the challenge of food, labour and material shortages on the home front. Buchler's calm, disciplined interpretation of civilian life, distant from the violent upheavals of military action at the front, suggest empathy and belief in the human spirit.&quot;","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2018","Plans have been made for further interdisciplinary collaborations","http://www.art.mmu.ac.uk/news/item-7089/","5aa66b4200e1c3.30802188","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5aa66b4200e1c3.30802188&grantRef=AH%2FL008149%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/L008149/1","D530FB2A-7BF8-4769-8C12-33550E5AF2D0","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","1F3E180F-D70F-446C-92C8-4AD9771A8636"

Summary: In 1969, Ouardia Belanteur was one of the very first Algerian women to study in the USSR, as part of programme of Algerian-Soviet educational cooperation. From a poor rural background, she and her sisters were the first in their family to receive formal schooling. Ouardia had nevertheless always been fascinated by the USSR, not least because her father was a railway worker with ties to the Algerian Communist Party. After an intensive year of Russian language study in Kiev, she studied geochemistry in Leningrad. In 1973, she was also part of Algerian delegations to the Tunis Pan-African Youth Festival and the Berlin International Youth Festival. Ouardia's story reveals the ease with which young, educated Algeria women and men were able to move between university courses and employment in the 1960s, but also women's negotiations within their own families to continue their education and travel and the frictions between more left-wing students and the more socially and politically conservative Algerian state.","Film/Video/Animation","2020","2,045 views as of 10/3/20. 24,101 people reached on Facebook, 3,542 engagements with 443 reactions, comments and shares (as of 10/3/20)

Artists include Irene Janze, Maria Vandenput, Helena Koening, Ida Voorthuis, Netty Gelijsteen. Full list of contributing artists available on youtube (link below). Original artwork co-created with refugees at Lola Lik (a former prison, now home for refugees), Amsterdam, drawing attention to themes of communication, forced migration, the waste of human lives and potential,creative resistance to oppression, and aiming to develop meaningful connections with and support for, refugees in Amsterdam. (plus additional awareness raising). a number of creative workshops with refugee children and their families culminated in a final collaborative artist work: &quot;flight hill&quot;. Below is text from the lead artist, SmARTcities creative director Irene Janze. 
 &quot;So we made the final model, looked for waste materials in and around the
prison and started to built tables.
By doing so we met people who suggested tables, told us their stories or
gave us rest materials to built with. Through the meetings and with the
materials the VLUCHTHEUVEL as we now call it changed. In English
vluchtheuvel is flight hill, flight from to flee and a hill a little bulb in the
landscape, but in fact we should translate it as traffic island, so again I
cannot translate it correctly but words play an important role in this
installation.
We built a telescope table in which you could see yourself and your
surroundings, a tone table on which you could make music, a speakers
and smokers table and a drawing table, amongst others. Again I am not
able to translate the names of the tables completely in English, but the
names are important and painted on the sidewalk and have several
meanings, not a singular one in Dutch.Hanna Arendt said: to speak is
relational, to communicate is not a one way road. Just as Hannah Arendt
(1958) proposes, we want our actions, whether theory-events, art, or
thoughts to communicate, and to be shared. In order to communicate our
thoughts, our innovations, ideas or art, we have to ensure that it is not a
one-way activity, like a one way traffic sign that we have all been
programmed to interpret in a similar manner, and which leads to similar
behaviour and predictable responses. That's why we try to speak through
the tables, to relate to the people and the situation.the names of the
tables are important It tries to offer resistance or shows a way out of the
controlled or disciplinary society (deleuze, foucoult) where there seems
hardly any escape from.
tone table = toon tafel; tone/ toon means a sound, a music tonethe
same as in English, but in Dutch it also means to show , drawing table is
in Dutch : teken tafel, you hear straight away the rhythm in it, it means
to draw but it is also the word for an animal, a leach, and it is the dutch
word for sign. The telescope table is aimed at you(many people take
selfies) and your surroundings.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2017","significant impact: public engagement and awareness raising around the issues of refugees and forced migration outlined in previous section. creative activity with marginalised group (refugees -children and their families). development of network contacts with public groups and stakeholders.","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RatsqPdEnXM&feature=youtu.be","5aa67433eb9163.38671902","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5aa67433eb9163.38671902&grantRef=AH%2FN005767%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/N005767/1","4598A97D-F879-4A7B-BBDD-100EF72446D2","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","F9F1D136-12E3-4BE4-9668-0C9BC4A7C1BF","3E97B5BB-74F1-4747-930C-40EC11445919"

A molecular mechanism of action is strongly implicated, and is a mechanism shared with several leading antimalarials in the drug development pipeline, but no crystal structure has been obtained for the protein target. This OSM project is in the lead optimisation phase, with small changes being made to the structures synthesised. Yet even now many compounds designed by the human chemists are proving to be inactive, which can be wasteful of project resources. Over the last several years the consortium has run open competitions to see if the broader community can derive more predictive models for which molecules to synthesise. The most recent, funded by AI3SD, elicited high quality, open submissions from academia and several new companies specialising in artificial intelligence and machine learning. To close the loop, and examine the utility of these predictions, several of the novel structures proposed were synthesised and evaluated in a blood stage antimalarial assay. Were the machine-assisted predictions better than those derived from human intuition? An answer will be provided.","Film/Video/Animation","2020","Forms part of our YouTube Channel.

He proposes that flows are understood by the purposeful, repetitive, programmable sequences of exchange and interaction between physically disjointed positions held by social actors in the economic, political and symbolic structures of society. Therefore we can define flows as consisting of three elements - the medium through which things flow, the things that flow, and the nodes among which the flows circulate. 'Flows' interprets these three elements through the A354's ANPR cameras, CO2 emission ratings data and vehicles.

'Flows' scans registration plates in real-time across the six camera sites on the A354 between Dorchester and Weymouth. As vehicles pass the cameras a vehicle lookup enquiry is made to ascertain data on their CO2 emission rating, which is then used to drive Arduino controlled air turbines, generating movement in six particle filled acrylic tubes. As the total amount of CO2 emitted ebbs and flows, the air rate is increased and decreased in correlation, changing the velocity of the particles. At the same time the tubes are flooded with light corresponding to the now ubiquitous environmental ratings charts. In this way, the viewer gains insight into the immaterial flow of CO2 between Dorchester and Weymouth at any given moment in time.

Over a period of several weeks the young people designed and co-created an Iron Age themed mural to signpost the trail.

They sent letters across the world to share some of their own lives with students living in very different conditions - asking about animals, and gardens, Minecraft and football, and often quite profound questions about friendship and family. And they made time capsules to send other messages forward in time. 

The artists' work is their own reflection of the creativity and enthusiasm they found whilst working with the primary school students in Wilburton and The Weatheralls School, Soham. 

Kyle Kirkpatrick's work draws on the children's curiosity about what lies beneath the ground under their feet and their reflections on how Soham has changed over time - and might change in the future. 

Rachel Wooller's work emerges from children's exploration and construction in the woods at Wilburton and thinking about how humans adapt to the shifting landscape.

These artworks brought to life the stories of the inventors and patent holders, their key influences and central themes revealed in their designs. Alice worked in the studio with the research team, directly responding to the team's findings and methodological process. She was involved in discussions about the process of conducting an ethnography of making the Victorian Cycling Costumes, the decisions, unexpected happenings, mistakes and challenges along the way. These conversation this sparked rich and complex conversations about method and findings and informed the content and feel of each drawing as it developed. The novelty of the project lies in interweaving archival research with the making of a range of garments, drawn from historic patents in collaboration with contemporary craft practitioners (artist, weaver and tailor). Although collaborations of this nature are not new, the novelty of this project lies in an explicit engagement in the process of making, curating and representing knowledge. It will bring to life findings from the symposium and workshops and provide a platform for discussion and debate about different working practices.

Not everything can be articulated through words. They can be felt corporeally, but are sometimes too painful to talk about. Some of the girls in The Relationship Matters project talked about events (such as girls being followed, or sexually propositioned to perform sexual acts for money or food) that left them word-less and choked, with 'lumps' in their throats, 'turned stomachs' or 'just numb'. 

They talked about keeping 'feelings in' that they wanted to express outwards. Attuning to their desire to both feel and express, Professor Renold spontaneously told them about an activity that took place the previous year with a group of academics and artists (see futurematters.org) experimenting with non-discursive ways of communicating and how J&ecirc;n Angharad picked up the paper we had been given and rolled and dived on it, her movement marking the paper with crumples.

Professor Renold invited the girls to express their feelings not through words but through marking the paper ruler slips (see entry for Shame Chain artefact on the significance of the ruler slips) as I read out some of the transcribed data from previous sessions. 

The girls crumpled, scrunched and teared the paper, saying,: 

It's like, it's better to get your anger out on something.

It's like a sense of relief for me.

Yeah how you react like your feelings rips them up and crumples them up until there's practically nothing left and you're left in pieces. And I reckon using paper is actually a good way of expressing that.

So you're thinking about your feelings inside the paper?

My feelings ARE the piece of paper . like crumpled up, torn up into little tiny pieces.

We were left with piles of torn pieces of ruler-paper. Aware of how these pieces were carrying powerful affects we discuss what to do with them. Some girls wanted to hold on to them. Others wanted to bin them. One of the girls expressed her ambivalence, likening the act to 'chucking my feelings away'. One glance at the green recycling bin, and the girls talked about wanted to recycle them.


In the space of 30 minutes, the girls 'recycled' and sutured their torn paper to create a powerful dartafact, which they later called, 'The Tagged Heart'. 

This was a heart that carried feelings of numbness, emptiness, anger and relief. The words: slag, fake, how much do you charge?, wolf whistling, rumour, grabbing your bum, stuck up, youth mother's a MILF, bitch, fatty, sket, beeping, look at her arse, ruler-like, fan out from the heart. 

Cracked clock faces decorated the outside, splitting time and signalling that not all feelings or 'broken hearts can be mended' with time.

Significantly, not all the pieces found their way into the heart. As one of the girls said: 'they're the parts of the broken heart that never got mended'. These pieces went into the recycling bin.","Artefact (including digital)","2015","School Assembly: The making of the Tagged heART was shared in the girls Healthy Relationships Awareness Raising Assemblies (300 students, 20 teachers). 

The Tagged Heart was passed around the assembly hall, and, in awareness of how the tagged heart was created, students were asked to 'look after our feelings' because 'these are our feelings'. Indeed, contrary to one of the girls' initial fears that the heart might get 'trashed' (the rubbish bin surfacing again) the heart was passed from student to student, very carefully, remaining intact, touched by and touching over 300 students

Over a period of several weeks the young people designed and co-created an Iron Age themed mural to signpost the trail. The mural was designed and developed by the young people during a series of intensive street-art workshops devised by Paul Evans, in close collaboration with St Fagan's Iron Age expert and artist Ian Daniel. To set the context, the young people visited the Iron Age reconstructed hillfort at Castell Henllys in West Wales. Here they engaged in two workshops devised by Paul. The first, a digital photography activity, was based on the micro-montages of street artist Slinkachu, and the other was a variation on eco-graffiti activities that Paul had used to effect during previous stages of the project. In this instance, the young people left their outlines on the side of the fort - a biodegradeable impression of their visit. 

Back at the youth centre, the young people engaged in two days of drawing workshops, generating letters and figures that Paul and Ian developed into finished designs for council approval. The young people were then given a choice of five designs based on their ideas and motifs - with Ian's design getting the vote. The mural design features two Iron Age Round houses, 'Ely beans' and graceful 'celto-graffiti' lettering spelling out the word Caerau (meaning 'hill-forts' in Welsh). The A4 sized mural design was then scaled to full size - over 15 metres in length - and painstakingly applied onto the underpass and in masonry paint. The young people from the youth centre participated in the painting and added their own graffiti 'tags'. The resulting artwork constituted a vivid, direct, contemporary connection to the pre-historic past which has since been incorporated into the HEART of Cardiff Heritahe Trails network.","Artwork","2013","The CAER team, including artist Paul Evans and Ian Daniel (Celtic demonstrator from the National Museum of Wales), worked with 3 Youth Workers to develop and devise a programme of heritage themed trips and create an art installation with a small group of young people facing exclusion. This required a significant number of meetings and close collaboration during the course of this small project. Contact has been maintained with the Youth Centre and other groups of young people from there have subsequently participated in Caerau excavations and continue to be involved in the ongoing reconstruction of an Iron Age Village at St Fagans National History Museum.","http://caerheritageproject.com/caer-blog/","545cc0c7a3d284.74371610","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=545cc0c7a3d284.74371610&grantRef=AH%2FK007726%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/K007726/1","17B47F7E-846B-4A42-848F-9D07B369FC99","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","9C10D78F-6430-4CA7-9528-B96B0762A4C6","252D4770-A5D9-40F1-8DFE-0A250F9CD404"

He proposes that flows are understood by the purposeful, repetitive, programmable sequences of exchange and interaction between physically disjointed positions held by social actors in the economic, political and symbolic structures of society. Therefore we can define flows as consisting of three elements - the medium through which things flow, the things that flow, and the nodes among which the flows circulate. 'Flows' interprets these three elements through the A354's ANPR cameras, CO2 emission ratings data and vehicles.

'Flows' scans registration plates in real-time across the six camera sites on the A354 between Dorchester and Weymouth. As vehicles pass the cameras a vehicle lookup enquiry is made to ascertain data on their CO2 emission rating, which is then used to drive Arduino controlled air turbines, generating movement in six particle filled acrylic tubes. As the total amount of CO2 emitted ebbs and flows, the air rate is increased and decreased in correlation, changing the velocity of the particles. At the same time the tubes are flooded with light corresponding to the now ubiquitous environmental ratings charts. In this way, the viewer gains insight into the immaterial flow of CO2 between Dorchester and Weymouth at any given moment in time.

It is also a lament for what is fast becoming a lost way of life. Flower and pollinator rich hay meadows are the treasured wildflower fields of our youth but these abundant and productive systems for grazing livestock have become
increasingly rare with the advent of modern sugar rich grasses such as rye, along with the pressures to intensify production. In less than 100 years this intensification has wiped out 97% of traditional hay meadows in the UK, with the associated wildlife they support. This 'green-washing' of the countryside, with the emphasis on regulated green squares of land,
is destroying our wildlife. The desire for tightly manicured green spaces is echoed in the domestic environment as we intensively mow our lawns resulting in a kind of 'green death'.
This artist's film, informed by the discussions with project scientists, is not a documentary, but an interpretive snapshot of these two very different systems. The intention is to prompt the viewer into making connections between the wider issues surrounding environmental farming practices in relation to domestic gardening practice.","Film/Video/Animation","2017","This artwork was one of sixteen developed for the Cross-pollination exhibition which to date has been held at the National Botanic Garden of Wales (throughout all parts of the Garden) and at Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, Pembrokeshire, where it currently is still on show. Plans are in place to exhibit as part of the Bath and Bristol Festival of Nature, June 2018, and Cornell University, USA in 2020. In 2017 the number of visitors to the exhibitions totalled 29,804. There were 8 days of workshop sessions with schools, families and young people with learning difficulties, a total of 414 participants. Other activities around the exhibition included 5 art crits where the work and exhibition was discussed between participants (scientists, economist, and artists) including a linguist who was researching art/science communication through this project. Notable impacts include A) One of the main aims of the project was to demonstrate to scientists that art research can contribute to scientific research and that collaboration with artists would be a valid practice. There has been a complete seed change, from what was initial scepticism from many of the scientists, to complete involvement and appreciation of the benefits of such collaboration. In impact terms this could be measured by the inclusion of artists in new projects and future proposals for funding. Of the six science teams involved in the project, two teams have applied for and received funding which now included artist/ art researcher participation and the remaining teams have planned collaborations with artists, some who were participants in the project. In addition the organisations involved i.e. The Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Buglife, Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, the Heart of Wales Line. Arriva Trains, and the National Botanic Garden of Wales are all continuing to collaborate with the project after funding. B) The exhibitions, conference and public/schools workshops have informed the public about the pollinator crisis and material evidence has been collated to demonstrate that there have been behavioural changes as a response to greater knowledge of pollinators and the problems facing them.","https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com","5aa3d087271071.29998962","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5aa3d087271071.29998962&grantRef=AH%2FN00597X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/N00597X/1","AF5C5F5A-F5F0-411B-878D-6360246B1BE2","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","7D8346F1-4332-4E10-A513-F2A5B463A923","059EC835-FD25-406D-A849-5BD0D33B0DE7"

It is about the story of Lampedusa, from the colonisation of the island in 1843 to its recent growing militarisation, its stories of fishing, the island's main economic resource until the 80s, its histories of migration. The show also narrates the &quot;epic&quot; tradition of Lampedusa: Ludovico Ariosto chose this island as the setting for the fighting between three Christians and three Sarracins; then Lampedusa was a prison where anarchists, like Enrico Malatesta, were confined; and more recently it has also become a military base. Lampemusa offers also a picture of the local stories, which Sferlazzo has collected from the old people, most of them linked to some historical places such as the Sanctuary of Porto Salvo's Madonna, where Muslims and Christians had prayed together for centuries.

Drawing from the tradition of the Sicilian storytellers, Sferlazzo plays the guitar, the &quot;marranzano&quot;, the percussions, and other instruments he himself invented.

Giacomo Sferlazzo is a political activist from Lampedusa, songwriter, and a re-assembler of matter, colours, objects, photos, waste. He has made four records as songwriter, with Jacopo Andreini he has realised an album of experimental music, &quot;Nella pancia della Balena&quot; (In the belly of the whale). For years he has searched for stories and memories about Lampedusa, thus gathering them in his show Lampemusa, based on songs and narrations about the different stories of migration that have crossed the island. In 2009 he founded the collective Askavusa, with which he organises the Lampedusainfestival and realised Porto M, a multifunctional space where the objects of the migrants landing in the island, are exposed, after being salvaged from the cemetery of the boats by Askavusa.","Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)","2017","The concert was a real attraction during this event.

Two-channel video installation (10'15&quot;), 4.1 audio system. Courtesy of the artist and Belmacz.
The video-installation takes as a starting point a water leakage that occurred at the Dubai 
Aquarium inside the Dubai Mall in 2010. Juxtaposing the Internet footage of the recordings of 
the incident with the artist's recent first hand recordings inside the Dubai Aquarium, the video 
wants to question the idea of aquarium both as a window into an underwater world, a display 
of marvels, as well as an artificial and problematic reproduction holding wonder and anxiety 
tightly together.
Projected into two separate screens Acquavideo links visually and conceptually the fish tank 
and the Dubai Mall as enclosed spaces of desire, imagination, power and control. The first 
section of the video suggests captivity, playing with excessive point of views; glimpses and 
gazes of this extreme visibility. The editing of the moving images creates constricted architectural partitions, planes and perspectives. The shops in the Mall reflects their logos and lights 
onto the glass panels of the fish tanks creating a visual intoxication of these two enclosed 
spaces. This excessive tension escalates into a short circuit, a figurative and symbolic crack 
into the system that make the second part of the video collapse into a nocturnal dimension. 
Darkness envelops what is visible and the viewer slips into an immersive acoustic space, sliding into a submerged world that is both hypnotic and fictional, realistic and surreal. The soundscape registers this shift, from a sound pollution to an absorbing acoustic atmosphere.
The video installation hold together, reverses and mirrors these perspectives. The two screens 
interplay these dimensions like communicating vessels. Both a visual and symbolic outflow, 
Acquavideo is an intimate journey into
subliminal desires, pressures and mesmerising visions. Ultimately, the work reflects on the 
relationship between consumerism and wonder using the affinities of fish tanks or the aquarium to windows displays, as both are carefully designed to allow viewers (or consumers) to 
imagine, escape and disengage from their own everyday reality.

We were interested in applications from any art form. We were not seeking a polished artwork but the involvement of an artistic process in the creation of new knowledge. We develop an open call (deadline 22.1.2016) and received 22 applications from music, environmental arts, performing arts, dance, creative writing, photography and sound art. The level of application was high and international - UK, Spain, Netherlands, Romania, Australia, Malta, Austria and Lithuania. The selection panel included Douglas (PI), Fremantle (CoI) and Price (SRF). The criteria for selection included understanding of the research context, previous work i.e. experience and quality of the proposal in response to our brief and its framing in the research topic: cultural leadership and the place of the artist. Rosanna Irvine,a dancer with a practice-led PhD, was appointed and joined the research team in the Spring 2016.

As artist in residence, Irvine attended the four seminars through this phase of the research and supported the core team in the development of each seminar. She was present as witness and as participant. She offered a different participatory artistic intervention for each seminar. Each intervention set out to be an embodied investigation to complement the more discursive elements of workshop delivery. She drew on the discussions and aspects of the theoretical framework that was emerging through the research. Drawing on Arendt's notion of leading as both beginning and following through, Irvine challenged how particular artistic processes might change how we experience ourselves acting - and how they might forge a 'leading' - in the world. Each intervention focused on the physical dimension of the discussion as an aspect of its content.","Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)","2016","Each created a different rhythm to the discussion, inviting us to pay attention to the human dynamics and quality of encounter across the four events.

After the purchase, a new screen situates the choice within the pool of choices previously made, all anonymised, displaying the supply most likely to be ordered next. 

The machine also presents some autonomous features: it can order coffee and reward customers for helping with its maintenance, e.g. by refilling coffee beans, filling its water tank, and cleaning out used coffee grounds. When Bitbarista detects that a maintenance task needs performing, it will request help from customers and offer either free coffee or a payment in Bitcoin in return. Bitbarista is fitted with a small camera, enabling it to read smart codes for Bitcoin transactions, so that it can make payments to customers' Bitcoin wallets.","Artefact (including digital)","2016","BitBarista has formed an integral part of a study on initial perceptions of data transactions with a new Internet of Things device.

In deriving these Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs); a number of considerations have been made; synthesis of the available published work on water, hygiene and sanitation carried out; simplification of the technical language for easy to use friendly messages for uptake; identification of tools and resources needed for increased uptake of WASH in Cameroon and Angola.



Here we provide a range of training materials that can be used to support capacity and capability building in participatory design and community engagement in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH).

The Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) are alternative methods for treating household water in the contexts of Angola and Cameroon. These aim to facilitate communication and discussions with public, private and non-profit sector organisations that can support communities in implementing safer options for water treatment in their contexts. There are advantages and disadvantages to each one of these methods. For instance, treatment with chlorine does not eliminate all pathogens and long-term use is not recommended. The Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS) method is an effective way of eliminating pathogens when compared to chlorine but may produce a limited volume of treated water. Despite the disadvantages, the SOPs are an important stepping stone as treating the water significantly reduces the risk of disease. Some of the resources mentioned in the SOPs are made available to local communities by local organisations, such as NGOs. The viability and feasibility of methods are critical to ensuring the adoption by local communities. Therefore, the most appropriate method for water treatment needs to be defined in dialogue with communities, understanding potential challenges in implementing those beforehand and crafting solutions that are suitable for them considering their livelihood diversity, environmental and socio-cultural aspects.

The SOPs are freely available in Portuguese and English.","Artefact (including digital)","2021","Digital and print copies distribted to communities in Angola, as well as to NGOs in Camerron and Angola who work in the area of WASH.","https://wash-able.org/resources/training-materials/","621de8de2b5688.10294821","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=621de8de2b5688.10294821&grantRef=AH%2FT008482%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/T008482/1","BBD67331-40B0-4703-9576-CEEDBF061E46","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","AA0B7D66-0C34-4A32-BCEA-587A49F9C9C3"

The interviews were conducted in the autumn of 2014 by the legal journalist Joshua Rozenberg. Taking part were: 

 The last of the &quot;old&quot; Lord Chancellors, Lord Mackay of Clashfern.

 The transitional figure of Lord Falconer, who negotiated the changes of behalf of Tony Blair's government.

 His successors as &quot;new style&quot; Lord Chancellors combined with the post of Justice Secretary, the senior cabinet ministers and MPs Jack Straw for Labour and the Conservative Ken Clarke.

 On behalf of the judiciary, the successive Lord Chief Justices of England and Wales who were the first to become heads of the judiciary:

 Lord Woolf, Lord Phillips who went on to become the first President of the Supreme Court, and Lord Judge.

The constitutional reforms did not happen smoothly. They began with the abrupt dismissal of the Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine in 2003 and finally emerged after detailed and often tense negotiations between the judges and Tony Blair's government, ending up in compromises between the two sides that were still being worked through more than a decade later. The reforms focused on the Constitutional Reform Act of 2005. They terminated the centuries-old three-fold operation of the office Lord Chancellor as the head of the judiciary, Speaker of the House of Lords and a cabinet minister. They created a Supreme Court, a more independent system for appointing judges and a judiciary more independent and separate from government.

In these interviews with seven of the most senior office holders, we hear the inside stories of how the reforms came about, and a range of subtly different views on how judicial independence has been affected in the early years of the reforms.

The interviews appear in overlapping chronological order:

Lord Mackay of Clashfern
Lord Chancellor 1987-97

Lord Woolf
Lord Chief Justice 2000-05

Lord Falconer

Mann library, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14855: 15th April - 30th September 2019. Seven of the original artists involved in the Cross-pollination project and three new artists. The publicity for the exhibition states &quot; The new Mann Gallery exhibit, PolliNation: Artists Crossing Borders with Scientists to Explore the Value of Pollinator Health showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between Cornell entomologists, UK based scientists and Welsh artists who, crossing national and disciplinary boundaries, work to reveal and celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.&quot; Two of the research team members will accompany the exhibition and will give talks and presentations to alumni, students and staff. The exhibition has been timed to coincide with the Entomology Departments Alumni Festival. Seven of the 10 artists who are exhibiting have produced new work that has been developed from the previous Cross-pollination exhibition 2017. Below is a description from the accompanying exhibition texts for each of the new pieces.

PolliNation PORTRAITS,
Professor Andrea Liggins,
Collaborating scientist: Assistant Professor Scott McArt, Dr Jason Dombroskie, Cornell University, 
Digital colour prints,
Most people when asked to describe a pollinator will think of a honeybee or a bumblebee such as Bombus terrestris (Europe), not realising that there are 25,000 known species of bee in the world (about 4,000 in the USA and 250 in the UK). A quote from the British writer John Fowles suggests &quot; The greatest threat to our countryside is less the physical harm we do than a growing detachment from that reality&quot;. These portraits attempt to address the separation of people from the diversity and richness of these wonderful and very important creatures. They were collected from around the world, Bolivia, Australia and Argentina for example, and from as far back as the 1800s. 
This work originates with Andrea Liggins working in collaboration with Dr Andrew Lucas, photographing forgotten and overlooked landscapes, the wild, marshy fields of Wales and the forgotten pollinators themselves - Hoverflies. During a 4 day visit to Cornell University, Liggins was introduced to the amazing insect collection (CUIC). She spent her visit making these portraits of bees, hoverflies and moths, assisted by a research student Paige Muniz.
Liggins says of the photographs &quot;These are not sharply focused images, that show you what the bees and hoverflies look like in all their scientific detail but are meant to be portraits, that engage you with their 'being'. I don't know whether bees and hoverflies have personalities, but I saw each of them as an individual, full of character. I felt that I came to know each one, as a portrait artist would get to know the sitter and I hope that comes across.&quot;

FROM THE COLLECTION: NEST AND EGGS
Sarah Tombs
Bees wax, Bronze and Glass
Assistant Professor Scott McArt, Assistant Professor, Dr Peter Graystock, Cornell University, New York 
 
In August 2017 Sarah Tombs visited Cornell University to observe Dr Graystock and his team undertaking field research. During the visit Tombs looked at pollinators eggs and nests in the Cornell University Insect Collection. Some nests and eggs are found hanging from branches, this became the inspiration for her bronze and glass sculptures. 

DISSECTING THE ANTHROPOCENE
Daniel Trivedy
Collaborating Scientists: Dr Peter Graystock, Cornell University, now at Imperial College, London
There has been a noticeable trend towards the use of artificial plants in our everyday environment; the omnipresence of synthetic topiary balls and artificial grass are a common manifestation of this trend. It appears that some members of the public want to be surrounded by the forms of nature but in a way that is clean, sterile and user friendly. The use of non-biodegradable plastics to create these forms is problematic, with their final destination likely to be landfill. 
The Anthropocene is a proposed geological epoch that represents human impact on the Earth's geology and ecosystems. Dissecting the Anthropocene is a site-specific work that has been made for placement within the Mann library. Within the artwork, artificial plant forms have been dissected and displayed as pinned specimens, reminiscent of real scientific samples. The constituent parts act as a metaphor for the dissection of attitudes and values in society .The placement of the artwork in a life sciences library is a deliberate provocation. The tension between the artwork and its setting is designed to mirror the potential disconnect that can occur between science and some of the prevailing attitudes and values in society. The question is posed - what are the ramifications of this disconnect if change is to be effected?

FRAGARIA VESCA: WILD STRAWBERRY
Annette Marie Townsend
Collaborating Scientist; Assistant Professor Scott McArt, Cornell University
The concept for this artwork was conceived following a chance conversation between scientist and artist at the Cross-Pollination Conference in 2017. Since that time, scientific data and wax samples have been sent across continents and the concept has grown into a piece of collaborative scientific art. 
The Fragaria vesca, Wild strawberry sculpture, created using traditional wax model making techniques, has been made from honey bee wax provided by Dr. Scott McArt, Assistant Professor at the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the NYS Beekeeper Tech Team. The honey bee wax, collected from bee colonies in New York State, has been analysed and found to contain pesticide residues. As the sculpture contains traces of these agricultural chemicals, they have been listed as artist's materials. 
Wax has been used by artists in the creation of scientific models for education and teaching since the late 17th century, and botanical wax model making reached a height of popularity during the advent of the public museum in the 19th century. The translucency and life-like quality of the material enabled artists to create realistic and beautiful representations of plants for gallery displays, in order to engage visitors with scientific discovery. 
This work continues this tradition, aiming to raise awareness of the widespread use of agricultural chemicals and the transfer of these chemicals from agricultural crops to wildflowers and pollinators, promoting discussion on the man-made issues which have contributed to the global decline of pollinating insects. 

ETCHED ENTOMOLOGY
Annette Marie Townsend
Collaborating Scientist; Assistant Professor Scott McArt, Cornell University
The series Etched Entomology was inspired by the scientific collections at Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales. Techniques normally used in printmaking, printed circuit board manufacturing and jewellery design have been combined in an innovative way to produce a series of closely observed images. Each image is hand drawn directly onto a copper surface, which is then etched, oxidised, sanded, scored and polished. 
The oxidation process produces an outer surface layer on the copper plate, protecting the delicate copper insect. The etched drawings play on the themes of darkness and light, encasement, detail, repetition, order and protection, all observed within the museum environment. 
Each handmade plate is unique and marked with an identifying series of letters and numbers, echoing the collection reference system employed by museums.

FRAGILE TRACES
Artist- Carly Wilshere-Butler
Collaborating Scientists- Dr Sarah Beynon, Sarah Sharpe, Dr Natasha de Vere, Phd students Abigial Lowe and Laura Jones
Conservationist- Sinead Lynch
The purpose of the fragile traces project was to illustrate the fragility of our pollinators and their habitats. To begin with the project concentrated on moths as they are often less revered than their cousins the butterfly, although they carry out an equally important role at pollinating; often doing their important job unseen at night. 
Initially photogram images of moths in bell jars were produced to illustrate the need for their protection. During field trips, bee walks and engagement workshops it became apparent that it would be far more successful to help the public create this connection themselves and to emphasise the importance of pollinators. Also people often learn kinesthetically so retain the important scientific information more readily if they learn by doing. For this reason two outcomes were created, one multisensory video and secondly a series of cyanotype workshops. 
IN GIRUM IMUS NOCTE ET CONSUMIMUR IGNI
This film highlights the issue of artificial lighting which is adding to the moths decline as they naturally navigate themselves by the light of the moon.
The title can be interpreted in different ways and one such interpretation is that they are flying to the light, beckoning us to take notice and change our practices. The fragile glass dominos represent the moths decline as each species becomes extinct one by one. As the footage slows there is a likeness to bells ringing heard as the glass dominos fall. A link was made to the poem 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' by John Donne, in which interpretations have suggested he was trying to draw people's attention to how the world is interconnected. Further research discovered that bells are often placed at the doors to places of worship to cleanse people's minds and leave them open to new ways of thinking. In the second part of the video the moths are resurrected suggesting that we can bring back our moth population or at least preserve the species we have; by listening to new scientific research and adopting new practices that work alongside nature and not against it.
Cyanotype pollinator prints.
The cyanotype prints represent the engagement workshops held at Dr Beynon's Bug Farm and at The National Botanical Gardens of Wales. Participants were encouraged to walk through wild flower meadows enabling them to see and experience the pollinators in their habitat. They were then able to pick plant material and record them by creating cyanotype prints similar to those to the ones Anna Atkins created in the 1800s; she was the first female photographer to combine art and science. In the relaxed environment of the workshop people were able to learn the plants names while touching the specimens therefore retaining the information more readily. When creating prints some plant material was only placed loosely on the paper by participants to create blurred and faded prints creating depth as if a plant is in the picture and also illustrating the pollinator's ephemeral qualities.
This project was developed further to create prints for this exhibition incorporating plants used and identified to be good pollinator plants in the DNA Barcode project run by Natatasha De Vere and her PhD students at the National Botanic Gardens of Wales. The images illustrate the surprising results that honey bees often use trees and hedgerow plants and only supplement with wild flowers and weeds; travelling further even if selected flowers are closer. The plant material used were specimens from the DNA Barcode project so were labelled, it was decided to leave these in the prints to show where they came from and to show the ethos of this project which is part of the Barcode of Life initiative, where all findings are open access.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2019","As a result of the Cross-pollination project and the collaboration with scientists, some of the artists have moved into news methods and ways of working. Conceptually the artwork shave been enhanced and enriched. The project has developed strong links between the artists, scientists and the two universities, Cornell University, U.S.A. and UWTSD and has provided the opportunity for an international exhibition. It is intended that this will lead to further collaborative work and visits. The exhibition will reach new audiences, alumni, students, researchers and staff as it is timed to coincide with the Entomology Department's Alumni Festival.

A description of the film in the artist's own words:
Swallet (25minutes, 29 seconds, Colour: HD Video, with sound).
Swallet (noun British, an underground stream) is an experimental film that drifts in its own momentum; the soundscape is constructed from wild sound recorded during filming.
Dr Steve Hanson, for Manchester Left Writers, has written that in 2018 it is no longer 'beneath the pavement the beach', to quote the Situationist International, but 'beneath the pavement the void' (Hanson, 2018). He makes reference to the sinkholes opening up in Manchester, under the Mancunian Way and elsewhere, as the urban landscape succumbs to drastic environmental change. These holes mirror others, diamond mines in Russia, vampiric human cavities observable from space, the holes in space-time and the void left by the complete closure of anything that passes for radicalism outside the comfortable museum of 1960s rebellion. In this sense it is necessary to make work that is not weighed down by the inflated baggage of the soixant-huitards (the May 1968 student demonstrators), but work that is symbolically open to the present we are in, which is always already one of terrifying contingency: this is how our world is 'radical' today. 
As we look back at 1968, it is important that the commitment to avant-garde symbolic openness and radical contingency is adhered to. My film, therefore, is in this spirit, which is in fact in the spirit of Debord's films, even if it does not look anything like them. For how could it? 
The film was shot during a drift through the city centre in Lincoln. The images in the film slip and slide. Sometimes objects, markings and the ground are recognisable; often they are abstracted and incomprehensible, flickering with an interminable variety of movement and immeasurable gradations of colour. The lens is ungoverned by normative perspectives; there is no compositional logic, and no horizon line. The soundscape is constructed from wild sound; noise from construction sites, walking, traffic, and street sounds including a busker.

A spread sheet program offers the same function of how a account clerk was once employed, to add up long rows of data, but what the program lacks in the work place is the subtle effects of humanity in a work situation. The non work social-interactivity between employees when a task is completed, is what makes the next number crunch bearable. A slight subtle movement in air can cause a butterfly effect in our acquisition of data and experience, a marginal thought explored.

The Marginals are locked into total engagement, They are the agents of the archive, like a colony of ants they march forward and chomping through the archive, the rule based system they function under being their only motivation, but over time they come to produce a larger community. 

 Like a busy New York tenement block, each Marginal brings a different story to the overall picture of the environment it inhabits. A communal commonality based on familiarity and circumstance rather than action,practice or interest.

This marginal existence could be seen as a urban digitised office space community.The Marginals are the hum and buzz of a busy office, the diversity of the Marginals draw the users attention to non-specific work/non work tasks away from the solo input node of the modern work station, a modern day Hawthorn effect.

 A previous work of mine, Making Friends And Enemies, investigated the production of a community of computer agents dealing with the cross over of machine/human consciousness, here the characters became the artist, and the artist became the characters, anticipating the coming of post humanity where the boundary between us and our agents is dissolved.

 With the Productive Marginals the boundaries between the archive and it agents become blurred, aspects of the archive talk to other aspects of the archive and refers to aspects of itself rather than a external reality, like the library in the book &quot;The Name Of The Rose&quot; by Umberto Eco, &quot;books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told,&quot;, in our case the Marginals offer up this information feedback up to the user, in an hope to offer insight to how the project see's itself. 

 The Marginals could be seen as the archives unconsciousness, producing a host of signs and signals in the same way we dream,the Marginals themselves being based on archetypal artists and philosophies that deal with aspects of divining information. Like an oracle looking into cloudy water the user can contemplate the information space and architecture that the archives agents create.

Amongst works from Brazil, Mexico, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Germany and France, the four project partners' books were specifically foregrounded, along with works from the publishers Yiyi Jambo and Elo&iacute;sa Cartonera. The exhibition included four short films, documenting different methods of constructing cartonera books and a longer documentary by the filmmaker Isadora Brant. 

The exhibition had a fully operational public programme with team members a constant presence in the exhibition space. These team members were based at a workstation equipped with cardboard from the Glic&eacute;rio recycling cooperative, paints, paintbrushes, boxcutters etc - in short, the items of a typical cartonera workspace - so that visitors, seeking to take home the exhibition catalogue, could bind and decorate it with cardboard, thus creating own cartonera book and engaging with the processuality of cartonera. The workstation also provided a free printing facility so that visitors could bind in cartonera form whichever PDF text they had chosen. Over the duration of the exhibition, over 300 catalogues were created in this manner and roughly 30 scholarly and activist texts were bound, allowing us to work alongside people integrating cartonera, both literally and affectively, into their research process, making plain the transition of a literary work into the processual and visual sphere. 

The Casa do Povo venue was chosen because of its connection to the local community and welcoming people into a shared space was at the forefront of our minds in designing the exhibition. The public programme organised a series of events and a cartonera symposium, sparking unexpected connections, all of which occurred within the exhibition. We would like to highlight three particular events here. First, the cartonera collective Dulcin&eacute;ia Catadora led three workshops in the exhibition space exploring immigrant women's perspectives of S&atilde;o Paulo. The participating group, compromising representatives of different feminist and LBT (lesbian, bi, trans) collectives, worked together to create a series of texts that spoke to their experience of living in Brazil's largest city. Over the three sessions, the participants created 'Somos mulheres imigrantes', a cartonera book of these short texts, which through a complex series of folds, became an A2 placard of protest to be used in a march following the third session. Second, in the process of working throughout the exhibition, two members of the public programme team created their own cartonera publisher, Sin Fronteira Cartonera. Over a series of sessions, Sin Fronteira produced six books, including Dialogos, reflexiones y desafios en Colombia: Hacia un feminismo popular, a text organised by the Colombian feminist collective Red de Mujeres de La Sabana. And finally, to close the exhibition, we organised the event 'Iy mun ku m&atilde;k pax', designed to bring into focus languages spoken in Brazil beyond those of the colonizers, Portuguese and Spanish. This event took place over two days and, inspired by the bi-lingual texts of the cartonera collective Yiyi Jambo that create a deft interplay between Portunhol Selvagem, Portuguese and Guarani, the event sought to work with themes of how colonial structures have systemically silenced indigenous languages and literature. Juanito Cusicanki and Beatriz Morales of Aymara and Quechua ethnicity respectively, were invited to present their indigenous alphabets based on their oral knowledge. In the second workshop, representatives of Guarani, Pankararu and Baniwa peoples spoke about their experiences of state kidnapping and the subsequent imposition of Portuguese on their communities. Contextualised by these moving accounts, the title of the event came to hold a particular significance: from the shamanic chant maxakali / tikmu'un, Iy mun ku m&atilde;k pax means 'my beautiful voice'.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2018","- In total the exhibition received circa 2,500 visitors

Selected comments from the visitors' book:

I came into the Casa do Povo without knowing what I would find and I was surprised and delighted to come upon this exhibition. It was a very unexpected and comforting moment in my day. It was great to be able to enter into the universe of the cartoneras, and in such an interactive and heartfelt manner! Ra&iacute;sa 21/12/2018

I entered the Casa do Povo for a meeting on the theme of libraries and I was pleasantly surprised by this exhibition. I immediately thought of developing something for my students as I am a teacher in a state high school. I learnt all about Cartoneras and I was really well received by Maria Paula, of the public programme team. Louisa 15/01/2019

Lost for words! You have showed us how to do so many things without the need for making things too complicated. Simply beautiful. J&uacute;lia 31/01/2019

Thank you so much for the experience! It was a learning process that seemed simple but it made me so happy and so enthusiastic about producing my next book! Thank you!

sound of its own, but rather it attempts to draw our attention to the sounds already present by framing them in a new way.
Named after the organ of hearing in your inner ear, it uses the acoustic technology of sonic crystals to accentuate and attenuate
frequencies within the broad range of sound frequencies present in road traffic or falling water.
By recycling surplus sounds from our environment, we hope to challenge expectations of what might constitute a piece of music
by adding nothing to the existing soundscape but rather offering new ways of listening to what is already there.
We very much hope that this instrument might be a device that rematerializes our experience of sound and becomes itself an
invitation to &quot;listen to ourselves listen&quot;.
The instrument itself consists of four-meter high cylinders which constitute a sonic crystal. This crystal alters the predominant
frequencies from the location it is situated - a road, weir, river for example - and plays them back attenuated and enhanced without
the addition of new sounds. The sonic crystals filter the sounds that envelop its surroundings, allowing musical structures to be perceived. Thus, the instrument may be perceived as sculpting day-to-day noises into a composition that questions one's notion of musicality and indeed the genesis of music itself.
One questions whether the soundscape of the everyday could be, or already is, music.
Such acoustic surprises, created from the known world, resituate and ground the listener within the aural environment.
Through once dulled senses, the ears listen consciously, actively once more - cutting through the noise and hyper-stimulation
of contemporary life. One listens via the Organ of Corti and is transported to a world sculpted and formed in and from sound.
One melts into the saturated soundscape, thinking and moving as sound, questioning what is it to listen. What it is to listen to
one's self listening.
Mindful of the origin of the Organ of Corti's 'world composition': a mediated soundscape filtered from the environment and made
celestial through cutting-edge technology, it could be said that the conceptual and structural qualities of the crystal frames the sonic landscape (whilst the physicality of the Organ of Corti acts as a focal point for causality and context for the listener). This framework allows one to listen - perhaps more acutely, certainly differently, and to notice that difference. Thinking analogously here, the Organ of Corti heightens awareness of the aural sense, allowing one to listen to sound comparable to the way that the eyes 'look' and 'watch'. One is thus able to challenge assumptions of the hierarchy of looking and listening. Within the Organ, the ears rule.","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2010","Winner of the Performing Rights Society Fund New Music award in 2010.

It will incorporate a range of existing and new interactive installations and activities from interdisciplinary research projects. As an important environmental indicator with rich global cultural and social heritage, the honeybee is a potent symbol. As evidenced by our previous extensive public engagement activities, this complex and fascinating insect captures the imagination - everyone has a bee story!

Take part in our Beespoon installation and find out how much honey a single bee makes in its lifetime!
• Our Beespoon is 1/12th the size of a teaspoon and represents the amount of honey a single bee can make within her lifetime. Help us to think about the work of a bee by doing some work to try and fill the beespoon! By making an origami flower and placing it on our wall display, you will earn the chance to press the beespoon installation button. If you're lucky, a drop of honey will fall onto the beespoon, filling it up, drop by drop. 
• This activity allows participants to engage in the act of making, learning about how little honey a single bee makes, and leading them to reflect on the honey that they might put on their breakfast toast, how many bees it takes to make a jar of honey, and how far a single bee will fly during its lifetime. We will ask participants to think about their own life-times achievement. 

Design a beehive!
• What are honeybees and what are they for? This activity introduces participants to different kinds of beehive that are designed to encourage bees to do different kinds of things: bees can make honey, they pollinate flowers which produces fruit and vegetables, they rear their young, they guard their colony, and they exchange information by dancing on the honeycomb. We will design posters to explain how different beehives work, introduce the importance of the 'beespace' to honeybee architecture, and then ask participants to design their own hive
• This activity will encourage participants to reflect on how human perceptions of honeybees lead us to reach into and shape honeybee worlds

Feel like a bee, feel like a beekeeper

• Make a pair of bee glasses, and see the world from the perspective of a bee. Bees have five eyes - two of which are compound eyes, each with its own lens that looks in a different direction. Can you imagine what it would be like to inhabit a world that looks like this? 
• Learn to interpret the waggle dance, and draw a map to find out how bees show each other where the best flowers are. 
• Learn how a beekeeper uses their eyes to spot the queen, larvae, and worker bees on a virtual frame from a beehive; their ears to listen to the sounds of the hive and find out what they mean; and their nose to smell the scent of a healthy hive","Artistic/Creative Exhibition","2017","Ongoing - the event is in April 2017",,"58c9b15e21c045.87387236","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=58c9b15e21c045.87387236&grantRef=ES%2FM000834%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/M000834/1","12A0E1A0-D0EC-4C84-A9D1-129CA5EE51E9","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","545D3041-8FF6-4BB9-BCFE-7DC5ED222EA8"

The three films respond in different ways to the Situationist International's ideas, which have been explored over the duration of the project. 
The three films will be:

Drifting Apart by acclaimed Glasgow-based artist, Stephen Sutcliff (https://lux.org.uk/artist/stephen-sutcliffe): 
A description of the film in the artist's own words: 
The film will involve a new collage video work comprised of found and self-shot footage. This work will explore the fractious relationships, which dogged the situationist movement, particularly the inclusions and exclusions which happened under the de facto leadership of Guy Debord. My work displays a fascination with awkwardness. In the 1990s I was taught by Alan Woods, who through Ralph Rumney, a British member of the Situationist International, was an associate of the movement. My work thus questions accepted narratives through the use of contradictory imagery and sound. These clashes will suit the subject matter he has chosen to explore. 

8 Ball 
1968, 2008, 2018 
by Lee Hassall (https://leehassall.org/)
A description of the film in the artist's own words:
Dr Steve Hanson wrote that in 2018 it is no longer 'beneath the pavement the beach', but 'beneath the pavement the void' (Hanson, 2018). He references sinkholes opening up in Manchester as the urban landscape succumbs to drastic environmental change. These holes mirror others, diamond mines in Russia, vampiric human cavities observable from space, and the void left by the closure of anything radical outside the museum of 1960s rebellion.
It is necessary to make work that is not too weighed down by the baggage of the soixant-huitards, work that is symbolically open to the present we are in: A commitment to avant-garde openness and radical contingency; my film is in this spirit.

Glasgow Glam Rock Dialogue: 7 - Debord
Carl Lavery and David Archibald, 
 A description of the film by the academics making it: 
 This is a film for Guy Debord. At a time when the 1968 celebrations threaten to fossilise his ideas, we plan to blast him out of his historical continuum. To make him live again.
 Channelling the spirits of David Bowie, Suzi Quatro and Walter Benjamin, this short film gives Debord a much-needed Glam Rock injection. Guided through the streets of Glasgow by The Angel of History and aided by songs and debate, we reflect on the Situationist International and its afterlives. Our aim is to resist neoliberal techniques of control, surveillance and discipline, and to re-affirm the SI's politics of ecstasy, excess and pleasure.","Film/Video/Animation","2018","The films will enable a wide general public audience to understand some of the Situationist International's critiques of neoliberalism and the ways in which pleasure and enchantment can be reintroduced into everyday life.",,"5aa06ab7416004.77098183","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5aa06ab7416004.77098183&grantRef=AH%2FN504592%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/N504592/1","57579CA6-2A72-49FE-A212-8A8583634D37","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","C6D0044A-2CD2-4167-B90B-922AF53E361F","78DFF849-6070-47FD-B308-D8F693137037"
