Following this proof of concept, additional funding has enabled the project team to substantially expand the remit of the tool to include food, timber, greenhouse gas sequestration, recreation, water quality, water quantity and biodiversity provided by the current composition of land use across England and Wales from 2020 out to the year 2060 based on mid-level projections of climate change from the IPCC (UKCIP09). The tool can be used at a variety of spatial scales including country, government office region, local authority, catchment and subcatchment, national parks, or the finest resolution which is a 2km grid cell level. 

Alter: Users are also able to use the tool to define scenarios which alter the current land use or prices. The tool predicts the response of land use and the flow of ecosystem services over time.
Optimise: The tool also includes an optimisation functionality which allows users to specify an objective (e.g. maximise economic value from woodlands, or maximise quantity outcomes such as a biodiversity metric) and a policy mechanism e.g. replacing agricultural land with new woodlands. The tool then calculates the optimal spatial locations to achieve the objective and returns a breakdown of the locations and changes in ecosystem service flows.

by visual observation and estimation when crop walking which leads to inaccuracy and bias as well
as being costly and time consuming. In collaboration with our partner organisation who will

The toolkit emphasizes the importance of comparing estimates for alternative states of a site (for example, before and after conversion to agriculture) so that decision-makers can assess the net consequences of such a change, and hence the benefits for human well-being that may be lost through the change or gained by conservation.

The toolkit has attempted to find a balance between simplicity and utility of developing convincing information for decision-makers and therefore excludes consideration of some of the more advanced concepts in ecosystem services.

A collaboration between The University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (SRC) in Trinidad and Tobago, the National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the British Geological Survey (BGS), myHAZ-VCT is designed to provide scientists (SRC), emergency managers (NEMO) and citizens of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, with first-hand information about a range of natural hazards and environmental phenomena that occur in the country.

Through the myHAZ-VCT app you can upload photos, videos and free-text descriptions on a range of natural hazards including flooding, storms, landslides, earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis and other environmental phenomena such as drought, ground subsidence and changes in water levels. In addition, there are more detailed, optional questions to answer to help scientists, emergency managers and your fellow citizens know what is going on across St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

When a new observation is submitted, it is initially reviewed by myHAZ-VCT managers at SRC and NEMO, and then published in the app for other myHAZ-VCT users to view. A commenting facility within myHAZ-VCT lets users, SRC scientists and NEMO staff respond to observations, whilst SRC and NEMO can also send direct notifications to myHAZ-VCT users, such as further information and advice about ongoing hazards.

myHAZ-VCT uses a citizen science approach for gathering valuable data on various natural hazards occurring in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Citizen science is the active involvement of the non-scientific public in scientific research. Since scientists and emergency managers cannot be everywhere, enlisting members of the public like you, in sharing observations on multihazards can provide a broader understanding of the impact and behaviour of these in your community. This information can be used by NEMO to respond more effectively to impacted communities as well as to develop robust hazard mitigation systems.

It includes modelling results from the first national infrastructure long term planning tool, created under the first phase of the ITRC, and currently being utilised to inform a national infrastructure needs assessment for the National Infrastructure Commission. The NISMOD platform is made up of four sections:
NISMOD-LP - Long term performance of interdependent infrastructure systems
 Integrated engineering-based simulation models of demand and capacity for infrastructure services in the energy, transport, water, waste water, and solid waste sectors of Great Britain's National Infrastructure system.
 Links between the sectors are included through cross-sectoral demand for services, e.g. energy generation requires water, waste water treatment requires energy, etc.
 The interconnected simulation models are run from a single input framework and a single database (NISMOD-DB), acting as an repository for both the model inputs and outputs and as the reporting warehouse and post-processing facility.
 NISMOD-LP allows the assessment of national cross-sectoral strategies for infrastructure provision based upon a multi-dimensional performance metric, including cost of service, carbon intensity, supply security, etc.

NISMOD-RV- Risks and vulnerability in national infrastructure systems
 A detailed hierarchical representation of the real-world assets and networks of the energy, transport, and water infrastructure sectors.
 Stochastic climate projections and hydrological modelling derive profiles of natural hazards such as storms and floods that threaten infrastructure assets and systems.
 A risk analysis framework uses the profiles to examine the robustness and vulnerability of existing and hypothetical configurations of national infrastructure networks.
 NISMOD-RV allows assessing different national strategies for infrastructure provision based on their risk-footprint under climate change.

NISMOD-RD- Regional development and how it adapts to infrastructure provision
 A generic representation of national infrastructure systems as networks, assisting the transport of resources, goods, services, people, and the externalities of economic activity, allowing for further integration of different infrastructure sectors.
 The generic representation is integrated into a meso-scale model of economic growth and development to assess the role of infrastructure for growth.
 A spatial interaction model to assess the impact of infrastructure performance on local attractiveness for migration.
 Combining these approaches ,can simulate the co-evolution of the socio-economic and the national infrastructure system.

NISMOD-DB - Infrastructure networks, demand and performance

 Combines hundreds of data layers on Great Britain's infrastructure systems within a spatial database framework (using open source languages).
 A scenario and output repository for the NISMOD-LP and NISMOD-RV models.
 Includes nnovative algorithms for the identification and synthesis of national scale infrastructure networks from incomplete and unstructured maps.

NISMOD-INT - A generic framework for international applications of NISMOD
 A series of open-source analysis tools known for the application of evidence-based decision making in a diverse range of possible international settings.
 Providing recipient countries with the capacity to develop and assess alternative infrastructure transition strategies for meeting their future sustainable development goals.
 Capable of combining rapidly emerging global datasets with country-specific engineering insights and on-the-ground assessments.","Software","","2015","The following organisations/ agencies have been utilizing the NISMOD tools as an analytical framework to inform their decision-making processes:

1- National Needs Assessment

The National Needs Assessment (NNA) was an Institution of Civil Engineers initiative to examine the UK's likely infrastructure needs in the coming decades - set against uncertainties such as climate change, population growth, global energy prices and economic change. It also looked at the way infrastructure networks relate to, and depend on, one another and how this will impact on the performance of networks in the future.
We provided the primary evidence for the NNA through our modelling framework for analysing the relationships between and among infrastructure networks. Our scenarios set out the main demand drivers on infrastructure - population growth, climate change, technology, economic trends.
The National Needs Assessment sets out a vision for how infrastructure delivers economic growth, thriving communities and embraces technology to deliver a low carbon future. It is a blueprint for the National Infrastructure Commission's (NIC) long term infrastructure assessment.

2- United Nations Office for Project Services
Working with the Government of Norway, ITRC and UNOPS, an operational arm of the United Nations, we are pioneering modelling tools, support and guidance to governments to enable robust future planning on national infrastructure. The tools will include assistance for long-term planning, focused for development projects, and designed to allow governments to efficiently use existing assets, prioritise new projects, and use financial resources to deliver maximum socio-economic benefits to local communities.

5- National Grid - spatial modelling for Future Energy Scenarios
National Grid used the NISMOD tool to forecast use of of renewable technologies, embedded generation capacities and customer demand projections in the long-term. National Grid needed an analysis tool to:
 integrate different data sources
 assign transmission and distribution level assets to key renewable technologies (such as solar, wind and photovoltaic installations)
 aggregate outputs from distribution regions to the grid.
The output was used with National Grid's own Future Energy Scenarios forecasting models to provide a demand allocation, by area, for different technologies and scenarios.

4- JBA Trust - bridge scour analysis
JBA Trust looked at probabilistic scenarios for railway bridge failure due to extreme floods. Our team used the NISMOD-RV software to build demand loss estimates for these different failure scenarios to produce a flood risk analysis for railway infrastructure. Our work with JBA Trust produced recommendations to Network Rail on their network asset management plans.

5 - Infrastructure UK (IUK), UK Treasury

The FaIR model converts emissions of greenhouse gases and short lived climate forcers to a concentration and radiative forcing time series, and from there to a global temperature anomaly. Natural forcing from solar variability and volcanoes can be supplied externally. It is written in Python, is compatible with Python 2 and Python 3, and is available on PyPI and at GitHub. 
Description
Simple models are needed because full complexity Earth system models that are used in climate change projections such as those used by the IPCC are expensive to run. FaIR is designed to emulate the behaviour of more complex models. The input parameters to FaIR can then be varied to assess the responses in the full range of uncertainty to the carbon cycle, radiative forcing and temperature response.
The carbon cycle component of FaIR is based on a modified four time-constant impulse response function that simulates the behaviour of complex earth system models remarkably well. It was developed by SMURPHS Chris Smith, Richard Millar, Zeb Nicholls and Myles Allen at Oxford University. This is version 1.0 of FaIR, described in Millar et al., 2017.
For a full assessment of future emissions scenarios, non-CO2 gases, and short lived forcers such as aerosols and tropospheric ozone precursors should be included. The FaIR model was extended to include these emissions. The latest version is 1.3.

Preset alerts can be triggered to keep you informed of sudden changes, extreme levels, or irregular data. Whether in the office, on site, or travelling between locations, the Omnis+ system app and online dashboard allow you to review data when it suits you. Built specifically for Android and iOS devices, as well as offering multi-browser support, the app will fit around your schedule and working routine. Any release of sewage or slurry to an aquatic environment will introduce bacteria which will then grow rapidly and multiply. These bacteria use up oxygen in the water, causing dissolved oxygen levels to drop rapidly. When dissolved oxygen levels fall rapidly, this is extremely harmful to the aquatic environment, with visible symptoms such as fish dying en-masse also regularly in the news.

Because human sewage leads to Tryptophan activity, we can measure such spillages of human waste into aquatic environments with a Chelsea Technologies UviLux Tryptophan sensor, which is included in the Omnis+ sewage detection system. Our tryptophan sensor can help identify leakage from sewer pipes in river locations, and, if put together with other Chelsea sensors such as an OBA (optical brightening agents) sensor, even ultimately differentiate whether it is due to farming or human activity.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2022","Initital sales, growth of business","https://chelsea.co.uk/chelsea-technologies-announces-new-water-quality-alert-system-for-sewage-pollution-algae/","623205d0a4b2d3.66679579","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=623205d0a4b2d3.66679579&grantRef=NE%2FR003106%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/R003106/1","702BCD03-F266-47C7-8374-A1FF0C1D56A8","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2A80FFDA-3B8B-43BA-80C3-3AA850B49BA1","4C967AF8-9A8A-499A-92B6-B4BAFEEA27CD"

Despite the substantial resources required for open data, there is an expectation that making data accessible will drive innovation and strengthen the economy. The Open Data Institute (ODI) and Nesta, the UK's innovation charity, claim that open data could strengthen the UK economy with a five to ten fold return on every pound invested.

The impetus for this project was the realisation there remains a significant gap between the availability of raw data from UK government websites and the ability to use this data in a research or business context. Substantial resources are currently being wasted through the need for individuals to carry out numerous repetitive manual tasks in order to obtain data in an appropriate format. By providing suitable data science techniques, we show that it is possible to bring raw data to life by offering summary statistics, extremes, distributions and trends. We also offer a user-friendly download portal and application programming interface (API) to facilitate developers.

The Met Office is the national weather service in the UK. Weather, climate and environmental data have been identified as a key priority for the UK's open data program. DataPoint is a service to access freely available Met Office data feeds in a format that is suitable for application developers. We focus on long-term historical weather observations at a monthly time scale for 33 stations in the UK. The Climate Historic database provides observations on maximum and minimum temperature, rainfall, sunlight and air frost.

This project demonstrates how to bridge the gap between raw data and usable data in a refined and structured format. We welcome feedback on how this process could be improved and scaled up to include other datasets. Input from practitioners that need to use weather and climate data would be particularly useful.","Webtool/Application","","2015","Private sector practitioners have used the website to access climate data

It can be used:

1. to generate long time-series suitable for the assessment of agricultural and hydrological risk;
2. to provide the means of extending the simulation of weather to unobserved locations;
3. to serve as a computationally inexpensive tool to produce daily site-specific climate scenarios for impact assessments of climate change.

LARS-WG version 5.0 includes climate scenarios based on 15 Global Climate Models (GCMs) which have been used in the IPCC 4AR (2007). This large dataset of future climate projections was produced by leading modelling groups worldwide who performed a set of coordinated climate experiments in which GCMs have been run for a common set of experiments and emission scenarios. Multi-model ensembles allow to explore the uncertainty in climate predictions resulting from structural differences in the global climate model design as well as uncertainty in variations of initial conditions or model parameters.

Gail used her research to develop a proposal called EnviroSAR, which won the Copernicus Sustainable Living Challenge 2016 for its commercial potential to be the UK's first wildfire mapping tool. The team were also runners-up of the overall Copernicus European-wide competition. KfWf supported the team by helping to obtain support in kind from Fire Services, water companies and the England and Wales Wildfire Forum, and advising on the writing the application. In this sense it is a spin-off from the KE Fellowship.

The University of Manchester Intellectual Property management service advised the project, with support from the School of Environment, Education and Development.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2016","EnviroSAR team use Copernicus development funding, in-kind support and mentoring from the UK Satellite Catapult to develop a web geoportal to assist Fire Services, water companies and conservation bodies to map and monitor wildfire burn scars, especially in peat moorlands. Mapping is not routinely done by Fire Services and is only available for a small proportion of UK National Parks, yet clean-up of water discoloration costs water companies millions of pounds. The technique uses radar intensity and coherence to map the perimeter of moorland wildfires. It can also monitor their persistence to assess natural regrowth of vegetation and the success of ecological restoration. Because uses C-band radar images are used, it is ideally suited to exploit the new European Space Agency Sentinel products. A spin-out company was set up in 2017 (see Spin outs; EnviroSAR).
EnviroSAR established a technical partnership with Sterling Geo, a market-leader in geospatial data and services. Sterling Geo intend to co-develop a geoportal infrastructure to combine remotely sensed images and maps with photographs and other user ground data on wildfire burn scars.

The game contrasts practices that can lead to cooperation and collective action versus those that result in a tragedy of the commons. This 'serious game' was developed by the International Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre (IGRAC), The Netherlands, in partnership with the Groundwater Futures in Sub-Saharan Africa (GroFutures) project of the UK NERC-ESRC-DFID-funded Unlocking the Potential of Groundwater for the Poor (UPGro) Programme. The Institute of Development Studies (IDS), UK, has been leading the social science elements of GroFutures and working with IGRAC to refine the game and facilitate a set of engagement activities in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Niger, using the Groundwater Game to open up discussions with key stakeholders on 'groundwater development pathways'. Previously, the game had some technical limitations that restrict its broader applicability. IGRAC has commissioned IDS to assist with addressing one of the main constraints in the current game set-up: streamlining data input provided by players to the Game Manager (GM).

Programming was done to improve network connectivity between the GM's computer and players' devices (using laptops or mobile phones running Android software). This allowed the exchange of data through a server either running locally on the GM's own PC. 

A prototype was developed in early 2020 to:
1. Connect a Router to the GM's PC to run a local Wi-Fi network for the game (low-cost Wi-Fi routers are available for less than €40). 
2. Develop an Account Management System (AMS) for the server to handle player logins.
3. Create a Data Management System (DMS) that would accept player data input, update the Excel spreadsheet and keep the GM informed of the status of players' data input for each round of the game. 
4. Develop a Custom App to enable players to log in to the server, enter and send data and display information from the server using their PCs or mobile Android devices (in this first phase, we did not develop the app for Apple devices, as this would require additional programming and development).

This set up requires participants at a typical Groundwater Game workshop to have Android phones to send and receive data and the GM to have a Windows PC with a relatively recent version of Excel installed. It also requires a basic Wi-Fi router to connect the phones to the GM's PC via the game App. Assuming these technologies are available, set-up time to connect the devices should be quick and relatively straightforward.","Software","Yes","2020","The Groundwater Futures team has successfully used earlier, spreadsheet-based versions of The Groundwater Game in multi-stakeholder workshops in our Basin Observatories in Ethiopia, Niger and Tanzania as a means of breaking the ice and introducing concepts such as 'groundwater development pathways', sustainable groundwater management, and 'regulation from above and below'. We believe this new version will be a significant improvement on the previous ones as it will accelerate the game cycle and focus players' attention more on their tactics and strategies rather than game modalities.

The game contrasts practices that can lead to cooperation and collective action versus those that result in a tragedy of the commons. This 'serious game' was developed by the International Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre (IGRAC), The Netherlands, in partnership with the Groundwater Futures in Sub-Saharan Africa (GroFutures) project of the UK NERC-ESRC-DFID-funded Unlocking the Potential of Groundwater for the Poor (UPGro) Programme. The Institute of Development Studies (IDS), UK, has been leading the social science elements of GroFutures and working with IGRAC to refine the game and facilitate a set of engagement activities in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Niger, using the Groundwater Game to open up discussions with key stakeholders on 'groundwater development pathways'. Previously, the game had some technical limitations that restrict its broader applicability. IGRAC has commissioned IDS to assist with addressing one of the main constraints in the current game set-up: streamlining data input provided by players to the Game Manager (GM).

Programming was done to improve network connectivity between the GM's computer and players' devices (using laptops or mobile phones running Android software). This allowed the exchange of data through a server either running locally on the GM's own PC. 

A prototype was developed in early 2020 to:
1. Connect a Router to the GM's PC to run a local Wi-Fi network for the game (low-cost Wi-Fi routers are available for less than €40). 
2. Develop an Account Management System (AMS) for the server to handle player logins.
3. Create a Data Management System (DMS) that would accept player data input, update the Excel spreadsheet and keep the GM informed of the status of players' data input for each round of the game. 
4. Develop a Custom App to enable players to log in to the server, enter and send data and display information from the server using their PCs or mobile Android devices (in this first phase, we did not develop the app for Apple devices, as this would require additional programming and development).

This set up requires participants at a typical Groundwater Game workshop to have Android phones to send and receive data and the GM to have a Windows PC with a relatively recent version of Excel installed. It also requires a basic Wi-Fi router to connect the phones to the GM's PC via the game App. Assuming these technologies are available, set-up time to connect the devices should be quick and relatively straightforward.","Software","Yes","2020","The Groundwater Futures team has successfully used earlier, spreadsheet-based versions of The Groundwater Game in multi-stakeholder workshops in our Basin Observatories in Ethiopia, Niger and Tanzania as a means of breaking the ice and introducing concepts such as 'groundwater development pathways', sustainable groundwater management, and 'regulation from above and below'. We believe this new version will be a significant improvement on the previous ones as it will accelerate the game cycle and focus players' attention more on their tactics and strategies rather than game modalities. 

The new Data Input prototype will be tested in a number of training situations with post-graduate students in the UK in late March / April 2020. After the new version is finalised, IGRAC will make it available through its website.",,"5e68be18ca4709.65702491","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5e68be18ca4709.65702491&grantRef=NE%2FL001748%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L001748/1","F6939F0E-9F21-4E73-8F1E-91500EDE9A00","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","EC4F2E5A-4422-4138-B776-A8EA97D40887","4F91D3F7-AC95-4BFE-87D3-9C633AFBAA01"

It is designed to be quick and simple to use, only requiring input data that are readily available on-farm, but also achieving predictions that are sufficiently accurate to robustly demonstrate options for improved resource use. Different inputs of organic resources to the soil affect resource use in the whole system. Increased inputs of carbon (C) to the soil lead to increases in the soil organic matter, which impacts the water holding capacity and nutrients available to the crop. This affects crop production, which has an impact on animal production using on-farm feeds. The water holding capacity of the soil and growth of crops and animals all affect the requirement for water. Crop production determines the amount of crop residues available to feed to animals and for use as a fuel, and so determines fuel availability (both as crop residues and as dung) and the labour required to collect additional fuel (such as wood). Water use, crops grown and the animals on the farm also impact labour used in farming operations. This then affects labour and time available for off-farm activities. The income and expenditure of the farm are a function of the purchases made by the household (e.g. food, feed, fuel &amp; fertilisers) and the labour and products available within the household (e.g. grain, milk &amp; animals for sale).","Software","","2019","Use to assess potential methods to increase soil organic matter and reduce nitrogen waste in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.",,"620e4b02e7b016.02576761","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=620e4b02e7b016.02576761&grantRef=ES%2FP002501%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/P002501/1","B1092E06-4D46-4BC8-A5A6-0D97E20FB1C3","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","F7E13617-2678-475B-99E4-31479C92038D","E9F3C794-6725-4251-917F-B62420EDAF42"

The PITV-LIF system has direct industrial application from understanding particulate dispersal, e.g. microplastics to viral aerosols, sustainable energy management to monitoring biogeochemical processes.

The current public health crisis has focussed researchers' attention on the way that microscopic particles move through air and liquids. We know, for example that particulate pollution correlates to adverse health outcomes. Measuring and understanding why this happens has historically been challenging because the environments in which we interact with - air and waterborne particles - on a daily basis are complex and multi-dimensional. This equipment gives us an opportunity to replicate those kinds of environments and fine-tune them to help us understand lots of different processes, from how viral aerosols behave under difference forces, to what changes the way that microplastics move through the oceans.","Systems, Materials & Instrumental Engineering","","2022","n/a",,"6204edb3357c13.39482822","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=6204edb3357c13.39482822&grantRef=NE%2FV017160%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/V017160/1","6AC1D1C7-77EA-4C24-8DD5-108865EAE372","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","8A0FC07A-04CD-4F7A-9095-1D2E6C1D918F","1D30ED5F-8B2C-4565-88A6-04918F73D90E"

It is designed to be quick and simple to use, only requiring input data that are readily available on-farm, but also achieving predictions that are sufficiently accurate to robustly demonstrate options for improved resource use. Different inputs of organic resources to the soil affect resource use in the whole system. Increased inputs of carbon (C) to the soil lead to increases in the soil organic matter, which impacts the water holding capacity and nutrients available to the crop. This affects crop production, which has an impact on animal production using on-farm feeds. The water holding capacity of the soil and growth of crops and animals all affect the requirement for water. Crop production determines the amount of crop residues available to feed to animals and for use as a fuel, and so determines fuel availability (both as crop residues and as dung) and the labour required to collect additional fuel (such as wood). Water use, crops grown and the animals on the farm also impact labour used in farming operations. This then affects labour and time available for off-farm activities. The income and expenditure of the farm are a function of the purchases made by the household (e.g. food, feed, fuel &amp; fertilisers) and the labour and products available within the household (e.g. grain, milk &amp; animals for sale).","Software","","2019","Use to assess potential methods to increase soil organic matter and reduce nitrogen waste in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.",,"620e4b02e7b016.02576761","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=620e4b02e7b016.02576761&grantRef=NE%2FP004830%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/P004830/1","44D4F2B2-107B-430A-9433-54CFE6D70BDF","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","F7E13617-2678-475B-99E4-31479C92038D","1B6D154F-8C59-43EB-88A7-81F28EB7EA78"

The system represents the combination of three models, which can, if required, be run separately. It has been designed to assess the combined impact of climate, land use and groundwater abstraction changes on river, drainage and groundwater flows, groundwater levels and, where appropriate, SWI. The approach is interdisciplinary and reflects an integrated water management approach. The system comprises three packages: the Distributed Catchment Scale Model, DiCaSM, MODFLOW and SWI models. In addition to estimating all water balance components, DiCaSM, produces the recharge data that are used as input to the groundwater flow model of the US Geological Survey, MODFLOW. The latter subsequently generates the head distribution and groundwater flows that are used as input to the SWI model. Thus, any changes in land use, rainfall, water management, abstraction, etc. at the surface are first handled by DiCaSM, then by MODFLOW and finally by the SWI. The three models operate at different spatial and temporal scales and a facility (interface utilities between models) to aggregate/disaggregate input/output data to meet a desired spatial and temporal scale was developed allowing smooth and easy communication between the three models. MODFLOW and SWI are in the public domain. DiCaSM, has been developed for unsaturated zone at Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, CEH and equally important, is the interfacing utilities between the three models. DiCaSM simulates a number of hydrological processes: rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, infiltration, soil water movement in the root zone, plant water uptake, crop growth, stream flow and groundwater recharge. Input requirements include distributed data sets of rainfall, climate data, land use, soil types and elevation. The model produces distributed and time series output of all water balance components including potential evapotranspiration, actual evapotranspiration, rainfall interception, infiltration, plant water uptake, transpiration, soil water content, soil moisture (SM) deficit, groundwater recharge rate, stream flow and surface runoff.

This package is designed to allow the rapid analysis of spatial data stored as ESRI shapefiles, handling all of the geometric conversions. The resulting data can be written back to shapefiles to allow analysis with other spatial data or can be plotted using matplotlib.

The code is built upon the pyefd module and it is hoped that this package will allow more geoscientists to apply this technique to analyze spatial data using the elliptical Fourier descriptor technique as there is no longer a data conversion barrier to entry. This package is also more feature rich than previous implementations, providing calculations of Fourier power and spatial averaging of collections of ellipses.","Software","Yes","2017","This software has been cited four times, including in the transportation literature.","https://spatial-efd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/","5e610e6c8892d7.98743051","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5e610e6c8892d7.98743051&grantRef=NE%2FJ009970%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/J009970/1","7EB6F092-F242-4F42-9F43-9D0A6A254C33","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","8C7D51B6-8E00-4A85-977D-16E47E7569BE"

On one hand, BRACED intervenes to Building the Resilience and Adaption of communities to Climate Extremes and Disasters; on the other hand BRAVE intervenes to Bridging science-practice-policy to build livelihoods resilient to drought. These two approaches present many common points of interest which have instigated a joint action supported both by the scientific and technical expertise of the BRAVE project, as well as by the operational aspect and research interest in building resilient communities through the BRACED program. The purpose is to provide the knowledge and capacities needed by rural communities to efficiently manage groundwater resources as part of building their resilience.

In Burkina, more households own livestock and groundwater key to year round water access (94% own livestock in Tomo and 97% for the other communities. In Ghana, the use of water for irrigation correlated to household demography and wealth (e.g. in Jawani and Samini fewer own their house compared to Tariganga and Akara; larger households with more children in Jawani and Samini).

South African students highlighted topics around water use, informality and solid waste management. UK students highlighted topics around mixed use development, sustainable transport, and nature conservation. This testing phase had some limitations in terms of student buy-in for non-assessed work and difficulties with timing meant that online discussions between the South African and UK students could not take place.
A second phase of work with the app was undertaken with different cohorts of students in spring and autumn 2018. The autumn cohort included students working in the UK on technology and urban space and South African planning students collaborating on the theme of mapping the informal economy. Overall 33 images and comments were collected by Birmingham students and 68 by South African students. These revealed very interesting contrasts in the understanding of informality between the two student cohorts. Nonetheless, as with the earlier attempts, there were significant problems coordinating activity between the two groups of students and fitting this exercise into established teaching structures.

Operating across the desktop and mobile web, the teaching app allows students to collect data in the field and automatically upload this to a shared map. Photographs and text comments uploaded by individual students can then be seen by the wider group and serve as a prompt for discussion.","Webtool/Application","","2017","Initial testing was undertaken in the autumn of 2017 with students undertaking the planning masters courses run by University of the Free State and University of Birmingham. Students found both the desktop and mobile versions of the mapping app simple to use and gathered a range of information about their local areas, focussing on the theme of sustainability. South African students highlighted topics around water use, informality and solid waste management. UK students highlighted topics around mixed use development, sustainable transport, and nature conservation. This testing phase had some limitations in terms of student buy-in for non-assessed work and difficulties with timing meant that online discussions between the South African and UK students could not take place.
A second phase of work with the app was undertaken with different cohorts of students in spring and autumn 2018. The autumn cohort included students working in the UK on technology and urban space and South African planning students collaborating on the theme of mapping the informal economy. Overall 33 images and comments were collected by Birmingham students and 68 by South African students. These revealed very interesting contrasts in the understanding of informality between the two student cohorts. Nonetheless, as with the earlier attempts, there were significant problems coordinating activity between the two groups of students and fitting this exercise into established teaching structures. While the app successfully demonstrated the potential for this kind of approach to be adopted, curricula would need to be developed around this potential rather than attempting to bolt it into established modules.",,"5a9016f83c11f3.98975752","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5a9016f83c11f3.98975752&grantRef=ES%2FP00198X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/P00198X/1","C7934BC1-7F16-42BC-94F5-5FDB4CE3ABE7","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","78AEF67E-4745-40BA-ABA9-C2E56E59F0B0"

GeoCAT is an open source, browser based tool that performs real time geospatial analysis to ease the process of conducting species conservation assessments (see geocat.kew.org).

Major achievement to date (March 2017) are:
1) Several public releases of tool from beta to a stable version in March 2014, with many bugs fixed
2) The tool has been coded and enhanced allowing improved research methods and usability. The following features have been implemented within this period of development:
o Methodology and interface developed to handle multiple species - a highly requested feature from users.
o Other occurrence data sources have been added including the citizen Science project iNaturalist and Picasa images
o The ability to record temporal decline of distributions for example based on deforestation
o Options to display environmental data from other mapping sources have been added e.g. web mapping server, CartoDB, Google Fusion Tables and KML, which can be easily displayed in the map interface. Also, addition of deforestation layer is available
o Behind the scenes improvement for speed, data integration and standardisation

3) Increased research capacity generated from training for specialists. GeoCAT has been demonstrated at many times (at least 50 times since March 2014) at IUCN training courses as well as at Kew Gardens.","Webtool/Application","","2017","The tool had a public release in March 2014 to a general audience, but the impacts during its development (before and during the award) have been far reaching. 
1. Other data sources have been added and the number of users has been greatly increasing which has added value to natural history collections by increasing their effectiveness, access and usefulness.
2. Increasing the impact and usefulness of citizen science collection, through the addition of data sources from INaturalist and Picasa (Google images), as well as the existing services from Flickr.
3. Increasing the effectiveness, access and usefulness of social media for conservation and species observations, by using iNaturalist, Picasa and Flickr for species observations
4. GeoCAT has now been cited 273 times in the scientific literature (over 220 time since the NERC sponsored release one year and two months ago) and assuming two to ten assessments, is carried per publication indicates well over 546 - 2730 assessments using GeoCAT to calculate range based metrics for Red Listing. Furthermore, 273 assessments have referenced use of GeoCAT on the IUCN Red List.
5. Assessment have ranged well beyond plants to other groups in the terrestrial and marine environments
6. GeoCAT is being used by IUCN Red List Unit staff during training sessions and it is recognised as one of a suite of mapping tools used for Red Listing. 
7. Funding beyond NERC has been secured for GeoCAT, from within EN Bon and the second major release is expected in 2017.
We will continue to develop the training material including screencasts to promote the use of this tool which will increase its reach and impact for scientists, conservationists, educators and the general public in the future. Also, we envisage that the open source tool and algorithms will allow the research to be taken further by others as well as this research group (as the EUBON funding shows)","http://www.kew.org/geocat","58c7d285e2a717.51778804","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=58c7d285e2a717.51778804&grantRef=NE%2FL013045%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L013045/1","7F1AA68D-215E-4DE3-9F05-1FDBFB0AB674","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","52BA26D6-F923-4324-BCB4-8FF9F32A2311","C1988D60-8EAE-49AD-85C8-9FD2993DD09E"

This mapping software is designed for the non-specialist, acting as a visualisation and interrogation front-end for the model simulation data that sits behind the interface, requiring no user modelling. This DST supports operational (immediate) and strategic (medium to long term i.e. 10+ years) decision making through the provision of an interface that enables the user to explore: (i) areas and infrastructure (e.g. by asset-type) presently at risk (likelihood and extent) and vulnerable (economic loss) to extreme erosion events; (ii) the extent to which this erosion risk changes with climate, highlighting the differential vulnerability of infrastructure; and (iii) identify key locations and 'tipping points' at which increased vulnerability to erosion challenges operations, and current erosion control and land-use policy is no longer viable. The user interface enables interrogation of different climate change scenarios, to provide stakeholders with an assessment that can ultimately feed into a strategy that builds climate change resilience. In essence, the DST allows key stakeholders to explore the likelihood of severe erosion impacts under future climate scenarios. Consequently, the DST provides a mechanism for visualising how future erosion risk compares with the present, and where and when erosion control may need to be implemented according to the type of asset and the scale of the problem.","Webtool/Application","","2020","The software has been used by a hydrology consultancy, Waterco.",,"5e5d7e382e8b66.67637225","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5e5d7e382e8b66.67637225&grantRef=NE%2FS01697X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/S01697X/1","891A3873-DF50-4BB3-9D44-AF50ADEA1D9C","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","A0A585E0-6B0D-4643-A3A6-47943B4CBFEF","E280BB26-F91D-4CE2-AA61-7EBEAF8545D6"

EWST has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies, power-take-off systems, and mooring systems. Simulations are performed in the time-domain by solving the governing WEC equations of motion in 6 degrees-of-freedom.
EWST is derived from WEC-Sim, an open-source wave energy converter simulation tool developed in Matlab/Simulink using the multi-body dynamics solver Simscape Multibody. The EWST is also developed in Matlab, but drops the requirement for Simulink or Simscape Multibody. It also aims to be compatible with Octave, an alternative system able to process much of the standard Matlab code base. The hydrodynamic data format for both is identical, so hydrodynamic data can be easily ported between systems.
EWST replaces the mutlibody modelling parts of the code with MBDyn, an advanced multiboy dynamics simulator. An advanced Matlab code based MBDyn preprocessor is available to allow the creation of MBDyn model input files directly from Matlab. Detailed documentation of the preprocesing tool may be found in it's own dedicated manual.
Purpose
With the existance of Wec-Sim the need for EWST may nt be obvious. EWST addresses several main perceived issues with Wec-Sim.
1. Maintainability: Wec-Sim being heavily based in Simulink does not lend itself to maintenance using standard software version control systems (e.g. Git, Mercurial). Simulink files cannot be easily compared for changes using these systems.
2. Debugability: Debugging a purely code based system is easier than one based in Simulink, as the ability to step through the code and navigate the different levels of the system is more advanced. purely code-based
3. Interface design: The developers of EWST have a different interface design philosophy which is more conventional than the WEC-Sim method. The EWST interface is more oriented toward automation and batch processing than the original WEC-Sim interface. This is mainly to facilitate randomised simulation and optimisation algorithms.
4. Modifiability: Being purely code based, and with all code in one location (rather than spread throughout Simulink models)
5. Cost: WEC-Sim requires many commercial platforms to be operated, EWST can be run entirely on free software (although the performance on Matlab will be superior).
The EWST developers recognise that not everyone will agree with the points above or that they justify the creation of a separate system, but it was these needs which drove it's creation.
An aim of the project will continue to be to maintain compatibility as much as possible between the two systems

Such growth dramatically increases cyclic fatigue loadings and reduces the electricity generated by marine renewable energy devices.

Copper-based paints are usually used as antifouling technology. However, the toxicity of these paints, as well as toxic copper concentration build-up is a major concern, as were the previous organotin paint generation, which led to a worldwide ban in 2008. 

In this project, a new environmental friendly, self-sufficient and embedded system was developed. The developed technology is based on electro chlorination, which have been used for enclosed systems but never to protect large exposed surfaces immersed in seawater. The chlorine species obtained via this method are quickly degraded (half-life of several hours, depending on UV intensity). A low concentration only (0.5ppm) is required for active protection on a targeted surface. This concentration is harmless for humans as it is the same chlorine concentration present in treated water for consumption purpose. The electrical output can be set according to the harshness of the environment. In the event of power failure and uncontrolled fouling the system can be powered up to remove any growth as the production of the antifouling elements are produced at the points of attachment of the growth, the rate of removal can be accelerated by the use of longer pulses and/or higher current.

• On-line demo sites presenting different mapping products
• Lagas mapping application (https://lagas.co.uk/app)
On-line demo sites were used to demonstrate MEG outputs to project partners and others during project activity. Development of the demo sites also proved invaluable in the drawing up of technical specifications and administrative requirements of the Lagas mapping application that was successfully delivered by Vitamin Cornwall after a competitive bidding process managed by MEG and Tevi. The website has received several industry design awards (cssdesignawards.com and awwwards.com).
The Lagas webite brings together geospatial information on the relative value of natural assets and services across Cornwall with additional information including microclimate surfaces and potential crop yields under present and future climate conditions. The site provides a single hub of environmental information for a wide range of business sectors, interests and policies. Use of the application will be monitored by the collection of site statistics as part of the Tevi programme.
The site is intended as an evolving resource to make the outputs of the research community more readily available to policy makers, business, and to the general public. Website data and statistics will allow us to continue to monitor use and access. Publicity and training events, introducing Lagas to Cornwall Council staff and other audiences, have included:
• Cornwall Council event (28 Sep 2020) with 53 attendees;
• Cornwall Council event (29 Sep 2020) we had 74 attendees;
• Cornwall Wildlife Trust event (5 October 2020) we had 9 attendees.
Public access to spatial information about natural capital and services has often been limited. The technical complexity of many natural capital tools has often restricted their wider use and uptake. Lagas provides an accessible resource to allow the communication and administration of natural capital mapping and related research outputs. It is expected that the cross-organisation Environmental Evidence Group will help inform future development of Lagas and identify additional applications or developments of MEG outputs.

The cathode can be abiotic or biotic. For majority of the metals, their reduction is thermodynamically spontaneous. Such metals include Au (III), V (V), Cr (VI), Ag (I), Cu(II), Fe (III), and Hg (II), etc. Their reduction is thermodynamically favorable, and the metals can accept electron without any external voltage application. A small amount of electricity may be generated by recovering metals present in waste streams.

For some other metal recovery, e.g. Ni (II), Pb (II), Cd (II), and Zn (II), etc. an external power supply to force the electrons travel from the anode to the abiotic cathode is required, due to their lower redox potentials than the anode potentials.

For those metals, Au (III), Ag (I), V (V), Cr (VI), Cu(II), Hg (II), and Fe (III) etc. shown respectively from the highest to the lowest market values, for which the redox potential is higher than the anode potential and reduction can be assisted with simultaneous electricity generation, greater than 99% recovery can be obtained except vanadium, for which the recovery is 68% compared to the amount present in the waste stream. The maximum power generated is 6.5 W per m2 for gold; for other metals the maximum power generated is lower than 6.5 W per m2.

Cathodic reduction reactions which include primarily carbon dioxide reuse are shown to produce products, such as formic acid, methane, methanol, pyruvate, acetate, succinate, lactate, citrate, caproate, caprylate, butyrate, etc. are shown alongside their redox potentials. Usually, the product from the cathode is a mixture of many chemicals and can be targeted for biofuel production with desired properties, similar to crude oil refineries. This way, targeted recovery of biofuel is feasible.

Bioelectrochemical oxidation of organic wastes, wastewaters, lignocellulosic wastes and their hydrolysates and stillage streams from biofuel plants as anode substrates using biotic anode harvests electron, releases proton and produces hydrogen, carbon dioxide, pyruvate, formate and fatty acids, which can be reused in cathode for chemical, bioplastic and biofuel productions. Remaining cathode substrates could be wastewaters and lignocellulosic wastes and the cathode reactions are catalytic- electro- hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation and reduction reactions to produce biofuel or bioplastic or chemical as the main products and hydrogen, methane, etc. as the gaseous products. The redox potential for carbon dioxide reduction and reuse in product formation in this way is lower than the anode potential, requiring external voltage or electricity.","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115012678","56df20346e2229.37153859","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56df20346e2229.37153859&grantRef=NE%2FL014246%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L014246/1","B45DB07A-A707-4005-A8ED-D1F564C28853","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","67B34D05-3A52-4A09-8FF9-F2398D60E246","989E82E7-7E33-4A80-99D4-57158703E3C1"

Built around a flexible and modular database structure in MS Access, it models annual projections of transport supply and demand, for all passenger and freight modes of transport, and calculates the corresponding energy use, life cycle emissions, environmental impacts and external costs year-by-year up to 2100. It takes a holistic view of the transport system, built around a set of exogenous scenarios of socio-economic, socio-technical and political developments. The model is technology rich and, in its current version, provides projections of how different vehicle technologies evolve over time for 770 vehicle technology categories such as efficient gasoline internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV). TEAM has evolved from the UK Transport Carbon Model (UKTCM) that played a key role in developing the UKERC Energy2050 'lifestyle' scenarios (Anable et al., 2012a; Anable et al., 2012b) and in exploring the effectiveness of low carbon car purchasing incentives in the UK (Brand et al., 2013).

It's the mapping application that powers several of our place-based research projects, and it's also been used in university teaching.

Make Place has lots of different uses, for urban planning projects, mapping services or surveying the community on future changes to the neighbourhood. To use Make Place, first create a map and a set of questions for people to answer, and then invite people to respond to these questions through the platform. There's lots of different ways to answer these, with text, audio clips, photos and videos.

Each response you get generates a new pin on a map for other people to see and discuss, using the in-built mapping tools. You can also control exactly who can view, respond, comment or vote on your questions, and even use groups to pick selected users to participate. For example, you can make your maps private to ensure that only people you've invited can see it.","Webtool/Application","Yes","2017","Make Place has been used with primary school children participating in a neighbourhood improvement project, cyclists advocating for better cycling infrastructure, evidence-gathering residents commissioning new air quality sensors, and undergraduate students leading an urban planning project. Most recently Sara Armoush, an Open Lab PhD student, is using Make Place with a public health organisation in Lebanon to pair volunteers, and NGOs to fulfill community needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was also used by Newcastle City Council to match up NGO needs with volunteers at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.","https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/research/make-place-an-open-source-mapping-and-survey-tool/","6214b4ef6eb862.94397091","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=6214b4ef6eb862.94397091&grantRef=EP%2FM023001%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M023001/1","E7A58D37-F67E-452D-A68F-55579A67CBB4","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68","17A7892C-F132-4130-93DB-DD3901CB85DB"

Beetles can be found anywhere in the world and so do buildings. Beetles are also a virtuous example of the effective and efficient use of resources. They hardly produce any waste; in fact some species use waste from other sources for their purposes. Such a virtuous behaviour has inspired us to aim to achieve the same efficiency and effectiveness in our built environment.

At this first stage, the tool is able to quantify the embodied carbon (EC) of steel frame building structures. It requires a small set of input parameters to run and it is ideally suited for use at concept and early design stages, making very easy to explore how variations of the frame geometry (span lengths, number of floors etc.) and magnitude of applied (wind and floor) loading would affect the overall structural steel mass and EC intensity.

BEETLE&sup2; enables to estimate the structural mass of regular structural frames at concept design stage. Several structural designs, of geometrically different steel frames, can be automatically generate in few seconds. Structural analyses are performed via Direct Stiffness Method for various load combinations accounting for the frame self-weight, permanent and imposed floor loads and eight wind-load cases evenly oriented at increments of 45 degree angles. Based on the analyses results, optimised cross-sections of minimum area are iteratively computed for each beam, column and cross-bracing, according to Eurocode 3 requirements and limited to commercially available section profiles.

The conversion from mass to embodied carbon is based on Monte Carlo simulation. This choice is due to the significant uncertainty around the EC coefficients, which should be ideally representative of the specific steel being used in the project. For this reason a probability distribution of EC coefficients has been developed from primary data collected and published studies. This is then combined with another element of uncertainty related to the exact total mass of steel being used. The two are then combined randomly 5'000 times through Monte Carlo simulation to produce the final results which are presented to the user in the form of a probability density function.","Software","Yes","2018","Used in scientific research (i.e. journal articles published based on research done with BEETLE&sup2;

Predicting how populations may respond to climate change and anthropogenic pressures requires detailed knowledge of demographic traits, such as survival and reproduction. However, the availability of these data varies greatly across space and taxa. Therefore, it is common practice to conduct population assessments by filling in missing values from surrogate species or other populations of the same species. Using these independent surrogate values concurrently with observed data neglects the life-history trade-offs that connect the different aspects of a population's demography. Consequently, this approach introduces biases that could ultimately lead to erroneous management decisions. 2. We use a Bayesian hierarchical framework to combine fragmented multi-population data with established life-history theory and reconstruct population-specific demographic data across a substantial part of a species breeding range. We apply our analysis to a long-lived colonial species, the black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, that is classified as globally Vulnerable and is highly threatened by increasing anthropogenic pressures, including offshore renewable energy development. We then use a projection analysis to examine how the reconstructed demographic parameters may improve population assessments, compared to models that combine observed data with independent surrogate values. 3. Demographic parameters reconstructed using a hierarchical framework can be utilised in a range of population modelling approaches. They can also be used as reference estimates to assess whether independent surrogate values are likely to over or underestimate missing demographic parameters. We show that surrogate values from independent sources are often used to fill in missing parameters that have large potential demographic impact, and that resulting biases are driven in unpredictable directions thus precluding assessments from being consistently precautionary. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our study dramatically increases the spatial coverage of population-specific demographic data for black-legged kittiwakes. The reconstructed demographic parameters presented can also be used immediately to reduce uncertainty in the consenting process for offshore wind development in the United Kingdom and Ireland. More broadly, we show that the reconstruction approach used here provides a new avenue for improving evidence-based management and policy action for animal and plant populations with fragmented and error prone demographic data. 22-Mar-2021","Software","Yes","2021","Contribution to parameterisation of models for Population Viability Analysis","https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.qnk98sfg0","60af677cd6b2e2.46754404","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=60af677cd6b2e2.46754404&grantRef=NE%2FP004180%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/P004180/1","28B89153-0B30-4449-9733-3FF1AAD9FDCD","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","AE58F21F-3622-4382-97BB-1359BD183E9F","BA69457E-2599-4C19-AE2C-2A2531783CF0"

IDAPS is a technological initiative to provide long-term quantitative evidence for targeted investment in infrastructure and livelihoods that enable for early action and effective adaptation before the point of crisis has been reached. Scaling-up such targeted investments across African member states is a grand challenge due to the complexity of environmental, climatic and socioeconomic factors affecting climate risk, the multi-sectoral (health, environment, water, transport) impacts and the range of factors affecting interventions at community level. Understanding the specific vulnerabilities of communities at different seasons, and their exposure to different types of climate risk is key to improving physical and livelihood risk assessment, preparedness, communication and response.

The Integrated Database for African Policy-makers (IDAPs; http://www.walker.ac.uk/projects/idaps-integrated-database-for- african-policy-makers/), arose from a review of data sources from Meteorology, Hydrology and Agronomics. And also of Livelihoods data, which indicates at community level how people live: what they grow, what they eat what they buy, what they sell. The dependencies between these different data sources make it clear that if we can connect the &quot;hard sciences&quot; data with the livelihoods data, we can better understand the impact of climate change on the real lives of people.

The core of IDAPs data is the Livelihoods data that is the point where resilience of communities, in the face of climate change, can be measured. Livelihoods data in IDAPS is based on The Household Economy Approach (HEA)1. Around that core data IDAPs integrates data from other sources to provide policy makers and others with actionable insight into how climate change might be expected to affect vulnerable populations in their purview.

IDAPS brings together a dedicated interdisciplinary multi-institutional team of internationally recognized:
? natural scientists
? social scientists
? and knowledge exchange experts,
with an established track record of productive collaboration in Sub-Saharan Africa for research and development towards climate resilient livelihoods and infrastructure. It is jointly led by the Walker Institute and our embedded partners, Evidence for Development.

HOW DOES IDAPS WORK?
IDAPs is a cloud-based database.
 ? It can take data feeds from other databases and data sources.
? It can provide extracts to other databases.
? It provides an application for the collection of
livelihoods data.
? It has pre-built analytics and analytic tooling for custom
analysis.","Webtool/Application","","2020","IDAPS provides policy makers and others with actionable insight into how climate change might be expected to affect vulnerable populations in their purview. Whilst too early to link to direct impact, we expect to see this in 2020/21 as IDAPS is rolled out to provide government-led scenario planning in Uganda. It will also be linked into the RAINWATCH (www.rainwatch-africa.org) platform operating across 15 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to support National Adaptation Planning for different sectors.","http://www.walker.ac.uk/research/projects/idaps-integrated-database-for-african-policy-makers/","5e668334c4e980.16616553","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5e668334c4e980.16616553&grantRef=NE%2FM020371%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M020371/1","2D26B0A8-842F-444B-A989-7C31ED42F1E6","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","E89C3602-0FB4-4044-A918-58966B8A10B2","8052BB87-7123-4292-9517-F284DD425B3E"

It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations involved.

Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard format for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.
SEEK is incorporating semantic technology allowing sophisticated queries over the data, yet without getting in the way of your users.","Software","Yes","2009","The SEEK4Science platform was adopted by the all of the ERANet SysMO I and II projects it was designed for and has gone on to be widely adopted in other programmes, notably the German Virtual Liver Network and its follow-on Liver Systems Medicine project, ERANet's ERASysBio+ projects, and ERASysAPP. 
The Platform is now developed under the FAIRDOM Initiative (funded by the DMMCore project partners, including the BBSRC) http://www.fair-dom.org, were it has been rebadged as FAIRDOM-SEEK

The software platform has been independently adopted by 50+ groups in Europe, Russia, South Africa, USA, and the UK. EU Projects that adopt the platform include: EmPowerPutida and Mycosynvac; national projects include the German Systems Medicine for Liver project and the de.NBI German Bioinformatics Network, and the Norway's Digital Life programme. The platform has been adopted by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory a large national scientific user facility at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, USA. Combined with the openBIS system, it is the platform for two UK Synthetic Biology Centre's data management (SynBioChem and SynthSys). 

90+ projects are currently registered on FAIRDOMHub.org Commons, a centralised public community instance of the SEEK4Science Platform. 
Work on the SysMO-DB project and the SEEK directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE Light - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe, and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area. 

The SEEK4Science software and associated software, FAIRDOMHub Commons and its support services form a core pillar of the ISBE Light Interim phase. 

Commercially, SEEK was the prototype component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's eaglecore platform, adopted by GeneXplain and is currently being reviewed by 3 commercial organisations.

Practical evaluation of SEEK and openBIS for biological data management in SynthSys; first report (https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/12236) recommended the platform.

The SysMO-DB project also directly lead to the DMMCore award (renamed the FAIRDOM project), a consortium of 4 EU funding councils to: Establish a sustainable European Infrastructure to extend the network services to the wider European systems biology community; Develop the necessary toolset and set up a data and model management platform for systems biology project, building on SEEK and openBIS (SystemsX); and document and disseminate the outcomes and activities to funding agencies, projects and centres with the goal of establishing a sustainable business model for this infrastructure.

It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations involved.

Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard format for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.
SEEK is incorporating semantic technology allowing sophisticated queries over the data, yet without getting in the way of your users.","Software","Yes","2009","The SEEK4Science platform was adopted by the all of the ERANet SysMO I and II projects it was designed for and has gone on to be widely adopted in other programmes, notably the German Virtual Liver Network and its follow-on Liver Systems Medicine project, ERANet's ERASysBio+ projects, and ERASysAPP. 
The Platform is now developed under the FAIRDOM Initiative (funded by the DMMCore project partners, including the BBSRC) http://www.fair-dom.org, were it has been rebadged as FAIRDOM-SEEK

The software platform has been independently adopted by 50+ groups in Europe, Russia, South Africa, USA, and the UK. EU Projects that adopt the platform include: EmPowerPutida and Mycosynvac; national projects include the German Systems Medicine for Liver project and the de.NBI German Bioinformatics Network, and the Norway's Digital Life programme. The platform has been adopted by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory a large national scientific user facility at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, USA. Combined with the openBIS system, it is the platform for two UK Synthetic Biology Centre's data management (SynBioChem and SynthSys). 

90+ projects are currently registered on FAIRDOMHub.org Commons, a centralised public community instance of the SEEK4Science Platform. 
Work on the SysMO-DB project and the SEEK directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE Light - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe, and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area. 

The SEEK4Science software and associated software, FAIRDOMHub Commons and its support services form a core pillar of the ISBE Light Interim phase. 

Commercially, SEEK was the prototype component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's eaglecore platform, adopted by GeneXplain and is currently being reviewed by 3 commercial organisations.

Practical evaluation of SEEK and openBIS for biological data management in SynthSys; first report (https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/12236) recommended the platform.

The SysMO-DB project also directly lead to the DMMCore award (renamed the FAIRDOM project), a consortium of 4 EU funding councils to: Establish a sustainable European Infrastructure to extend the network services to the wider European systems biology community; Develop the necessary toolset and set up a data and model management platform for systems biology project, building on SEEK and openBIS (SystemsX); and document and disseminate the outcomes and activities to funding agencies, projects and centres with the goal of establishing a sustainable business model for this infrastructure.

<strong>Overview</strong> Source code and input data for v1.0 of the Dynamic Anthropogenic activitieS impacting Heat emissions model. DASH considers both urban form and function in simulating QF by use of an agent-based structure that includes behavioural characteristics of city populations. This allows social practices to drive the calculation of QF as occupants move, varying by day type, demographic, location, activity, socio-economic factors and in response to environmental conditions. DASH has simple transport and building energy models to allow simulation of dynamic vehicle use, occupancy and heating/cooling demand, with subsequent release of energy to the outdoor environment through the building fabric. The entire model comprises two parts: 1. Agent interaction (under 2.movementtravel) 2. Agent reaction (under.energyQfcalcs README files can be found in each folder with quick start guides for each.

<strong>Overview</strong> Source code and input data for v1.0 of the Dynamic Anthropogenic activitieS impacting Heat emissions model. DASH considers both urban form and function in simulating QF by use of an agent-based structure that includes behavioural characteristics of city populations. This allows social practices to drive the calculation of QF as occupants move, varying by day type, demographic, location, activity, socio-economic factors and in response to environmental conditions. DASH has simple transport and building energy models to allow simulation of dynamic vehicle use, occupancy and heating/cooling demand, with subsequent release of energy to the outdoor environment through the building fabric. The entire model comprises two parts: 1. Agent interaction (under 2.movementtravel) 2. Agent reaction (under.energyQfcalcs README files can be found in each folder with quick start guides for each.

An Environmental Zone is a region of broadly similar environmental characteristics and is used here to control for non-biological factors that affect biodiversity (e.g. geology and climate).","Webtool/Application","","2015","Enables simple access to simple summary information built on citizen science.","https://eip.ceh.ac.uk/apps/ecostatus/","56e1424757a309.29380286","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56e1424757a309.29380286&grantRef=ceh020003","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ceh020003","69AAF37F-89D6-4E83-96E3-F6EDFA0B2CEC","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4FC881BE-799E-459C-A287-2A68170426DA","3677BAA5-7975-4F5B-931D-388BA2A423E1"

geodynamic problems with chemical heterogeneity. However, velocity interpolation from grid points to particle
locations is often performed without considering the divergence of the velocity field, which can lead to
significant particle dispersion or clustering if those particles move through regions of strong velocity gradients.
This may ultimately result in cells void of particles, which, if left untreated, may, in turn, lead to
numerical inaccuracies. Here we apply a two-dimensional conservative velocity interpolation (CVI) scheme
to steady state and time-dependent flow fields with strong velocity gradients (e.g., due to large local viscosity
variation) and derive and apply the three-dimensional equivalent.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2015","We show that the introduction of CVI
significantly reduces the dispersion and clustering of particles in both steady state and time-dependent
flow problems and maintains a locally steady number of particles, without the need for ad hoc remedies
such as very high initial particle densities or reseeding during the calculation. We illustrate that this method
provides a significant improvement to particle distributions in common geodynamic modeling problems
such as subduction zones or lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary dynamics.","https://www.dur.ac.uk/earth.sciences/staff/academic/?mode=pdetail&id=4586&sid=4586&pdetail=99973","5c83e417a294d2.99540327","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5c83e417a294d2.99540327&grantRef=NE%2FJ008028%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/J008028/1","70C126F1-E803-4C01-9E1F-C20455EE7A50","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","46B41008-0EB4-4E28-BBFB-E98366999EC5","D0494816-983D-40EF-80D6-98C5FEFAD642"

Using statistical approaches, it has shown that a web application can link and analyse different datasets in an accurate, rigorous and user-friendly manner. Bringing together Met Office data on climate variables, daily ozone measurements and ONS Mortality data for London over a 5 year period, the project initially sought to replicate research that linked temperature, air quality, and death rates using time series regression analysis.

The approach was to have user-friendly input screens to guide the user through the process, so they can perform their analysis without the necessary technical skills of some statistical software packages (ie Stata). Having successfully replicated the research, the browser was extended to incorporate additional datasets such as pollen and daily emergency hospital admissions data - demonstrating how the application could be readily adapted to combine datasets from different sources and give users the ability to explore new hypotheses (additional data is available through the full version of the app).

The application is built on open source technologies including PostgreSql database and the Python web framework Django. PostgreSql was used as it has advanced spatial libraries, which would allow for the application to be developed further to include spatial analysis. Python includes a number of statistical packages which we could leverage, as well as being able to run in a web application using Django.

The client is built using Bootstrap and Angularjs to allow for a user-friendly responsive graphical user interface with visualizations such as charts.","Webtool/Application","","2015","It has demonstrated the ability to develop and use a web-browser as an alternative to statistical packages, as a way of linking environmental and health data.

Through this blockchain-based app, it allows users to donate money directly to charitable causes with a number of conditions attached upheld with the use of smart contracts.

For example a contract may look like this,

I will donate &pound;100 to an earthquake response fund which will be released if there is a significant earthquake anywhere in the world in the next 12 months. After 12 months, if there has not been an earthquake, then the donor has a number of options;

To withdraw their donation and keep their money
To donate directly to the charity's general unrestricted funds
To renew or create a new contract with the same charity through the app
To create a new contract with a different charity through the app
By working with a number of charitable partners, we are exploring the opportunities and challenges presented by this new approach to giving.","Webtool/Application","","2020","Based on initial fieldwork and our partnership with Oxfam Australia, we ran a real-world trial of the Smart Donations platform from October to December 2019. We deployed Smart Donations as an Android and iOS mobile app with 86 participants, for up to 8 weeks. Our pilot was highly exploratory. We sought to test the platform, and identify strong use cases and applications from real users and charitable donors. Participants were given limited funds to pledge as they saw fit, to five campaigns that were co-constructed with Oxfam Australia, and leveraging different data sources and conditions.
Earthquake Insurance allowed donors to pledge to donate whenever earthquakes of a specific magnitude and location were detected around the world. Keep Families Together invited donors to donate whenever a petition for government action on refugees was signed by others. Shine a Light on Refugees explored relating giving to politicians and activists discourse on Twitter about topics related to refugees. Fight Climate Change asked donors to pledge funds for climate change projects, whenever extreme temperatures were reached in Australian cities. And the Cyclone Protector contract responded to the emergence and threat of Pacific cyclones - as these were detected, funds could be pledged for disaster response and resilience.
During our short trial, we recorded how donors used the app, collected survey responses and interviewed a number of participants about their experiences. Our analysis of this data is still ongoing, but there are already some key findings. The app produced highly novel and compelling experiences for many donors, but also provided mixed emotions. Contracts were signed with anticipation and excitement, but then when they were triggered and funds were released at unexpected moments, participants reflected on why they were giving, and if this was the right time and the right way to support causes they cared about.
Our participants engaged with the app frequently, and across daily rhythms, often in between other activities as they were notified when their conditions have been met or were expired which meant their money was returned. Some envisaged Smart Donations as an investment platform, where priorities for donations could be set and forgotten, and then pledged funds would be automatically allocated over the course of the year. Others sought and enjoyed frequent engagement with even small donations, and valued an ongoing awareness of world events, and a sense of immediately responding to these events. These experiences were mediated by the conditions, triggers and Smart Donations themselves - with some triggering very frequently, while others were much slower and less active. It's therefore crucial that charities are able to understand, calibrate and communicate clearly to donors how different donations and contracts may play out over time. The pilot in 2019 was the first real world exploration of a data-driven donation framework that leverages emerging blockchain technology and smart contract capabilities to support real-time, automated conditional donations. The Smart Donation pilot in 2019 was the first real-world exploration of a data-driven donation framework that leverages emerging blockchain technology and smart contract capabilities to support automated conditional giving. Through our research, we aim to gain a better understanding of the challenges, stakeholder's expectations and the technical requirements of such systems in particular. More broadly, our work explores the opportunities and implications of situating blockchain and data-driven technologies situated in the space of international aid and opens new directions for future research.","https://smart-donations.oxchain.uk","6228b69d1a7058.89226437","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=6228b69d1a7058.89226437&grantRef=EP%2FN028198%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N028198/1","3185E56D-29F0-4D43-B965-F2B9B1895C45","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","ADDE3750-CED3-4CA4-A303-BAD32A0C4A82"

This allows the thresholds for the amount of change needed to trigger capture to be set to avoid false positives when, e.g. a majority of the image changes (e.g. due to a change of lighting) or when only a small fraction varies (e.g. when a leaf blows in the wind).

There are two versions of the camera. The standard one is designed to be used in daylight, while an infrared version uses a different camera and is equipped with infrared lights connected by long leads, allowing different lighting effects to be achieved.

My Naturewatch Camera creates its own wifi network, allowing it to be controlled from a phone, tablet or laptop using a custom web interface. Images are stored on an internal SD card but can also be downloaded via wifi. This makes using the camera considerably more convenient than most camera traps, which only show images on screens inside the case (and thus inaccessible on set up) and storing them on SD cards which must be removed for download.

The camera is designed to be open-source and is intended to be accessible to a wide variety of people to make in their local settings. Based on a Raspberry Pi microprocessor platform, it can be constructed entirely from off-the-shelf parts following instructions on www.mynaturewatch.net and using software available on the site.

My Naturewatch Cameras are designed to be housed using household materials modified by their makers. For instance, a case can be constructed by drilling a hole in a Tupperware container for the lens to go through, and then mounting half a plastic bottle to serve as a weather shield. The intention is for the camera to be accessible to a wide range of publics to make at home, or in schools, maker spaces or wildlife reserves.","Physical Model/Kit","","2018","My Naturewatch Cameras have been deployed to a number of volunteer users at events staged in Wildlife Centres and schools (see 'Engagement Activities'.

However, a major shortcoming of the Red List is that most of the world's described species have not yet been assessed and published on the Red List (Bachman et al. 2019Eisenhauer et al. 2019). Conservation efforts can be better supported if the Red List is expanded to achieve greater coverage of mega-diverse groups of organisms such as plants, fungi and invertebrates. There is, therefore, an urgent need to speed up the Red List assessment and documentation workflow.One reason for this lack of species coverage is that a manual and relatively time-consuming procedure is usually employed to assess and document species. A recent update of Red List documentation standards (IUCN 2013) reduced the data requirements for publishing non-threatened or 'Least Concern' species on the Red List. The majority of the required fields for Least Concern plant species can be found in existing open-access data sources or can be easily calculated. There is an opportunity to consolidate these data and analyses into a simple application to fast-track the publication of Least Concern assessments for plants. There could be as many as 250,000 species of plants (60%) likely to be categorised as Least Concern (Bachman et al. 2019), for which automatically generated assessments could considerably reduce the outlay of time and valuable resources for Red Listing, allowing attention and resources to be dedicated to the assessment of those species most likely to be threatened.","Webtool/Application","Yes","2020","Only just release to too early to report.","https://spbachman.shinyapps.io/rapidLC/","5e5ec79a6d10b9.50041524","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5e5ec79a6d10b9.50041524&grantRef=NE%2FL013045%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L013045/1","7F1AA68D-215E-4DE3-9F05-1FDBFB0AB674","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","52BA26D6-F923-4324-BCB4-8FF9F32A2311","C1988D60-8EAE-49AD-85C8-9FD2993DD09E"

The HUMA App helped create and deploy a new 12-week intensification of care service, &quot;Fresh Start&quot;, for patients with Type 2 Diabetes. The App enabled Virtual Group Consultations with peers and health care professionals and a structured education campaign. All delivered to the patient in their own home.

The mismatch between the energy generated by the harvesters and the energy demanded by the WSNs is always a bottleneck as the ambient environmental energy is limited and time-varying. This paper introduces a combined energy-aware interface (EAI) with an energy-aware program to deal with the mismatch through managing the energy flow from the energy storage capacitor to the WSNs. These two energy-aware approaches were implemented in a custom developed vibration energy harvesting powered WSN. The experimental results show that, with the 3.2 mW power generated by a piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) under an emulated aircraft wing strain loading of 600 µe at 10 Hz, the combined energy-aware approaches enable the WSN to have a significantly reduced sleep current from 28.3 &micro;A of a commercial WSN to 0.95 &micro;A and enable the WSN operations for a long active time of about 1.15 s in every 7.79 s to sample and transmit a large number of data (388 bytes), rather than a few ten milliseconds and a few bytes, as demanded by vibration measurement. When the approach was not used, the same amount of energy harvested was not able to power the WSN to start, not mentioning to enabling the WSN operation, which highlighted the importance and the value of the energy-aware approaches in enabling energy harvesting powered WSN operation successfully.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2015","Published in IEEE Sensors Journal 2017",,"58a2fb96592fc4.90739780","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=58a2fb96592fc4.90739780&grantRef=EP%2FK017950%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K017950/1","65464E92-E6C0-421A-97B9-58DD4ED538D1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","F45A4578-F962-4EFA-9CC1-9F2FF4F760AE","55FEC4DB-A38A-4BD8-BE2B-84291AAE18EF"

It operates as a freely available web-based interface to guide decision-making with respect to diffuse microbial pollution risk assessment. Its purpose is to demonstrate variability in spatial and temporal FIO source risks on agricultural land in order to inform more effective land management to reduce diffuse microbial pollution from livestock farming.

ViPER enables user engagement on three levels: 1) as a demonstration farm environment; 2) as a quick FIO calculator; and 3) as a fully functional spatial &amp; temporal FIO risk mapping tool.","Webtool/Application","","2015","The impact from the project will mature over time and will be enhanced with additional modifications of the ViPER toolkit as it develops into a beta stage of release. The impact thus far has been in bringing the different end-user communities together to agree on a structure for a decision-support-tool to inform on diffuse microbial pollution.

The ViPER calculator mode provides a useful tool and allows user defined scenarios, which was welcomed and does provide immediate impact in terms of on-farm advice that can be provided. No participants were aware of a freely-available product that provides information of temporal patterns of E. coli accumulation on pasture as governed by faecal excretion and E. coli die-off.

The most significant impact will arise once the final remaining bugs are fixed, and final modifications implemented, in turn allowing for a wider roll out of the ViPER platform to farm advisors, perhaps most notably the Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Team. They acknowledge that a number of their priority catchments in England have FIO pollution issues and that ViPER could help develop farmer understanding.","http://www.nercviper.co.uk","56b0ea4abf5368.09737791","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=56b0ea4abf5368.09737791&grantRef=NE%2FM007812%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M007812/1","37B75D83-C212-454F-922D-E36A4FEE3527","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","C7510606-A36F-4725-A89B-9D592374972A","2144697F-87D1-40EC-B086-746ADABD3BE4"

Such large phylogenies are useful for macroevolutionary studies, comparative biology and in conservation and biodiversity. No easy to use and fully integrated software package currently exists to carry out this task. Here, we present a new Python-based software package that uses well defined XML schema to manage both data and metadata. It builds on previous versions by 1) including new processing steps, such as Safe Taxonomic Reduction, 2) using a user-friendly GUI that guides the user to complete at least the minimum information required and includes context-sensitive documentation, and 3) a revised storage format that integrates both tree- and meta-data into a single file. These data can then be manipulated according to a well-defined, but flexible, processing pipeline using either the GUI or a command-line based tool. Processingsteps include standardising names, deleting or replacing taxa, ensuring adequate taxonomic overlap, ensuring data independence, and safe taxonomic reduction. This software has been successfully used to store and process data consisting of over 1000 trees ready for analyses using standard supertree methods. This software makes large supertree creation a much easier task and provides far greater flexibility for further work.","Webtool/Application","","2014","The software is new, but has already been used by 10 final year undergraduates in their projects.","http://supertreetoolkit.org/","54525051e59a69.53227133","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54525051e59a69.53227133&grantRef=BB%2FK006754%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/K006754/1","86515EE3-DF65-4B74-8D8F-877115867172","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","EAAD4D43-BD15-432B-9385-2DBD0C65958D","3B9820FD-AF90-40AD-B0DC-FDD25F5F8486"

Users can search words and phrases across a single book or a range of texts of the CLiC corpora. CLiC makes it possible to focus searches (also key comparisons or the retrieval of clusters) on 'quotes', i.e. text within quotation marks, 'non-quotes', i.e. text outside of quotation marks, and 'suspensions', i.e. stretches of narrator text that interrupt the speech of a fictional character. The release of CLiC 1.6 contains significant updates of and changes to the web app. 

The new release of CLiC contains a range of additional features, a new look and a completely reworked back-end database to ensure sustainability. As a result of these changes CLiC is now based on a unified PostgreSQL database for all content, a widely used open source database management system. CLiC has also been upgraded to Python 3, which makes it sustainable for the coming years.

Changes to the features include:

* An interactive overview of the corpora has been created in the new Counts tab, which allows users to check the compositions of the corpora.
* Users can now easily select all books from an author to create their own specialized corpus and quickly swap the &quot;Target&quot; and &quot;Reference&quot; corpora in the Keywords tab. These changes were inspired by user feedback from workshops.
* A new distribution plot view has been added to the Concordance tab.
* The new &quot;Text&quot; tab shows the full text of individual books and allows you to navigate to particular chapters. Most importantly, the text can now be easily copied and pasted into Microsoft Word documents. Users can also select the levels of annotation they want to display.
* In response to user requests, we have added 7 new texts to the ArTs corpus: Charlotte Bront&euml;'s &quot;Villette&quot; and &quot;Shirley&quot;, H. G. Wells's &quot;Time Machine&quot; and some of Dickens's nonfiction (&quot;American Notes&quot;, &quot;Pictures from Italy&quot;, &quot;The Uncommercial Traveller&quot; and &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot;).
* In response to a collaboration request by Nicholas J. Rosato and Claiborne Rice of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, USA, in 2019, we worked with the US team to guide them in editing the texts and then released these texts as the new corpus of African American Writers 1892-1912 with CLiC version 2.0.3 in October 2019.

As of Feb 2021, CLiC is at version 2.1.2","Webtool/Application","Yes","2019","Even before the official release of CLiC 2.0 on 7 March 2019 we had already received very positive feedback from our test users. Several researchers have welcomed the addition of Dickens's non-fiction texts and indicated that they will use these in their research projects. Based on our experiences with hands-on workshops, the added features and improvements to the interface will make CLiC easier to use in the classroom.

Update: As of Feb 2021, CLiC has had about 20K users in 100 countries.","http://clic.bham.ac.uk","5c800eda58df08.69754313","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5c800eda58df08.69754313&grantRef=AH%2FK005146%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/K005146/1","E8C530EB-E892-4914-B5C3-42D3ADF19BB6","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","936D002F-A8D1-4A93-AE5D-825ED0903D8D","0205F2F3-8A93-4ACC-912A-731016F75014"

The most visible manifestation of the Energy Babble are the 35 devices that we distributed to participants. These comprise a combination of two custom blown-glass components set on top of an injection-moulded base. The base houses the device's electronic components, including a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, various actuators, and a compact loudspeaker. The central glass piece serves to amplify the output of the speaker located beneath it-glass's acoustic properties make it optimal for this function-while second glass piece supports it and holds a microphone attached to the base by a coiled cable. A prominent yellow knob rotates to control volume; if turned beyond its lowest setting it plays a recorded description of the system and its operation, using the same synthesised voices as the rest of the system.

The audio stream played by the Babble devices is algorithmically constructed and represents the results of a number of modular processes. The first set of these seek new information from the web: 1.1) Twitter Scrape The system scrapes messages from a variety of Twitter™ feeds, including those from the user communities, from DECC, and from the National Grid. 1.2) Twitter Search The system searches Twitter™ using a number of terms (e.g. 'climate change', ''energy bills', 'renewable energy') to find relevant content more broadly. 1.3) URL Following If returned tweets contain 'http' and have been retweeted, the system follows the link and scrapes the first paragraph of text for output. 1.4) Energy Reports The system also tracks the National Grid, broadcasting information about current energy demand and carbon intensity, as well as changes in the amounts of energy generated by coal, gas, and wind. 1.5) Switched Off The reports hourly a list of things people tweet about having switched off (lights, heat, the internet). A second set of modules accepts input from participants, or manipulates the existing content. 2.1) User Input Users can input their own statements via the microphones on the Babble devices. Voice recordings are sent to the server, which passes them to a commercial service for speech-to-text translation, allowing them to be resynthesised both to anonymise inputs and make them congruent with the overall audio ecology. Text can also be entered directly via SMS text messaging. 2.2) Prompt Bot We developed a string of generic questions (e.g. 'how do you save energy?') that were read out occasionally by the system to prompt participant responses. 2.3)The Voice of Babble Markov algorithms are run on the content scraped from URLs, and separately on user inputs, to produce new text strings. Markov algorithms find word transition probabilities from a corpus; these probabilities can be used to generate new strings of words. The results tend to be locally sensible, but drift over time in a way we hoped would produce new ideas or at least be amusing. 
The system orchestrates the content in a variety of ways. For instance user input is played as soon as possible, while energy reports only appear hourly. Different voices are assigned to different streams of content, and content is repeated periodically. Distinct jingles signal different streams of content. Finally, the output stream is arranged to be continuous but uneven, with occasional gaps followed by bursts of several messages.","Physical Model/Kit","","2014","Energy Babbles were deployed to approximately 35 participant households and small businesses (e.g. a pub, a library) in eight 'energy communities' (areas with groups pursuing energy reduction or generation locally) around the UK. Impacts included new sources of energy-related information and possibilities for information exchange with other communities, as well as a heightened sensitivity to information overload. The Babbles have also appeared in seven (to date) exhibitions in the UK, Australia and the US where they have been viewed by thousands of visitors, impacting their understandings of issues related to energy demand reduction, community action and the prospects of technologies in these fields.",,"5aafc975513523.29196395","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5aafc975513523.29196395&grantRef=ES%2FI007318%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/I007318/1","89A03155-E1D9-482E-AFA5-E22862E54053","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","A9B1866C-EE3E-4D81-A83C-118745E9433E","89A56B72-D358-482A-A259-2C1FA4ECC4BE"

Included variables are: heat fluxes (sensible, latent, shortwave radiation, longwave radiation), air temperature, sea surface temperature, wind speed, specific humidity, pressure and cloud cover. The quality of the gridded data is quantified by estimates of random, bias and total uncertainty. The monthly means were derived from daily estimates of each variable and the standard deviation of these daily values is also available. Users are advised to take account of the uncertainty estimates provided, and to note that in very poorly sampled regions, such as the Southern Ocean, the uncertainty estimates themselves may be unreliable.

Users can search words and phrases across a single book or a range of texts of the CLiC corpora. CLiC makes it possible to focus searches (also key comparisons or the retrieval of clusters) on 'quotes', i.e. text within quotation marks, 'non-quotes', i.e. text outside of quotation marks, and 'suspensions', i.e. stretches of narrator text that interrupt the speech of a fictional character. The release of CLiC 1.6 contains significant updates of and changes to the web app. 

The new release of CLiC contains a range of additional features, a new look and a completely reworked back-end database to ensure sustainability. As a result of these changes CLiC is now based on a unified PostgreSQL database for all content, a widely used open source database management system. CLiC has also been upgraded to Python 3, which makes it sustainable for the coming years.

Changes to the features include:

* An interactive overview of the corpora has been created in the new Counts tab, which allows users to check the compositions of the corpora.
* Users can now easily select all books from an author to create their own specialized corpus and quickly swap the &quot;Target&quot; and &quot;Reference&quot; corpora in the Keywords tab. These changes were inspired by user feedback from workshops.
* A new distribution plot view has been added to the Concordance tab.
* The new &quot;Text&quot; tab shows the full text of individual books and allows you to navigate to particular chapters. Most importantly, the text can now be easily copied and pasted into Microsoft Word documents. Users can also select the levels of annotation they want to display.
* In response to user requests, we have added 7 new texts to the ArTs corpus: Charlotte Bront&euml;'s &quot;Villette&quot; and &quot;Shirley&quot;, H. G. Wells's &quot;Time Machine&quot; and some of Dickens's nonfiction (&quot;American Notes&quot;, &quot;Pictures from Italy&quot;, &quot;The Uncommercial Traveller&quot; and &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot;).
* In response to a collaboration request by Nicholas J. Rosato and Claiborne Rice of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, USA, in 2019, we worked with the US team to guide them in editing the texts and then released these texts as the new corpus of African American Writers 1892-1912 with CLiC version 2.0.3 in October 2019.

In the work presented here, a knee-joint energy harvester (KEH) was introduced to power a customer-built wireless communication sensing node (WCSN). The KEH used a mechanical plucking technique to provide sufficient frequency up-conversion - from a few Hz to the resonant frequency of the KEH - so as to generate the high power required. It was actuated by a knee-joint simulator, which reproduced the knee-joint motion of human gaits at a walking frequency of 0.9 Hz. The energy generated was first stored in a reservoir capacitor and then released to the WCSN in a burst mode with the help of an energy aware interface (EAI). The WCSN was deployed with a 3-axis accelerometer, a temperature sensor, and a light detector for data sensing. A Jennic microcontroller was utilised to collect and transmit the measured data to a base station placed at a distance of 12 m. The energy generation by the KEH and the energy distribution in the system was characterised in real time by an in-house-built set-up. The results showed that the KEH generated an average power output of 1.76 mW when powering the WCSN. After charging the reservoir capacitor for 28.4 s, the KEH can power the WCSN for a 46 ms period every 1.25 s. The results also clearly illustrated how the energy generated by the KEH was distributed in the system and highlighted the importance of using a high performance power management approach to improve the performance of the whole system.","Systems, Materials & Instrumental Engineering","","2015","Published In Smart Materials and Structures",,"58a2fc9c78a632.16728209","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=58a2fc9c78a632.16728209&grantRef=EP%2FK017950%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K017950/1","65464E92-E6C0-421A-97B9-58DD4ED538D1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","F45A4578-F962-4EFA-9CC1-9F2FF4F760AE","55FEC4DB-A38A-4BD8-BE2B-84291AAE18EF"

It takes regional economic conditions such as demand for agricultural commodities, technological development and production costs as well as spatially explicit data on potential crop yields, land and water constraints (from LPJmL) into account. Based on these, the model derives specific land use patterns, yields and total costs of agricultural production for each grid cell. The objective function of the land use model is to minimize total cost of production for a given amount of regional food and bioenergy demand.

Longbow handles jobs setup in terms of creating job submission scripts, automatically stages input files, launches and monitors jobs and stages back simulation results. The option is also there to persistently monitor and stage (realtime local syncing with remote simulation files) simulation files at a specified time interval. This is designed to have the jobs running on the HPC remote resource appear to the user as if the simulation has run on their local computer/cluster. Users do not have to concern themselves with writing submission files, nor do they have to worry about staging.

This version was a major new release which focused on addressing a number of architectural problems, this required major refactoring of the code base. In this release a move to continuous integration by making use of cloud services such as Travis (Testing), Landscape (Quality) and Coveralls (Coverage) was performed, this required writing of more than 600 unit tests based on the code refactors done on this version. The shift towards continuous integration should help to improve the quality of the software, help make development more collaborative, and also increase sustainability.

The extrusion profile tools used in this process are commonly known as dies. This invention facilitates extrusion dies to be integrated with coating capabilities for both the external surfaces as well as internal cavities of extruded profiles. 

This invention enables the facility of applying a coating as an integrated part of extrusion process - particular in with the use of ceramic pastes. The invention has the capacity to use coatings to improve the functional performance of the products such as enhanced capacities of extruded pipes to carry liquids, improved structural integrity - or facilitate weather resistance of products intended for external use. This facility also enables aesthetic transformations of products produced in a single standard body through the application of coloured coatings, which has significant commercial potential.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2021","The impact of this innovation is still to be realised but it is likely to have commercial impact through innovation in industries that already utilize profile extrusion by extending the existing capacities manufacturing capabilities of these industries. The invention also has the potential to enable entirely new and novel uses of ceramics in sectors not currently utilising ceramic profile extrusion. Sectors identified where this invention has relevance include aerospace, energy and low carbon construction.

To unlock this potential researchers from around the world investigate associations between the retina and conditions such as hypertension, kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dementia. However, this requires access to specialist software that will measures retinal images in an accurate and reliable way. We possess this expertise and the software through our successful VAMPIRE project. We propose delivering these computerised measurements through a web-based App, enabling our software to be utilised by many more researchers than we are currently able to reach. By charging for access we will sustain and grow the facility, especially as empowering present research will very likely see future activity involving drug development (with the retina as a source of outcome measures to assess efficacy) and large-scale population screening programmes to identify at-risk individuals for more effective interventions.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2017","As a result of the project, significant improvements have been made to the analysis of retinal images, including: 
1. Enhanced human-computer interface, which is more efficient and gives a better user experience. 
2. Robust handling of images from different devices with different resolutions 
3. Superior measurement processes with more reliable outputs 
4. Scalability - i.e. can handle more users and more images than ever before 5.

Finding novel approaches to coordinate the movements of a fleet of aircraft at an airport in order to improve system resilience to disruptions with increasing autonomy is at the center of many key studies for airport airside operations. Moreover, autonomous taxiing is envisioned as a key component in future digitalized airports. However, state-of-the-art routing and scheduling algorithms for airport ground movements do not consider high-fidelity aircraft models at both the proactive and reactive planning phases. The majority of such algorithms do not actively seek to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. We proposed a new approach for generating efficient four-dimensional trajectories (4DTs) on the basis of a high-fidelity aircraft model and gain-scheduling control strategy. Working in conjunction with a routing and scheduling algorithm that determines the taxi route, waypoints, and time deadlines, the proposed approach generates fuel-efficient 4DTs in real time, while respecting operational constraints.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2021","The proposed approach can be used in two contexts: ? as a reactive decision support tool to generate new trajectories that can resolve unprecedented events; and ? as an autopilot system for both partial and fully autonomous taxiing. The proposed methodology is realistic and simple to implement. Moreover, simulation studies show that the proposed approach is capable of providing an up to 11% reduction in the fuel consumed during the taxiing of a large Boeing 747-100 jumbo jet.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809921000874","622b20c1208580.55457145","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=622b20c1208580.55457145&grantRef=EP%2FN029496%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N029496/2","9919DF67-E136-46D8-B2A7-95B048CCD4A3","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","30948BD9-306B-4DE3-B668-EE0A24604BFC"

To better assess bat population trends there is a critical need for accurate, reliable, and open source tools that allow the detection and classification of bat calls in large collections of audio recordings. The majority of existing tools are commercial or have focused on the species classification task, neglecting the important problem of first localizing echolocation calls in audio which is particularly problematic in noisy recordings. We developed a convolutional neural network based open-source pipeline for detecting ultrasonic, full-spectrum, search-phase calls produced by echolocating bats. Our deep learning algorithms were trained on full-spectrum ultrasonic audio collected along road-transects across Europe and labelled by citizen scientists from www.batdetective.org. When compared to other existing algorithms and commercial systems, we show significantly higher detection performance of search-phase echolocation calls with our test sets. As an example application, we ran our detection pipeline on bat monitoring data collected over five years from Jersey (UK), and compared results to a widely-used commercial system. Our detection pipeline can be used for the automatic detection and monitoring of bat populations, and further facilitates their use as indicator species on a large scale. Our proposed pipeline makes only a small number of bat specific design decisions, and with appropriate training data it could be applied to detecting other species in audio. A crucial novelty of our work is showing that with careful, non-trivial, design and implementation considerations, state-of-the-art deep learning methods can be used for accurate and efficient monitoring in audio.","http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005995","5aa8520b4b7291.24298613","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5aa8520b4b7291.24298613&grantRef=NE%2FP016677%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/P016677/1","4E5F6D54-AC3B-43FA-B569-BD5C4EE1B477","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","A0957E9A-8F03-4853-9846-510D5C21CA5B"

Python Energy and Networks Engine (pyEnergy) has been developed solely through the programme. pyEnergy is a python based mathematical programming simulation model that optimises electricity use in light of (i) economic and environmental criteria, (ii) integration of hydropower as well as intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar, (iii) technical constraints imposed by the energy and water networks (e.g., losses, thermal limits and hydraulic routing) and (iv) customisable spatial and temporal resolution (e.g., for local and multi-country studies). pyEnergy is being developed as an open source model (does not require software licenses) and is currently available, upon request, to FutureDAMS partners and stakeholders. The model is fully compatible with existing open source engines, e.g., pynsim and pywr, facilitating applications to electricity systems, as well as integrated water-energy-food-environment systems.

It builds upon and significantly improves prior research and work of the PI. The platform is comprised by the following:
1) On the front-end: Progressive Web App (PWA) with Image Recognition enabling the visitors of a museum to capture, recognise and create personalised products with the museum's artworks. Products include prints, framed prints and merchandise items.
2) On the back-end: Series of services that perform all necessary activities for the front-end app to perform optimally, including artwork recognition and product design on-runtime.
3) Database: Database of artwork images and meta-data including also image features (i.e. information that is used for image recognition).","e-Business Platform","","2020","With the fellowship project due for completion in September and the experiments moved to June, IMS is still under development. The main impact IMS is seeking to make is to help museums and galleries in the UK address one of their greatest challenges, i.e. to sustain funding. IMS utilises emerging technologies to open up new revenue streams for museums through the sale of personalised, on-demand merchandising that allows them to capture a share of the 25 Billion art merchandise market (Bradshaw 2011). 

An indication of its potential impact is that the project has attracted interest during the COVID-19 pandemic (despite being in its current format an application designed for museum visitors on-site), earning:
(a) a new industry and a new museum partner for the AHRC Fellowship Extension project, which aims to adapt the platform to the post-COVID-19 era
(b) a HEIF grant award to help museums benefit through the platform.

The original LIFE construction was built with calcium silicate board. This material proved unable to withstand the temperatures of the sizes of fire necessary to achieve under-ventilation. For this reason the original walls were replaced with fire-grade masonry and the new walls were topped with a steel roof (with insulation). 

2. Data suggested that the airflow into the apparatus was being over-measured. Detailed investigation showed that the air movement through the inlet channel did not approximate plug flow. The air inlet channel was redesigned and fitted with new, better performing, instrumentation. The new instrumentation was characterised using a wind tunnel.

3. It proved difficult to achieve under-ventilated combustion in the early version of the apparatus due to extra air reaching the combustion chamber by leaking in through the outlet channel. The outlet channel was reconstructed with a ceramic fibre restriction in order to restrict the counterflow of effluent.

4. It was found that the temperature measurements taken in the enclosure did not describe the combustion conditions adequately. A new thermocouple tree was placed in the interface between the room and corridor. This extra data allows the interface between the upper and lower layers to be understood more definitely.

5. It has been found that the original gas analysers sustain damage when operated under negative pressure. The analysers have been modified to work under positive pressure.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2012","The LIFE facility was improved and completely rebuilt which allowed further, more complex, tests to be carried out.",,"r-4801237215.1028716fd22d70","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=r-4801237215.1028716fd22d70&grantRef=EP%2FI033181%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I033181/1","734CA8BE-AA92-48E4-A0B4-EBC9AAA1B945","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","AEC15D5A-BFD5-4D34-978F-500C126C4FDC","F6E5E792-B3EC-48E5-AB10-5FB56C5D33A8"

Multispectral filter arrays (MSFAs) are filter mosaics integrated atop image sensors that facilitate cost-effective, compact, snapshot multispectral imaging. MSFAs are pre-configured based on application-where filter channels are selected corresponding to targeted absorption spectra-making the design of optimal MSFAs vital for a given application. Despite the availability of many design and optimization approaches for spectral channel selection and spatial arrangement, major limitations remain. There are few robust approaches for joint spectral-spatial optimization, techniques are typically only applicable to limited datasets and most critically, are not available for general use and improvement by the wider community. Here, we reconcile current MSFA design techniques and present Opti-MSFA: a Python-based open-access toolbox for the centralized design and optimization of MSFAs. Opti-MSFA incorporates established spectral-spatial optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent and simulated annealing, multispectral-RGB image reconstruction, and is applicable to user-defined input of spatial-spectral datasets or imagery. We demonstrate the utility of the toolbox by comparing against other published MSFAs using the standard hyperspectral datasets Samson and Jasper Ridge, and further show application on experimentally acquired fluorescence imaging data. In conjunction with end-user input and collaboration, we foresee the continued development of Opti-MSFA for the benefit of the wider research community.","Software","Yes","2022","none yet","https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-30-5-7591&id=469746","621a4a262d32d8.62608508","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=621a4a262d32d8.62608508&grantRef=EP%2FR003599%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/R003599/1","1E0883E1-BD8D-45A6-B61F-558118F40522","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","EECB00E7-682C-4C91-B00B-0FFBBEC636C6"

The processing servers are used for converting EO data we receive directly from satellites into environmental science products in near real-time. They have significantly improved our capability to do this so that products are available to our users and NEODAAS partners shortly after data have been received from the satellites. This is critical for users with near-real time data requirements such as marine research cruises, research aircraft flights and assessing weather conditions. It is also significant because new satellites are producing higher volumes of data than before which requires increased processing power.

Taken together, research software, alongside data, facilities, equipment and an overarching research question can be viewed as a research activity or experiment, worthy to be published. Conversely, a publication can be considered as a narrative that describes how the research objects are used together to reply to the research question.

Depositing research software into a digital repository can offer significant benefits. By depositing not just papers, but software, and data sets, as well, researchers can store a more complete record of this ecosystem for future use to both the researchers who undertook the research and also the wider research community. Making research software available allows other researchers to inspect, replicate, reproduce and reuse the research, as manifested in the software, in the short term and to inspect, for the historical record, in the long term. It allows research software to remain available beyond the lifetime of any current project, or a researcher's current employment at a specific institution. Digital repositories can also provide unique persistent digital identifiers for software which can be cited and help researchers to get attribution and credit for their research software when it is used by others.

The Software Sustainability Institute, funded by Jisc, developed a set of complementary guides covering the main aspects of depositing software into digital repositories. These guides are intended for researchers, principal investigators and research leaders and research data and digital repository managers.

Approach: Soft systems methodology was used to develop the app and recommendations in the user experience literature will be used to design the visual interfaces. The app comprised of: (1) a demo version for employees and employers which will show how the input provided by the users will be used to visualise productivity, impact of business strategies and green practices and how the responses can be interpreted by the users; (2) employee version, which will help employees to monitor their own wellbeing and MH; (3) employer version, showing how the existing strategies and practices are affecting both employees' and business productivity, so that they can devise new plans. The survey questions for the app will be drawn from the literature. Achievement badges and progress bars facilitates effective management of individual MH and WB and thus reducing app usage attrition (employee version) and provide an inclusive and implicit way to enhance employee voice. The first version of the app questionnaire, interface design and dashboard visualisations were validated within the selected members of the project team. The second version was validated by conducting focus groups (10SMEs employees and 10 SMEs managers) ants), demonstrating the various features of the app and giving focus group participants the opportunity to use the app in a controlled environment. The final version of the app will was piloted with selected SMEs employees and respective managers following the principles of user acceptance testing (beta testing with target users).","Software","","2021","Deliverables and Impact: The existing MH apps (such as THINK, CALM, WELLSPACE, HAPPIFY) do not monitor workplace well-being issues, rather they are intended to manage MH and facilitate mindfulness, meditation, and instant message conversations with automated chatbots. The attrition rates of such apps or any other monitoring app is around 60% by second week of use, due to limited interactivity, several usability and user-experience issues leading to disengagement. DDSD app is the first app of its kind which will be developed specifically for SMEs' employees and managers (to make data-centric decisions). The app will transform the way SMEs' managers make decisions, implement strategies to create mentally healthy workplace, and at the same time provide an avenue for SMEs' employees to manage their own wellbeing. The app will anonymously monitor the staff MH and WB, organisational strategies, and productivity, supplemented with interactive reports visualised in a dashboard will aid individual SMEs (with information) to customize the strategies in the proposed framework, i.e., automatically evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives implemented to suit the dynamic staff needs in their organisation during and post COVID-19. This will help to enhance the quality of work life for SMEs' staff, which will increase their efficiency and productivity. Therefore, the framework and app is delivered as a package to the SMEs, thus equipping each SME with necessary tools to become agile during this uncertain and difficult economic period (post pandemic) by introducing practices and strategies that will adequately support and train staff, and advise when referral to external support or third sector services are required. 
Impact beyond the project: The app provides a diagnostic tool (at no cost) for the SMEs to identify critical success factors that will enhance the quality of work life for their staff and increase productivity at all fronts (during and post pandemic, and even without pandemic). The tool will not only help SMEs to understand the effectiveness of existing strategies and policies (which is important to enhance productivity), but the consolidated dashboard reports (compiled over time) will help the organisations dynamically evolve these practices, strategies, and policies conducive to the need of their staff, and demonstrate care towards staff welfare and wellbeing. From the perspective of policy makers, the data collected will help them to understand the region-specific SMEs' needs which will lead to better policies and actions based on evidence.

This end-user model has been under development funded through this grant since 2018. It predicts the probability of both ash and soil, and the potential pollutants in them, to be delivered from burned hillslopes into stream channels and waterbodies. WEPPcloud-WATAR is powered by the well-established Water Erosion Prediction Project, WEPP model (Laflen et al. 1997), enhanced with the incorporation of channel hydrology and sediment routing routines (Wang et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2014). Its main advantage over other widely-used erosion models is that it has the capabilities to simulate transport not only of soil, but also of ash and pollutants contained in both, from the hillslopes. These enhanced capabilities provide much more comprehensive probabilistic and spatially distributed predictions of water contamination risk to water assets than other models. The model also automates the acquisition and processing of input data (climate, elevation, soil, and land management information, as well as ash composition) from available datasets, which substantially simplifies its application and reduces the time needed to produce simulations. 
WEPPcloud-WATAR has specific online interfaces for Australia (WEPPcloud-WATAR-AU), the USA (WEPPcloud-WATAR-US), and Europe (WEPPcloud-WATAR-EU)(https://wepp.cloud).","Webtool/Application","","2020","Used to inform major water suppliers (United Utilities-UK; WaterNSW-Australia) about erosion and water contamination risk following major wildfire events.","https://wepp.cloud","603e6854840c46.17870881","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=603e6854840c46.17870881&grantRef=NE%2FR011125%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/R011125/1","D6162EA5-B4C2-4477-A925-EACD045C5F64","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","AB307619-D4FA-427E-A042-09DBEBA84669","79CE56DD-A557-4EDC-A252-CFA6491E62AF"

However, there is no formal, national framework in the UK to record flood severity and consequences and thus benefit an understanding of coastal flooding mechanisms and consequences. To address this issue, we have compiled an innovative new database called 'SurgeWatch' (www.surgewatch.org) to systematic document and improve understanding of coastal flooding. Integrating a variety of 'hard' (e.g. sea level and wave records, meteorological data) and 'soft' (e.g. newspapers, weather reports, and social media) data sources we have identified 330 distinct coastal flooding events from 1915 to 2017 for the UK (and are in the process of adding an additional 400 events pre-1915, extending as far back as 245 AD). We have ranked of each of the 330 flood events using a multi-level categorisation based on inundation, transport disruption, costs, and fatalities: from 1 (Nuisance) to 6 (Disaster). For the most severe events ranked Category 3 and above, an accompanying event description based upon the Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence framework has been produced. To our knowledge SurgeWatch is the most detailed database on coastal flooding anywhere in the world and we hope that similar datasets will be compiled for other countries/regions, following the framework we have developed here.","Webtool/Application","","2015","The database and our accompanying website (www.surgewatch.org) has received considerable attention and positive feedback from scientists, coastal managers and the general public. SurgeWatch was mentioned in a Parliamentary 'debate pack' as part of a briefing to inform MPs ahead of a debate about coastal flood risk held in Westminster on 7th July 2015. We are working with the Environment Agency to implement the database into the UK's forecasting and Warning Service. SurgeWatch has been used in the Cabinet Office's Risk Register to define extreme coastal flood events for the UK.","http://www.surgewatch.org","58c7c71184fbf7.75814387","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=58c7c71184fbf7.75814387&grantRef=EP%2FK013513%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K013513/1","CB3EBDAC-E263-4D0B-A297-930BC089D860","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68","51A34F70-3AFA-4D0E-9595-BBBE78B1CDBD"

This is a piece of software was developed during the work based around CERN's GEANT-IV radiation transport toolkit. The tool has been designed to be flexible enough to allow accurate heating predictions to be made for arbitrary wasteform compositions and waste package shapes.","Software","","2017","It is hoped that the heating tool will find application beyond the current project. To this end work is ongoing to allow its public release. The intention of this is to provide a useful design tool that can help in the optimisation of parameters such as waste-loading and waste package shape and size.

DandeLiion conserves lithium, uses a second-order spatial discretisation method (enabling accurate computations using relatively coarse discretisations) and is hundreds, to many thousands, of times faster than its commercial competitors. It can be used in the 'cloud' and does not require installation before use. Its linear scaling property means that the disparity in performance is even more pronounced for bigger systems, making it particularly suitable for thermally coupled simulations of pouch/cylindrical cells. Currently the basic functionality of DandeLiion is available via a cloud service at http://www.dandeliion.com but more advanced features that have been developed, such as thermally coupled 3-d simulation tools for pouch cells, design tools and an implementation of an energy conservation law will be released behind a pay wall.","Software","","2020","While the basic features of DandeLiion are free to use its more advanced features are being developed as a commercial product.

These were taken under moderate offshore wave energy conditions and varying water levels, and these are presented and analysed to examine the performance of a new portable streamer trap (DIST).

The proposed Depth Integrated Streamer Trap (DIST) is inspired by the design described by Kraus (1987), but avoids errors associated with fitting a vertical distribution to a discrete number of elevations by using a streamer trap mouth big enough to capture all sediment at depths where it is safe to deploy the device (1 m mean water depth). Stability of the device is achieved by gravity (i.e. combined weight of the device and operator) instead of thrusting the legs of the frame into the seabed. The proposed design mitigates some of the known limitations of existing sediment trap devices. Bed disturbance (scour) around the trapping element is minimized by use of a reticulated base that quickly settles into the sea bed. The trap is designed to measure the combined bed load and suspended load sediment transport during short (5-10 min) deployments. The device is heavy enough (46 kg) to provide stability, but can be transported by two people. The trap is easily operated with minimum sample handling in the field. The trap mouth, streamer dimension and mesh size have been made large enough to avoid local acceleration or deceleration of flow, but we have not measured the trap hydraulic resistance and sediment trapping characteristics.

It was designed to help epidemiologists and public health researchers to rapidly investigate potential environmental hazards, especially those related to industrial sites. The tool uses health, environmental, socio-economic, population and geographic data to calculate risks in relation to sources of exposure and to generate maps.","Webtool/Application","","2016","- This past August, the Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF) was successfully demonstrated to funders at the Center for Disease Control. It was later shown to a broader audience of state-level public health monitoring groups in the US at the same event. 
- The meeting in Atlanta provided a means of allowing CDC stake holders to provide feedback on how the RIF would eventually deployed to support their own surveillance activities. They were happy with progress on the project and they outlined some features the tool suite would need for it to be adapted to a US context.
- The RIF is not just one software tool, but a suite of related applications which manage different aspects of supporting disease mapping and risk analysis studies. Among the tools is a highly interactive, graphical tool that epidemiologists could use to specify disease mapping studies. - As well, there is a data loader tool that would allow database administrators a way of cleaning and loading population health data sets and geospatial data sets. 
- The CDC showed particular interest in the data loader tool, which has been designed in a way that may warrant it being used in more generic data loading tasks that are unrelated to its original funded use case.
Both the disease mapping study submission tool and the data loader tool were shown as part of live demonstrations in front of a large audience in the CDC's main conference hall. Among those in attendance were both appreciative users who had used previous versions of the RIF, and supportive people who exhibited a keen interest in having new tools that could save them work doing similar kinds of studies.
- The RIF tool suite continues to garner an widening interest from: Dr. Holowaty, Adjunct Professor from the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto; Frederik Davidsson from the company Geoloc AB in Sweden; Joanne Stares, Public Health Officer at the Public Health Agency of Canada; and public health groups in Belgium.
- The influence of the RIF tool suite may also be felt through efforts that have been made to encourage users to view it as a future community asset rather than just a SAHSU product. To support this end, the RIF team has spent significant effort open sourcing code changes, and publishing design discussions that describe the kinds of informatics challenges it has had to address. 
- The goal of these activities has been to make the development process more transparent to current and future funders, and to eventually provide enough explanation of the tool suite so that its maintenance costs might be able to be spread across prospective collaborators.

It runs in a web browser on a desktop PC or a tablet.

The network or map can be anything that has items (or 'factors' or 'nodes') connected by links (or 'edges').

Here are some examples:

 People (the nodes) connected by knowing each other
 Factors or variables causing (the links) changes in other factors
Switches connected by wires
Computers connected by network links
 Theories expressed as variables and relationships between them
 Company boards of directors (the nodes) and the directors that sit on more than one board (the links)
 Twitter hashtags (the nodes) included together on posts (the links)
 Scientists (the nodes) co-authoring papers (the links)
and so on.
PRSM enables groups of people, each using their own computer (or tablet) to collaborate in the drawing of a map. They may be sitting around a table, discussing the map as it is created face to face, or working remotely, using video conferencing or the chat feature that is built into the app. Everyone can participate because every edit (creating nodes and links, arranging them and so on) is broadcast to all the other participants as the changes are made (just as Google Docs does for text, for example).

When you start PRSM in your browser, a 'room' is created for you in which to draw your network. You can add other users to this room to share the work. Only those with access to the room can see what is being created.","Webtool/Application","Yes","2020","The app has been used in CECAN's work with the Health and Safety Executive and in the NERC project Systemic environmental risk analysis for threats to UK recovery from COVID-19 that Prof Gilbert is associated with.","https://cress.soc.surrey.ac.uk/prsm/","6049e2078e1b48.44270703","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=6049e2078e1b48.44270703&grantRef=ES%2FS007024%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/S007024/1","06DFD00E-A4FD-4E19-AE6D-91AD7C83BF61","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","67B34D05-3A52-4A09-8FF9-F2398D60E246","9E2D8A0A-8687-4F67-AC1F-1EAFB21B62E1"

Sites are hosted at the Natural History Museum London, and offered freely to any scientist that completes an online registration form. They were developed and enhanced through a series of projects, the most substantial of which was the NERC funded eMonocot initiative. Sites can focus on specific taxonomic groups, or the biodiversity of a biogeographic region, or indeed any aspect of natural history. Scratchpads are also suitable for societies or for managing and presenting projects. Key features of Scratchpads (see also Scratchpads feature list) include: tools to manage biological classifications, bibliography management, media (images, video and audio), rich taxon pages (with structured descriptions, specimen records, and distribution data), and character matrices.

Scratchpads support various ways of communicating with site members and visitors such as blogs, forums, newsletters and a commenting system.","Webtool/Application","","2014","Scratchpads have a growing user base of more than 7000 researchers, distributed in 820 different scientific communities.

&quot;An efficient method for the calculation of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics free energies&quot; Christopher J. Woods, Frederick R. Manby and Adrian J. Mulholland J. Chem. Phys. 128 014109 (2008) doi:10.1063/1.2805379 The combination of quantum mechanics (QM) with molecular mechanics (MM) offers a route to improved accuracy in the study of biological systems, and there is now significant research effort being spent to develop QM/MM methods that can be applied to the calculation of relative free energies. Currently, the computational expense of the QM part of the calculation means that there is no single method that achieves both efficiency and rigor; either the QM/MM free energy method is rigorous and computationally expensive, or the method introduces efficiency-led assumptions that can lead to errors in the result, or a lack of generality of application. In this paper we demonstrate a combined approach to form a single, efficient, and, in principle, exact QM/MM free energy method. We demonstrate the application of this method by using it to explore the difference in hydration of water and methane. We demonstrate that it is possible to calculate highly converged QM/MM relative free energies at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ/OPLS level within just two days of computation, using commodity processors, and show how the method allows consistent, high-quality sampling of complex solvent configurational change, both when perturbing hydrophilic water into hydrophobic methane, and also when moving from a MM Hamiltonian to a QM/MM Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate the validity and power of this methodology, and raise important questions regarding the compatibility of MM and QM/MM forcefields, and offer a potential route to improved compatibility.","http://www.siremol.org/Sire/Home.html","54629059ab0b96.44737027","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54629059ab0b96.44737027&grantRef=EP%2FJ010588%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/J010588/1","D3F2B727-59EF-4521-98F2-56B82D3A15A6","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","2A2990B1-E1E1-4888-8848-7C256C3A3B43"

If taxiways cannot be reliably traversed quickly, aircraft can miss valuable assigned slots at the runway or can waste fuel waiting for other aircraft to clear. Efficient algorithms for this problem have been proposed, but little work has considered the uncertainties inherent in the domain. we proposed an adaptive Mamdani fuzzy rule based system to estimate taxi times and their uncertainties. Furthermore, the existing Quickest Path Problem with Time Windows (QPPTW) algorithm is adapted to use fuzzy taxi time estimates.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2018","Experiments with simulated taxi movements at Manchester Airport, the third-busiest in the UK, show the new approach produces routes that are more robust, reducing delays due to uncertain taxi times by 10-20% over the original QPPTW.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X18305461","622b21882377f4.78137021","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=622b21882377f4.78137021&grantRef=EP%2FN029496%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N029496/2","9919DF67-E136-46D8-B2A7-95B048CCD4A3","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","30948BD9-306B-4DE3-B668-EE0A24604BFC"

&quot;An efficient method for the calculation of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics free energies&quot; Christopher J. Woods, Frederick R. Manby and Adrian J. Mulholland J. Chem. Phys. 128 014109 (2008) doi:10.1063/1.2805379 The combination of quantum mechanics (QM) with molecular mechanics (MM) offers a route to improved accuracy in the study of biological systems, and there is now significant research effort being spent to develop QM/MM methods that can be applied to the calculation of relative free energies. Currently, the computational expense of the QM part of the calculation means that there is no single method that achieves both efficiency and rigor; either the QM/MM free energy method is rigorous and computationally expensive, or the method introduces efficiency-led assumptions that can lead to errors in the result, or a lack of generality of application. In this paper we demonstrate a combined approach to form a single, efficient, and, in principle, exact QM/MM free energy method. We demonstrate the application of this method by using it to explore the difference in hydration of water and methane. We demonstrate that it is possible to calculate highly converged QM/MM relative free energies at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ/OPLS level within just two days of computation, using commodity processors, and show how the method allows consistent, high-quality sampling of complex solvent configurational change, both when perturbing hydrophilic water into hydrophobic methane, and also when moving from a MM Hamiltonian to a QM/MM Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate the validity and power of this methodology, and raise important questions regarding the compatibility of MM and QM/MM forcefields, and offer a potential route to improved compatibility.","http://www.siremol.org/Sire/Home.html","54629059ab0b96.44737027","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=54629059ab0b96.44737027&grantRef=EP%2FE022197%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/E022197/1","BB57C680-5AE9-45B7-9B0B-4C5AC773C91A","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","2A2990B1-E1E1-4888-8848-7C256C3A3B43"

PolyCYPs&reg;+ kits for synthesis of CYP and other phase I derived metabolites

Hypha's PolyCYPs&reg;+ screening kit is an easy-to-use in-vitro biocatalytic system for the rapid synthesis of oxidised human and other mammalian metabolites of drugs and agrochemicals. Enzymes in the kit typically oxidise -CH, -CH2, -CH3, -tert-butyl, and iso-propyl moieties when attached to benzene or heterocyclic aromatic residues, as well as dealkylating N- and O-alkyl moieties.

PolyCYPs&reg;+ kit contains more than double the number of CYPs contained in the original kit, and is broadened by the addition of other phase I enzymes. Human aldehyde oxidase (AOX1) and the main human hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO3) are now included in the kit, with other human FMO isoforms available soon. Inclusion of new PolyCYPs isoforms expands coverage of reactions, and have been proven to metabolise some low turnover drugs and produce multi-step oxidised metabolites.","Physical Model/Kit","","2019","PolyCYPs+ kit content

The kit consists of enzyme preparations of 18 PolyCYPs enzymes, AOX1 and FMO3. Also included are ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase redox partners, a cofactor recycling system containing glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+), and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PDH), for use with PolyCYPs and FMO3 enzymes.
In addition to the enzyme preparations, a cyclodextrin-based formulation reagent to aid the solubilisation of test compounds of poor aqueous solubility is included together with a positive control substrate and enzyme.
All reagents are provided as lyophilised powders in sealed vials together with a 24-well reaction plate and air-permeable seal.
Everything is included in the kit that you will need to perform the reaction in your lab, just add water!

The international tech team included Ghanaian, US and UK developers and was made available in Apple and Play Stores in July 2020. Kofi Asare from the Ghana Space Science and Technology Institute in Accra, Ghana, and on the BRAVE team, continues to play a very active role as Principal Coordinator for the RAINWATCH Alliance of now 17 National Met Services. User Groups and the Friends of Rainwatch supported the interface design and test cycles. T","Webtool/Application","","2020","Design consultations with the Zimbabwean team who designed the Kurima Mari app, opened a new partnership with the UNDP and the Zimbabwe National Met Service. As a result, the Zimbabee National Met service jointed the pan-African Rainwatch Alliance as the 17 member and onboarded Rainwatch, with 48 new weather stations added to the Rainwatch Alliance network.

Groundwater information from BRAVE was made available on the App which now reaches 17 different countries.

The App work also led to new partnership discussions with TAHMO (the Trans-African HydroMeteorological Observatory (https://tahmo.org) to supplement the RAINWATCH Alliance network. TAHMO has over 500 AWS across Africa which would provide a real boost to the real-time rainfall information available in RAINWATCH. A MoU was put in place and Ghana Met agreed that TAHMO Ghana would join the Rainwatch Ghana network.","http://www.rainwatch-africa.org","6230791d931259.31549845","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=6230791d931259.31549845&grantRef=NE%2FM008983%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M008983/1","C074E663-3B5F-414A-83E9-804B9180EA42","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","E89C3602-0FB4-4044-A918-58966B8A10B2","8052BB87-7123-4292-9517-F284DD425B3E"

1) Understanding types of corrosion present in fast flowing sea water environments. These include: Uniform Corrosion, Galvanic or Bimetallic Corrosion, Crevice Corrosion, Pitting Corrosion, Erosion Corrosion, Stress Corrosion, Fatigue Corrosion
2) Environmental factors that influence corrosion. There are various environmental factors including: Dissolved Oxygen, Temperature, Water Velocity. The additional environmental implications of damage due to biofouling was not considered in this case, but should be a factor for long term installations.
3) DeltaStream Specific Considerations. One of the advantages of the DeltaStream prototype was the large welded steel structure and corrosion protection for this was important. Other materials were present in the design and careful choices needed to be made in a number of design detail areas.
4) Mitigation measures were recommended for long term maintenance of the effective function of the device.","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2017","This methodology made a direct impact on the choice of materials and hence the fundamental design of the turbine.",,"5c6ab7f2312eb0.39596860","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5c6ab7f2312eb0.39596860&grantRef=EP%2FN509826%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N509826/1","AC0ED71F-30EB-4DBA-9992-46AD329B9C9F","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","AB307619-D4FA-427E-A042-09DBEBA84669","9E5D9AE0-75F3-4D40-8093-0DCE79AD2232"

Significant costs arise from the installation process itself along with subsequent removal as part of the maintenance cycle. Currently the marine renewable industry largely relies on the use of offshore construction vessels from the oil &amp; gas sector which can cost in the region of &pound;125k per day. Downtime cost is also significant whilst waiting for favourable conditions in which to carry out the removal and/or installation process. CFD modelling has been used to assess the loadings on the nacelle of a horizontal axis tidal stream turbine associated with its installation at the slack period of a neap tide. The CFD code used for this assessment is avaialble.

Accordingly, bodies feel a steric repulsion energy that is proportional to their overlapping volume, resulting into a repulsion force that is applied at the center of the overlapping volume. The force is calculated numerically as the negative gradient of this energy. Because volume is an extensive quantity, the calculation of this volume can be split into a number of parts and summed up. Furthermore, the resulting force does not depend on any path, and so it is a conservative force. The description of this force was presented also in the PLOS Computational Biology paper together with the FFEA software package.","Software","Yes","2017","The FFEA was previously modelling short range interactions using a Lennard-Jones potential, using a Gaussian quadrature scheme. However, that was often leading to a very strong force resulting making the simulation to explode. The new approach is much more stable, allowing significantly larger time steps (between 10 and 100 times larger), thus resulting in larger and longer simulations.","https://bitbucket.org/FFEA/ffea/src/d148a358bcf82262631d5101dd5d29ae6d151e6d/src/VdW_solver.cpp?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default","5aa7d4603f5671.74270985","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5aa7d4603f5671.74270985&grantRef=EP%2FM004228%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M004228/1","4F88396C-0157-4A61-AAC5-8956160AEB70","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","E7B0395A-BE02-4637-92E0-F9427FA7CCFC"

The purpose is to hide the implementation details from either an end-user or an application developer so that the users can focus on the algorithm and application. 

The project is split into two phases. In the first phase, we have developed function sequence that will enable the user to combine the provided lattice Boltzmann models (e.g., provided equilibrium functions, boundary conditions and forces terms) to simulate a scientific problem. In the second phase we have proposed and implemented a few key templated objects that can help researchers to write the so-called user-defined function (UDF) and develop their applications easily as well as an experimental python translator for the same purpose. 

The proposed abstract is released at https://gitlab.com/jpmeng/hilemms, whilst two backend codes (i.e., OPS based and AMReX based) are released at https://github.com/jpmeng/MPLB by DL and https://github.com/otbrown/LAMBReX by EPCC.","Software","Yes","2020","By developing the high-level abstraction approach, we enable the declarative programming paradigm for the lattice Boltzmann modelling.

For the backend code developed at DL, we have attracted a couple of groups to use the code, namely, the State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University on environmental research, the University of Edinburgh on additive manufacturing. A group at the University of Durham start to tentatively explore the usage of code.

Different case studies have been analysed handling building elements that have the potential to provide significant improvements in terms of energy efficiency and reduction of costs and emissions. 
Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) methods have excellent potential for achieving the desired objectives since they enable straightforward integration of physical building constraints and maximum performance assessments to provide continual optimisation of the building management processes. 
A first case study presented an approach to simultaneous optimisation of design and operation of a residential building taking into account external weather conditions, as well as varying energy prices. 
The case study showcased the potential of the co-design framework in enhancing flexibility, self-sufficiency and achieving cost-effectiveness of the system. 
The presented co-design framework enables straightforward integration of the constraints related to the thermal comfort of the occupants, as well as the inclusion of cyclic constraints to take into account the seasonal storage. Batteries, PV panels and seasonal thermochemical storage, coupled with thermal solar, show benefits in increasing seasonal, intermittent renewable hosting capability.
In the second case study, a short-horizon MPC formulation handling phenomena happening on multiple time scales through the determination of appropriate terminal condition has been investigated.
The results show that omitting the long term dynamics cause significant degradation of the performance.
In the last case studies, the analysis has focused on the integration of electric vehicles and demand-side response schemes in the building.
Both cases have shown an increase in system flexibility and adaptability to support the wider energy system.
The technical details are available in the submitted deliverables.

(please refer to 'BMAC_app' section in Software and Technical Products). Consequently, BAs can interpret and action upon a functional analysis of these data in order to implement new / modified interventions. The web portal is linked with a data-mining component (please refer to section on research databases and models), which is used to extract patterns occurring within the recorded data, based on the application of association rule mining to link data attributes.

The data collected is visualised using appropriate charts, graphs and text in order to provide summarised and structured information to users, to assist with highlighting behaviour correlations associated with varying environmental causes and effects. Furthermore, the web portal is also used to support communication between BAs and parents via the BMAC mobile application at home. This can be general information relating to autism, specific guidance about a particular intervention procedure and / or other useful information/ links as well as personalised intervention direction, pertaining to observations made through the web portal. As a result, this component of the system endeavours to augment traditional and on-going face-to-face interactions between BAs, parents and children rather than serve to replace them.","Webtool/Application","","2014","The developed web tool automates many of the manual processes currently employed by parents and Behaviour Analysts (BAs) within a home-based autism intervention setting. Specifically, the tool provides instant visualisation of recorded data through the provision of a user driven user interface that aggregates, summarises and showcases clinically important patterns in behaviour. These visualisation services alone offer significant potential for increasing BA's ability to discover behaviour patterns and to subsequently introduce more timely home-based intervention treatments. 

The visualisation service is further supported via a data mining service that highlights (based on the application of association rule modelling) the 'predicted' causes and effects of particular behaviour by mining previously recorded data from one or more individuals with autism. The service, while requiring further validation through longer user evaluations to generate more data, has the potential to reduce the workload of BAs by supporting them with functional analysis of a child's behaviour.","http://193.61.148.237/~e10426674/BMAC/WP","544e21aa640f82.43694435","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=544e21aa640f82.43694435&grantRef=EP%2FK014420%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K014420/1","5AB5A8A9-A075-4906-915C-BA9333B83FE1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","245EB81A-808F-4697-BAED-263C20266B74","41701417-93C5-41CB-8612-17483EBD0FFA"

A game interface has been introduced with which it is possible to introduce environmental events and incidents for the players having to cooperate to solve problems.
Game types that can be configured include: (i) Design-related tasks - constructing networks so as to minimize future problems where interactions are compared to a metric so as to evaluate how compliant it is with relevant engineering standards; (ii) Post-incident tasks: diagnostic of problem(s) and mitigation actions; and (iii) Optimisation tasks: single-user or multi-user optimisation.

The software has currently been designed. Parts of it will be built in the current project for testing, however full development will require further funding. 

The software designed guides caregivers in reporting on the baseline levels of resistance to change and flexibility in routines for their child. Individual parameters (i.e. criteria for success and levels of acceptability behavioural responses) can be set to cater for widely varying ability levels and experiences of families. Training elements are integrated into the system so that parents have ongoing implementation support. Rules for progression programmed into the system support parents to systematically introduce variability to their child's routine, whilst maintaining enough environmental structure to minimise challenging behaviours associated with changes to routine or expectations. Information collected by the system is stored such that this is readily available for parents to track progress, and allows children to establish a sense of ownership and achievement to maintain engagement. The system can also track previous success and so can scaffold re-introduction of mastered targets to ensure the effects of the intervention are maintained.","Software","","2019","The software has been designed but not yet fully developed.

Bacterial cells are represented as discrete geometric entities which may have internal processes and interact with their environment. Modellers may describe specific bacterial behaviour, environmental factors and the spatial arrangement of cellular populations, this is achieved via composing library modules into a model specification. Modules describe specific features to be simulated and are parameterisable, the library is extendable to allow for novel models of relevant processes to be added to the tool. Simulations can be run on mulit-threaded and multi-CPU environments to ensure the platform can represent industrially relevant systems.

Individual methylation profiles are determined by both genetic and environmental influences. Inter-individual variation in DNA methylation profiles can be exploited to estimate or predict a wide variety of human characteristics and disease risk profiles. Indeed, a number of methylation-based predictors of human traits have been developed and linked to important health outcomes. However, there is an unmet need to communicate the applicability and limitations of state-of-the-art methylation-based predictors to the wider community. To address this, we created a secure, web-based interactive platform called 'MethylDetectR' which calculates estimated values or scores for a variety of human traits using blood methylation data. These traits include age, lifestyle traits, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the levels of 27 blood proteins related to inflammatory and neurological processes and disease. Methylation-based predictors often return scores on arbitrary scales. To provide meaning to these scores, users can interactively view how estimated trait scores for a given individual compare against other individuals in the sample. Users can optionally upload binary phenotypes and investigate how estimated traits vary according to case vs. control status for these phenotypes. Users can also view how different methylation-based predictors correlate with one another, and with phenotypic values for corresponding traits in a large reference sample (n = 4,450; Generation Scotland). The 'MethylDetectR' platform allows for the fast and secure calculation of DNA methylation-derived estimates for many human traits. This platform also helps to show the correlations between methylation-based scores and corresponding traits at the level of a sample, report estimated health profiles at an individual level, demonstrate how scores relate to important binary outcomes of interest and highlight the current limitations of molecular health predictors.","Software","Yes","2021","We have demonstrated proof of concept - that the software will provide potentially actionable information on disease risk and the presence of modifiable behaviours","https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-283","6048db90a44ef5.94101938","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=6048db90a44ef5.94101938&grantRef=MC_PC_17209","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MC_PC_17209","1F14AE45-7C1B-4659-BB88-263E1BC09E50","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","349A380A-1097-45AC-ACEE-D801E72E4F6B"

The tag contains tri-axial accelerometer, pressure, water temperature, optical dissolved oxygen and heading sensors. The optical DO sensor maintains calibration for long periods of time (months). The printed circuit boards (PCBs) contain a low-power accelerometer, magnetometer, depth and temperature sensors enabling fine-scale 3D movements of tagged animals to be recorded; the tag is recovered after it releases from a predator and can be re-used. Given the large amounts of data typically produced by accelerometers, the sampling rate is configurable and varies between 1 and 50 Hz, with a mini-storage device (microSD card) incorporated to enable environmental data to be collected at very high temporal resolution (1s) allowing 3D movements to be linked with oxygen gradients during dives ('casts'). Furthermore, the tag can record subtle body movements associated with tail beat frequency, power-glide cycles, and overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) that can be used as a proxy for energy expenditure in the wild (field metabolic rate; see next section). A timed-release device releases the tag from the fish and a GPS unit allows tag recovery when it floats to the surface. The tag will enable short, 1-3 d data-rich deployments on free-ranging sharks and tunas that potentially dive to 1,700m. A second version incorporating a video camera (DVL2000M; Little Leonardo, Tokyo) has been built that records prey concentrations encountered at different depth and DO environments (down to 2000 m and incorporating red LED lights for recording in the dark).","New/Improved Technique/Technology","","2019","The tag has been tested in the lab and in large aquaria, and has been trialled on ocean sunfish at sea where it collected data on dissolved oxygen, depth and temperature along the swimming paths of fish for 4 days.

Pass-through measurements are inevitably smoothed and altered by the convolution effect of SRM sensor response, and deconvolution is needed to restore high-resolution paleomagnetic and environmental signals. Although various deconvolution algorithms have been developed, the lack of easy-to-use software has hindered the practical application of deconvolution. Here, we present standalone graphical software UDECON as a convenient tool to perform optimized deconvolution for pass-through paleomagnetic measurements using the algorithm recently developed by Oda and Xuan (Geochem Geophys Geosyst 15:3907-3924, 2014). With the preparation of a format file, UDECON can directly read pass-through paleomagnetic measurement files collected at different laboratories. After the SRM sensor response is determined and loaded to the software, optimized deconvolution can be conducted using two different approaches (i.e., &quot;Grid search&quot; and &quot;Simplex method&quot;) with adjustable initial values or ranges for smoothness, corrections of sample length, and shifts in measurement position. UDECON provides a suite of tools to view conveniently and check various types of original measurement and deconvolution data. Multiple steps of measurement and/or deconvolution data can be compared simultaneously to check the consistency and to guide further deconvolution optimization. Deconvolved data together with the loaded original measurement and SRM sensor response data can be saved and reloaded for further treatment in UDECON. Users can also export the optimized deconvolution data to a text file for analysis in other software.","Software","Yes","2015","The associated paper has been accessed close to 1000 times since its publication, and has been cited three times.

The dataset used to develop the models consisted of dose-response data from 11 NMs (5 TiO2 NMs of identical cores with different coatings, and 6 Ag NMs with different capping agents/coatings) each dispersed in three different media (a high hardness medium (HH Combo) and two artificial waters with different ionic strengths and natural organic matter contents.
The available numerical descriptors (TEM size, DLS size, electrophoretic mobility, zeta potential at pH = 7.6-7.8, medium conductivity, tested concentration) were normalized (by applying the Gaussian normalization method) in order to guarantee their equal contribution to the analysis.
The grouping hypothesis is that environmental ageing of nanomaterials will reduce their ecotoxicity to Daphnia magna compared to the freshly dispersed nanomaterials, and that this will be more pronounced for the media containing natural organic matter than for the salt-only medium. To evaluate the adequacy of this hypothesis, we used the k nearest neighbours (kNN) methodology by dividing the initial dataset into subgroups of nanomaterials of the same age (i.e., freshly dispersed versus 2-year aged) and developing two separate models in each subgroup.
Validation assessed compliance of the models with the entire set of OECD principles, presented as a QSAR model report form (QMRF) report, in addition to internal validation via the leave-one-out (LOO) and leave-ten-out (L10O) cross-validation (CV) method applied to the training set.","Webtool/Application","Yes","2021","This is the first model for prediction of ecotoxicity of nanomaterials in daphnia - this is a regulatory endpoint so having a read-across model to assess acute toxicity of pristine nad environmentally aged nanomaterials is a critical first step.

The UK Water Resources Portal has been developed as a demonstrator to showcase the use of multiple variables: rainfall, river flow, groundwater and soil moisture from COSMOS-UK, in the raw data format as well as standardised indices, to view various plotting styles and view data for multiple sites.

It is a development of the UK Drought Portal which has been updated each month since June 2017. The UK Drought Portal however, showed only a commonly used drought indicator - the Standardised Precipitation Index. Within ENDOWS we worked with South West Water and the Environment Agency in Devon and Cornwall to develop a prototype portal for the south west of England to work out how these different datasets can be brought together and how data can be presented to work alongside existing monitoring tools such as Environment Agency Water Situation Reports.

The portal provides access to the following datasets;

Rainfall from the Met Office (gridded, and over gauged catchments and hydrometric areas)
River flows from the National River Flow Archive (for historical data) and Environment Agency (for real-time data)
Soil moisture (from CEH's COSMOS-UK network)

The portal allows users to explore these datasets spatially, using a map interface, and then to plot graphs showing time series data of these variables for their selected locations.

There are a number of ways these datasets can be visualised. For rainfall, river flows and soil moisture, the raw data can be plotted. In this mode, for river flows, the map shows colours displaying the current daily/monthly flow in the context of the historical record using coloured 'bands' (exceptionally high, notably high, and so on to notably low and exceptionally low).

When users click on the points, hydrographs are shown of the recent flows against these same bandings - as used in the Water Situation Reports produced by the Enivronment Agency. We adopted this visualisation approach following feedback from users in the water industry, as these are widely used for communication.

Users can also choose to show the current flows against maximum and minimum flows, and against historical drought years. This is very useful for practitioners wishing to assess how the current river flow situation compares with known, major historical droughts, for example.

For COSMOS-UK, the soil moisture data records only date back up to five years so the time periods are too short to use bandings, and the sites are not coloured on the map. Users can still plot time series of soil moisture against the historical maximums and minimums. Importantly, users can plot both soil moisture and river flow graphs next to one another to compare these variables.

The river flows and rainfall data can also be presented as 'standardised indicators' as used on the UK Drought Portal. Once again, the current values of the indicators are shown as colours on the map, and when locations are clicked, time series plots of the indicators can be shown.

These standardised indicators essentially show the anomalies from the long-term average, with negative values indicating that it was drier than normal or flows were lower than normal, and positive values that it was wetter than normal or flows were higher than normal. The way these indicators are calculated means that you can compare values across time and space making them useful to monitor the hydrological situation.","Webtool/Application","","2019","The new portal is aimed at anyone with an interest in current water resources situation or drought conditions.

Given the interactive nature of the portal and the capacity to explore data on a localised scale, we also hope it provides a useful dataset for the media and the wider public.

The primary focus of the portal is for water resources and drought applications, but it can also be useful for tracking river flows and soil moisture in real time in order to provide an indication about high flows, as well as low flows. Other real-time services exist for real-time flood level monitoring, and these are the primary outlets that should be consulted from a flood warning perspective.

Jansen J, Wortmann CS, Stockton MC, Kaizzi CK (2013). Maximizing net returns to financially constrained fertilizer use. Agronomy Journal 105 (3) 573-578. The Fertilizer Optimizer tool was built as part of the Optimising Fertilizer Recommendations in Africa (OFRA) project, led by CABI. The project was a partnership between CABI, the University of Nebraska Lincoln, national governments and agricultural research and extension systems in 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. OFRA was supported by the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). 
 
In this project this spreadsheet-based tool was converted to an Android app and validated against the original spreadsheet version. This included transferring the spreadsheet logic over to an Android app, and providing parameters for crop and the sixty agro-environmental zones. Translation of the interface was completed and as well as English, French and Portuguese are now supported. An upgrade to a mobile phone app now offers farmers across Africa even more benefits and cutting-edge fertilizer use technology. This will help farmers to grow healthier, more productive with increasingly profitable crops, as a result of more informed use of how small amounts of fertilizer impact the crops which they grow.

Pilot work on the CABI Fertilizer Optimizer app in Uganda has shown that some farmers realised up to a seven-fold increase in yields. Using funding from the BBSRC Global Challenges Research Fund, the app has now been upgraded to make it easier to use. The new app includes the integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) practices feature, and a calibration tool which helps farmers to apply the right quantity of fertilizer to their crops.

The Fertilizer Optimizer app is designed to help resource constrained farmers to maximise the return on investment on fertilizer, based on what the farmer can realistically afford. 

In the latest version of the Fertilizer Optimizer app it is possible to calibrate the fertilizer recommendation to the planting conditions of a user's field. Version 1 of the app provided users with an amount of fertilizer to use and an application rate (e.g. 5kg per hectare). Now it is possible to enter field measurements, container sizes and preferred application technique and the app will help to evenly distribute the recommended fertilizers across the crop providing actionable information tailored to a particular field.","Software","Yes","2019","The Fertilizer Optimizer has been produced for: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia and is available to use in English, French and Portuguese.

Open Soils Data Platform BBS/OS/GC/200014B 
 
We have developed and implemented an Open Soils data Platform that enables the storage and searching of multiple information sources on soils e.g. soil samples and support materials such as reports for sub-Saharan Africa. The platform uses an agreed set of metadata and controlled vocabularies needed for integrating a range of data. Prototype metadata integration for several data collections has been achieved enabling searching of the catalogue for datasets containing related-information on soils information. The architecture developed is easily extensible to other information resources and databases as soon as they become viable

Issues emerged regarding access to data from African sources e.g OFRA but discussions with these and others are ongoing. The continuing objectives are to engage with stakeholders to populate the catalogue with additional datasets so it becomes a valued repository of data for soil health for Africa",,"5c7d1de6ca64d3.19419912","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=5c7d1de6ca64d3.19419912&grantRef=BBS%2FE%2FC%2F000I0310","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BBS/E/C/000I0310","BE33E54A-77A5-4810-AB7C-C02FB20F31F0","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","ACD5F1CF-266C-4CDE-A399-43DC93429CF9","D85D728C-85FE-4060-A49A-06FFEC588534"

The UK Water Resources Portal has been developed as a demonstrator to showcase the use of multiple variables: rainfall, river flow, groundwater and soil moisture from COSMOS-UK, in the raw data format as well as standardised indices, to view various plotting styles and view data for multiple sites.

It is a development of the UK Drought Portal which has been updated each month since June 2017. The UK Drought Portal however, showed only a commonly used drought indicator - the Standardised Precipitation Index. Within ENDOWS we worked with South West Water and the Environment Agency in Devon and Cornwall to develop a prototype portal for the south west of England to work out how these different datasets can be brought together and how data can be presented to work alongside existing monitoring tools such as Environment Agency Water Situation Reports.

The portal provides access to the following datasets;

Rainfall from the Met Office (gridded, and over gauged catchments and hydrometric areas)
River flows from the National River Flow Archive (for historical data) and Environment Agency (for real-time data)
Soil moisture (from CEH's COSMOS-UK network)

The portal allows users to explore these datasets spatially, using a map interface, and then to plot graphs showing time series data of these variables for their selected locations.

There are a number of ways these datasets can be visualised. For rainfall, river flows and soil moisture, the raw data can be plotted. In this mode, for river flows, the map shows colours displaying the current daily/monthly flow in the context of the historical record using coloured 'bands' (exceptionally high, notably high, and so on to notably low and exceptionally low).

When users click on the points, hydrographs are shown of the recent flows against these same bandings - as used in the Water Situation Reports produced by the Enivronment Agency. We adopted this visualisation approach following feedback from users in the water industry, as these are widely used for communication.

Users can also choose to show the current flows against maximum and minimum flows, and against historical drought years. This is very useful for practitioners wishing to assess how the current river flow situation compares with known, major historical droughts, for example.

For COSMOS-UK, the soil moisture data records only date back up to five years so the time periods are too short to use bandings, and the sites are not coloured on the map. Users can still plot time series of soil moisture against the historical maximums and minimums. Importantly, users can plot both soil moisture and river flow graphs next to one another to compare these variables.

The river flows and rainfall data can also be presented as 'standardised indicators' as used on the UK Drought Portal. Once again, the current values of the indicators are shown as colours on the map, and when locations are clicked, time series plots of the indicators can be shown.

These standardised indicators essentially show the anomalies from the long-term average, with negative values indicating that it was drier than normal or flows were lower than normal, and positive values that it was wetter than normal or flows were higher than normal. The way these indicators are calculated means that you can compare values across time and space making them useful to monitor the hydrological situation.","Webtool/Application","","2019","The new portal is aimed at anyone with an interest in current water resources situation or drought conditions. We envisage this would include a wide range of people involved in water management, e.g. water supply companies, policymakers, regulators, consultants, academics, farmers and growers, businesses (particularly those which are heavily dependent on water abstractions) and power companies. Given the interactive nature of the portal and the capacity to explore data on a localised scale, we also hope it provides a useful dataset for the media and the wider public.

The primary focus of the portal is for water resources and drought applications, but it can also be useful for tracking river flows and soil moisture in real time in order to provide an indication about high flows, as well as low flows. Other real-time services exist for real-time flood level monitoring, and these are the primary outlets that should be consulted from a flood warning perspective. The portal offers a way of exploring the full range of river flow variability, including comparing current conditions to those in the past, from droughts to floods and all points in between.

This enables the development of Individual (agent) Based Models at much finer spatial and temporal scales than was previously possible. 

The behavioral parameters of Anopheles gambiae and other mosquitoes interacting with bed nets during host-seeking have recently been exploited at LSTM to create a novel virtual testing simulation, InFliTE (Insect Flight Testing Environment), allowing a wide range of innovative vector control ideas, both actual and theoretical, to be rapidly and easily assessed at marginal cost. 

The resulting model, described herein, represents a simple to use computer software package, capable of simulating vector behavior in a virtual mosquito population and its subsequent response to, and interactions with, environmental stimuli (including vector control tools). It allows the end user to compare, quantitatively and visually, alternative designs of vector control tools or systems, individually or in combination. 

To capture the complex interactions between mosquitoes and their environment we require a method which is fine-grained enough to represent individual model flight tracks and the subsequent interactions with their local environment. Yet most modelling approaches to vector behavior set the scale at the higher level (i.e. multiple houses, of transmission between villages), for example (Eckhoff, 2011, Gu et. al, 2003). The InFliTE model utilizes a novel fine-grained agent-based (or individual-based) modelling approach whereby very simple rules generate complex environment/host interactions. A population of mobile virtual mosquito insects are created. These individuals fly in a continuous 3D space representation inside a discretized spatial arena, representing an insectary or hut containing a bed net and human host.

The population is introduced at the release site and begins to explore the arena. To respond to host stimulus cues, a method of generating and propagating an attractant plume via diffusion and convection is required. We adopt a discrete approach to this propagation, dividing the arena into a 3D lattice of 10CM3 regions (for computational tractability). The host bait profile is configurable to represent hosts of different sizes and the cells making up the bait profile are color-coded to indicate regions where greater concentrations of attractant (for example, CO2, skin odors) are emanated. At each scheduler step attractant is projected at bait profile locations and diffusion is implemented for all cells in the lattice volume by dispersing the attractant between the current cell and the 26 nearest neighbor cells. Convection is implemented for all cells by dispersing a fraction of each cell to the cell immediately above the current cell in the arena. Both the diffusion weight and convection weights can be specified before an experiment starts to give different attractant stimulus profile.

Virtual mosquito flight behavior is designed to minimize the number of model parameters, provide a simple to understand method of flight orientation, yet also to minimize the number of assumptions on insect flight. Each virtual mosquito samples the local attractant plume gradient and orients itself towards the highest local concentration. Sensory parameters (Sensor Angle, Rotation Angle, Sensor Offset distance, Velocity) can be altered to generate foraging and host-seeking flight paths of differing tortuosity. The actual desired tortuosity value may be established from the published data based on insect flight tracking (Parker et. Al, 2015, Dekker and Card&eacute;, 2011). Insect behavioral transitions are currently focused on host-seeking behavior and the interactions with the environment (including LLINs) and is represented by a relatively simple state transition function. This approach is expandable and allows the potential for future increases in the number and range of environmental interactions (for example, the inclusion of features such windows, doors, traps, surface coatings etc.).
The InFliTE model replicates experimental findings relating to the presence or absence of a human host. We found differences in exploration of an arena when human bait is present or absent. In the presence of bait, a narrow field of the arena is explored, whereas the virtual population explores a much larger area of the arena when no host is present. 
The model also reproduces the findings in (Lynd and McCall, 2013) which demonstrated the most preferred landing site at a human baited bed net. The virtual mosquito population also exhibits a preference for the top surface of the bed net closest to the head of a human host. In an unbaited net, however, there are markedly fewer bed net contact events, with a random distribution of activity at the net.

When no host is present there are very few contacts with the bed net as the virtual population is not attracted to the net. When a host is present, however, the number of contact events increases (following a spatial distribution at the top surface of the net). The reduction in bed net contact events when an insecticide treated net covering a human host is present, is a result of the gradual reduction in population health after cumulative bed net contact events with the treated net. These results match the findings reported in (Parker et. Al, 2015) of the rapid efficacy of LLINs and also approximate the spatio-temporal dynamics recorded by the same group using real-time image tracking equipment. With no bait and an untreated net there is approximately uniform flight path distributions. When a host is present under an untreated net there is an intense spatial distribution about the top surface of the net near the head of the host. When a treated net is used above a host there is the same spatial distribution pattern, but a rapid fall-off in mosquito activity in both experimental and model conditions.

We find good correspondence between the simulation results and the experimental results using the tracking system. We continue to gather and collate data and plan to submit a paper for publication. We also propose to submit a funding application to extend the model to add additional features which we believe will be useful in the acceleration of vector control tools.","Software","","2017","We believe that our results provide scope to extend the model to cope with different real-life scenarios.","http://www.lstm.co.uk","59a59803bb62b0.88858425","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=59a59803bb62b0.88858425&grantRef=MC_PC_15040","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MC_PC_15040","58D5CE6A-81E2-4995-B56C-8B7C69D8E351","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3ED60B49-9C2B-4D71-B644-96CCC7F10194","35C0CE50-61C8-4951-A6BD-C121ABC82F8E"
