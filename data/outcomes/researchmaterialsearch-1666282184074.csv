The assessment is designed to capture localised, spatially located wetland condition data suitable for modelling wetland ecosystem services under land use, land management and climate change. The assessment draws upon a number of existing methods and tools, notably the Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) (V&aring;gen et al. 2013), Wetland ecosystem service assessment (WET Eco services) (Kotze et al. 2008), National Soil Inventory of Scotland (Lilly et al. 2010), Ugandan National Wetland Inventory system (NWIS)(Henninger and Landsberg 2009) and Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA) (Peh et al. 2013). 
The WES assessment survey identifies soil, water and vegetation characteristics in geo-located sampled sites to estimate ecosystem service provision. Collected data is processed for appraising the current provision of wetland services due to wetland management and land uses, particularly C stocks, while establishing a baseline from which to monitor changes in ecosystem properties, functions and services. 
The ALTER WES survey was developed during field trials and implementation in wetland sites in Kabale District, Uganda in 2016. Wetland systems in Kabale are characterised by valley bottom, fluvial fed wetlands under a gradient of wetland land use change, including papyrus wetlands and wetland potato cultivation.

The aim of this project is to work closely with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) to co-design a toolkit for evaluating the climate change mitigation and co-benefits potential of proposed authority led projects. The ability to adequately evaluate project proposals at the Executive Committee deliberation stage is identified by GMCA as a key barrier to delivery of their transformative Environment Plan. The toolkit will be co-designed with users and support both the design stage of proposed projects to enhance carbon reduction and co-benefits and give decision-makers a consistent way of comparing and evaluating projects. This project will compliment (though is not contingent upon) a PCAN fund proposal (currently shortlisted) on linking together project evaluation practices with authorities throughout the UK. Where the compatibility with proposed PCAN work can further leverage this work, this is indicated in the proposal.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2020","Deliverables: 
Toolkit and guidance document for local authority project evaluation. Whilst the final content of the toolkit will be shaped through stakeholder collaboration, we anticipate it will consist of a step by step guide, a simple form linked to an excel sheet to estimate potential carbon impacts, and a short video tutorial. The carbon element (which is the focus of this proposal) will ultimately sit within a wider package of toolkit elements that support embedding co-benefits in project design and evaluation (an output from the CAST cities project 3.4). Projects proposed as part of delivering the Greater Manchester Environment Plan will be our case study, but the toolkit will have general applicability to support better consideration of carbon impacts at key stages of local authority executive decision making. The toolkit will be co-developed with the Research &amp; Evaluation and Sustainability teams in GMCA and CAST researchers (Carly McLachlan and Angela Mae Minas).

The tool provides an integrated platform for exploring ecosystem services flows and associated economic value delivered by the natural environment. The tool provides functionality for users to explore a range of ecosystem services, this grant funded initial development work on greenhouse gas sequestration from timber and recreation values related to land use. Following this proof of concept, additional funding has enabled the project team to substantially expand the remit of the tool to include food, timber, greenhouse gas sequestration, recreation, water quality, water quantity and biodiversity provided by the current composition of land use across England and Wales from 2020 out to the year 2060 based on mid-level projections of climate change from the IPCC (UKCIP09). The tool can be used at a variety of spatial scales including country, government office region, local authority, catchment and subcatchment, national parks, or the finest resolution which is a 2km grid cell level. 

Alter: Users are also able to use the tool to define scenarios which alter the current land use or prices. The tool predicts the response of land use and the flow of ecosystem services over time.
Optimise: The tool also includes an optimisation functionality which allows users to specify an objective (e.g. maximise economic value from woodlands, or maximise quantity outcomes such as a biodiversity metric) and a policy mechanism e.g. replacing agricultural land with new woodlands. The tool then calculates the optimal spatial locations to achieve the objective and returns a breakdown of the locations and changes in ecosystem service flows.

This will encourage both better decision-making and clearly demonstrate the results of positive sustainable action during development.

The NATURE Tool allows assessing up to 17 ecosystem services plus physical and mental health benefits through a scoring system indicating both, the direction and magnitude of project impacts. These scores are aggregated based on policy priorities resulting in an overall 'people score' for the project. 

The tool is free to use, applicable across the UK and designed for the application by non-specialists without requiring excessive data or time. The tool can be used across different project stages and at different scales. The minimum requirements are a defined site boundary, habitat data and data on the accessibility of greenspaces of the site.

The NATURE Tool can also be tailored to a local or corporate version, allowing the 'objective setter' to define policy priorities and natural capital objectives a project should achieve. This means that a local planning authority, for example, can create its own NATURE Tool version where natural capital priorities and objectives are pre-defined. Any applicable development project in that area then has clear and objectively measurable natural capital objectives to work towards.
Who should use the tool?

The NATURE Tool is aimed for all built environment professionals, planners and related stakeholders with a stake in projects that could affect natural capital such as through land-use or management changes. This includes most planning and development projects including housing and infrastructure. But it can also be used to assess the natural capital impact of conservation and afforestation projects, for example. Some examples of potential tool users can be found below.
Background

In the UK and beyond, there is a growing need for efficient ways to deliver built development such as housing and transport infrastructure in line with the goals of sustainable development. Widespread calls by sustainability leaders for a green recovery in response to Covid-19 have heightened this need. Over recent years, the ambition to secure environmental net-gain (ENG) from new developments have grown.ENG is an approach to development that aims to leave the natural environment in a measurably better state than beforehand. This environmental improvement ambition is the basis for HM Government's 25 Year Environment Plan.

Leaving the environment in 'a better state' must mean much more than net gain for biodiversity (species and habitats). Whilst this is important, evidence and advice presented by the Natural Capital Committee (an official advisor to HM Government) highlight that this ambition must involve protection and enhancement of the core contributions of natural features to wellbeing and prosperity.

These contributions - sometimes labelled ecosystem services - include regulation of air quality (such as through removal of particles from vehicle emissions), sequestration of carbon, mental and physical health benefits through access to natural outdoor spaces, and flood risk reduction. With the green recovery and 'build back better', now is the time to enable this ambition to be turned into project delivery. International assessments such as the IPBES global assessment report will ensure that ENG is promoted worldwide.

Sustainable land-use change will only be possible if natural capital is appropriately managed within land use planning and the built environment professions. While an increasing number of local planning authorities (LPAs) and developers recognise their obligations in relation to climate and nature, they often lack the time, resources and expertise to measure the impacts of proposals in relation to the impact on natural capital and the functionality of places for people.
Project Introduction

A key industry challenge for the built environment sector to be resolved was how natural capital impacts and net-gains for the environment can be measured and assessed objectively and efficiently. In response, WSP and the Ecosystems Knowledge Network (EKN), in collaboration with Northumbria University, have developed the Nature Assessment Tool for Urban and Rural Environments (short: the NATURE Tool) to enable built environment professionals to define and objectively assess, measure and manage to what extent new plans or developments achieve net-gains for the environment. While a variety of existing tools currently attempt to measure changes in ecosystem services throughout development, no tool currently situates this change within the context of net-gain. The project aim was to co-develop the NATURE Tool which answers the crucial environmental net-gain question as a new industry standard meeting needs in all four parts of the UK.

In June 2021, the first prototype of the tool was shared with industry partners for testing. Version 1.0 has been released on 27th July 2021 as a BETA version and is free to use. Our project partnership is in the process of testing the NATURE Tool at more than 30 projects across all 4 UK jurisdictions, covering different green infrastructure setting (urban to rural), project sizes and project types. The feedback from these tests will inform the development of the next NATURE Tool versions. Utilising the project partnership was essential for the tool to meet the requirements of the end-users - a tool developed by industry for industry. The NATURE Tool has been developed with partial funding from Innovate UK.

The NATURE Tool has three assessment pillars (asset, service flow and benefits) and results are summarised in two headline indicators, biodiversity and people. Within the NATURE Tool, biodiversity relates to impacts on wildlife and species resilience (this is captured primarily through BNG assessments). 'People' on the other hand relates to the impact of a development on people in the context of ecosystem services and health benefits.

Essentially, the tool user enters the habitat areas before and after an intervention as well as the level of accessibility of the site. The tool then automatically calculates natural capital performance and impact using six key indicators:

 Change Score - how will a project impact on the natural capital performance in relation to the baseline (pre-development)?
 Potential Score - to what extent has the maximum site potential for natural capital been achieved?
 Completeness Score - how complete is the assessment? This is defined as a measure of how detailed the entered habitat categories are and to what extent optional indicators were used.
 Policy Priority - the policy priority (high, medium and low) based on national policy or as defined by the objective setter. The policy priorities determine how ecosystem services and benefits are weighted when aggregated to an overall people (project) score.
 All Objectives Met? - will the project achieve the natural capital objectives as defined by the objective setter (see below)? Objectives can be defined for the Change Score, Potential Score and Completeness Score.
 Achievements - does the project achieve Net Gain (NG) and/or even a bronze, silver or gold 'excellence standard'? This helps you to highlight and communicate really positive natural capital impact.

The NATURE Tool can also be used to assess the natural capital baseline of a site. In this case, the tool calculates (per-ha) baseline scores as well as the potential scores only.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2021","the tool has been co developed with 38 partners and tested on a wide range of development and environmental applications.

Eco-innovations, eco-efficiency and corporate social responsibility practices define much of the current industrial sustainability agenda. While important, they are insufficient in themselves to deliver the holistic changes necessary to achieve long-term social and environmental sustainability. How can we encourage corporate innovation that significantly changes the way companies operate to ensure greater sustainability?

Sustainable business models (SBM) incorporate a triple bottom line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests, including environment and society. They are important in driving and implementing corporate innovation for sustainability, can help embed sustainability into business purpose and processes, and serve as a key driver of competitive advantage.

Many innovative approaches may contribute to delivering sustainability through business models, but have not been collated under a unifying theme of business model innovation. The literature and business practice review has identified a wide range of examples of mechanisms and solutions that can contribute to business model innovation for sustainability. The examples were collated and analysed to identify defining patterns and attributes that might facilitate categorisation.

Sustainable business model archetypes are introduced to describe groupings of mechanisms and solutions that may contribute to building up the business model for sustainability. The aim of these archetypes is to develop a common language that can be used to accelerate the development of sustainable business models in research and practice. The archetypes are: Maximise material and energy efficiency; Create value from 'waste'; Substitute with renewables and natural processes; Deliver functionality rather than ownership; Adopt a stewardship role; Encourage sufficiency; Re-purpose the business for society/environment; and Develop scale-up solutions.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2014","The literature and practice of innovations for sustainability is vast but fragmented, with various conceptual papers and many potential innovative approaches that may contribute to business model innovation for sustainability. This research proposes a categorisation of &quot;sustainable business model archetypes&quot; to unify these disparate contributions that deliver sustainability from the literature and practice under a common theme.

The archetypes aim to: Categorise and explain business model innovations for sustainability; Provide mechanisms to assist the innovation process for embedding sustainability in business models (e.g. through case studies and workshops); Define a clearer research agenda for business models for sustainability; and Provide exemplars for businesses to de-risk the SBM innovation process.

The eight archetypes developed are:
1.
Maximise material and energy efficiency

2.
Create value from 'waste'

3.
Substitute with renewables and natural processes

4.
Deliver functionality, rather than ownership

5.
Adopt a stewardship role

6.
Encourage sufficiency

7.
Re-purpose the business for society/environment

8.
Develop scale-up solutions


The sustainable business model archetypes are viewed as a starting point to broaden and unify the research agenda for sustainable business models.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652613008032","5aa653e5559754.90334829","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5aa653e5559754.90334829&grantRef=EP%2FI033351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I033351/1","55AB8CA6-FEC5-48D1-B3D8-13ED830934CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","68F9AC3F-225C-4FAD-A645-C2F5A9BBB85A"

The tool builds on existing peer-reviewed evidence relating to the links between the different activities in decommissioning, such as removing rigs and pipelines, and their environmental effects on the seabed, fishes, seabirds, etc. The tool includes the sensitivity of those ecological features, the marine processes which are required by them and the ecosystem services and societal benefits provided by protected features. For example, it was necessary to determine the effects of decommissioning on the seabed sediments, and in turn the seabed prey of fishes and the resulting fisheries. As such, underlying supporting evidence can be updated as and when it becomes available. The project development of the SPIDA tool relates to conservation features of the North Norfolk Sandbanks and Saturn Reefs SAC (i.e. sandbanks and reefs of the marine worm Sabellaria) however the modular structure of this database tool allows for additional features to be included and will permit its application to other industries. SPIDA has been designed to be flexible so it can also be adapted to a wide range of marine activities. For example, other designated features for MPAs of interest could be added and the tool could be readily adapted for application to other sectors (e.g. offshore wind, fisheries).
The knowledge translation and dissemination in the project, and especially the hands-on exercises in workshops involving industry and regulators, acted as continued professional development for those workers. By exposing stakeholders to recently-developed and novel ideas on marine science and management will enable more successful and sustainable solutions to an increasing environmental challenge.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2018","A number of future potential impacts of SPIDA have been identified and have been grouped here into short, medium and long term impacts.
Short term impacts include: The development and provision of the SPIDA tool to support industry and the Regulatory Authorities in their assessment of the best practical environmental option for decommissioning of oil and gas structures within or adjacent to MPAs in the Southern North Sea; current decommissioning applications within the North Norfolk Sandbanks and Saturn Reef SAC will be able to use the SPIDA tool as part of their assessments and the tool can be applied to other sites with the same features e.g. Haisborough, Hammond and Winterton SAC, Margate and Long Sands SAC. In addition, the strong links established with stakeholders and regulators which have been established as part of the DECOM-MPA project are currently being explored for further research collaboration; the stakeholders have expressed a willingness to take the approach further.
Medium term impacts include: the use of SPIDA could be explored for the assessment of decommissioning of other activities e.g. cables, offshore wind. As SPIDA provides an evidence-based transparent methodology for comparative assessment (spatially and temporally) for ongoing decommissioning, the Decision Support Framework could also be applied to decommissioning activities outside of UK waters. The DECOM-MPA outputs also provide a means of testing other frameworks and decision-making approaches for decommissioning of oil and gas structures within or adjacent to MPAs.
Long term impacts include: making the tool industry-compliant and required for use by regulators by its further development to increase its spatial applicability and increase its potential use as a decision-making tool rather than a decision-support tool. It is expected that the DECOM-MPA outputs could contribute to final adoption of decision-making approaches for decommissioning of oil and gas structures both within designated MPAs and in all similar marine areas. In this, the tool and approaches contribute to harmonising Maritime Spatial Planning and marine quality assessments and management (Elliott et al., in revision), to meeting the Government's 25 year Environment Plan and the meeting of the Sustainable Development Goal #14 (Cormier &amp; Elliott, 2017).",,"5aa900d2df73a5.61531400","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5aa900d2df73a5.61531400&grantRef=NE%2FP016553%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/P016553/1","44CDC530-9EE2-4157-BA30-1505117F3333","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","8A0FC07A-04CD-4F7A-9095-1D2E6C1D918F","F6D8FA87-F613-46AB-8059-522E5195AE8F"

The iFEED process begins with a participatory scenario workshop. In-country stakeholders identify two key drivers of food system change, and from these, four possible scenarios are defined. These scenarios provide the underlying narratives of change to the food system. Integrated modelling of climate change, food production and greenhouse gas emissions is then used to explore nutrition security and climate-smart agriculture outcomes for each scenario. Model results are summarised using calibrated statements - quantitative statements of model outcomes and our confidence in them. These include statements about the way in which different trade futures interact with climate change and domestic production in determining nutrition security at the national level.

To understand what the model results mean for food systems, the calibrated statements are then expanded upon using implication statements. The implications rely on input from a wide range of academic experts - including agro-ecologists and social scientists. A series of workshops are used to incorporate in-country expertise, identifying any gaps in knowledge and summarising information for country-level recommendations. iFEED stakeholder champions help throughout by providing in-country expertise and disseminating knowledge to policy makers.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2021","iFEED provides information to support evidence-based decisions for a climate-smart and nutrition-secure future. Modelling outputs include projections of food production, greenhouse gas emissions and soil organic carbon, and assessments of nutrition security for contrasting scenario. Implications are on topics including pests and diseases, water use, aflatoxins and the food system social content.

In particular, iFEED: i. employs novel and inclusive reporting of model results and associated in-country food system activities, with comprehensive reporting of uncertainty; ii. includes climate change mitigation alongside adaptation measures; and iii. quantifies future population-level nutrition security, as opposed to simply assessing future production and food security implications.

The iFEED website is used as a platform to disseminate iFEED results, making these available for policy-makers in each AFRICAP country.","https://ifeed.leeds.ac.uk/","61f2b0e39ecb63.11386131","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=61f2b0e39ecb63.11386131&grantRef=BB%2FP027784%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/P027784/1","A1FE9EE0-475D-488A-B713-CA811DFCF377","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","4F515F1C-8D08-4C7D-B535-4D17E94AFBB3"

Commercially available heated sonic anemometers are activated either continuously or based on a temperature threshold (e.x. 4.5&deg;C); as fall, winter and spring temperature are always below this value, the heating in these sonic anemometers biasing the sensible heat, and the flux calculation. To be able to activate the heating, we replaced this fixed threshoulds with a data quality threshold. The heater is coupled to the transducer for heating , an activation switch is configured to activate the heater when the measured quality of the collected data is less than a predetermined value. A deactivation switch is configured for deactivating the heater when the measured quality of the collected data reaches or exceeds the predetermined value. A status recording module is coupled to the data quality measurement module for indicating that the heater is heating the transducer. Heating of sonic anemometers is switched off automatically when not needed. Additionally, the increase in temperature of the bar of the sonic anemometer when heated continuously (and potential bias the data), is prevented when an intermittent heating is applied.

The automatic heating system we developed and further tested within the UAMS project allowed to extend measurements in remotely located sites that cannot easily be manually operated, and where power is limited. This system allowed performing unmanned temperature, wind, or other measurements in remote areas where ice and freezing conditions occur for substantial portions of the year by automatically heating and/or de-icing the instruments. By automatically and selectively heating scientific equipment such as a sonic anemometer, more accurate measurements were obtained from the sonic anemometer even when the sonic anemometer is located in a remote location, where measurements are typically or necessarily performed in unattended, unmanned ways. Further, required power for heating the equipment was reduced.

The automatic heating apparatus successfully de-iced the transducers of the sonic anemometer with minimal hours of activation, successfully reducing power consumption. Data recorded during the heating activations, as indicated by the automatic heating apparatus, were discarded, not affecting the final flux calculation.
This development and testing was conducted in the most remote of our sites, and proved successfully in maintaining ice-free the sonic anemomenter during the cold period dramatically improving the data coverage.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2017","The Arctic is undergoing warming twice that of the global average due to positive feedback loops involving snow and ice loss. This is resulting in shifting seasonality and altering greenhouse gas dynamics in tundra regions, where a large carbon reservoir exists in tundra soils. The effects of Arctic warming are most pronounced in the cold period (October - April). This is crucial as the cold period in Arctic tundra environments can account for half of annual emissions of methane (CH4), a powerful greenhouse gas with ~30 times the warming potential than that of carbon dioxide. The majority of cold season CH4 emissions occur in early winter, when soils are not completely frozen and temperatures hover around 0&deg; C during the transition from liquid to solid. This is referred to as the zero-curtain period. There is uncertainty regarding whether CH4 emissions during the zero-curtain period are due to active microbial production of CH4 or merely the result of CH4 escaping that was generated during the prior summer season. Our study suggests that substantial CH4 occurs during the zero-curtain period, representing an important component of the annual budget.The ability to extend the flux measurements during the cold period is critical to develop better predictions of the impact of global warming on the Arctic carbon balance.",,"62324ef4e58d01.34378162","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=62324ef4e58d01.34378162&grantRef=NE%2FP003028%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/P003028/1","17768A8D-FF28-49E3-84EE-E103AE5BE58E","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","943FEA7C-8F21-4565-B579-8359A7C3CCA1"

It includes modelling results from the first national infrastructure long term planning tool, created under the first phase of the ITRC, and currently being utilised to inform a national infrastructure needs assessment for the National Infrastructure Commission.

It has attracted academic interest globally as a research tool to model infrastructure futures and resilience and their impact. 

 The NISMOD platform is made up of four sections: NISMOD-LP - Long term performance of interdependent infrastructure systems Integrated engineering-based simulation models of demand and capacity for infrastructure services in the energy, transport, water, waste water, and solid waste sectors of Great Britain's National Infrastructure system. Links between the sectors are included through cross-sectoral demand for services, e.g. energy generation requires water, waste water treatment requires energy, etc. The interconnected simulation models are run from a single input framework and a single database (NISMOD-DB), acting as an repository for both the model inputs and outputs and as the reporting warehouse and post-processing facility. NISMOD-LP allows the assessment of national cross-sectoral strategies for infrastructure provision based upon a multi-dimensional performance metric, including cost of service, carbon intensity, supply security, etc. NISMOD-RV- Risks and vulnerability in national infrastructure systems A detailed hierarchical representation of the real-world assets and networks of the energy, transport, and water infrastructure sectors. Stochastic climate projections and hydrological modelling derive profiles of natural hazards such as storms and floods that threaten infrastructure assets and systems. A risk analysis framework uses the profiles to examine the robustness and vulnerability of existing and hypothetical configurations of national infrastructure networks. NISMOD-RV allows assessing different national strategies for infrastructure provision based on their risk-footprint under climate change. NISMOD-RD- Regional development and how it adapts to infrastructure provision A generic representation of national infrastructure systems as networks, assisting the transport of resources, goods, services, people, and the externalities of economic activity, allowing for further integration of different infrastructure sectors. The generic representation is integrated into a meso-scale model of economic growth and development to assess the role of infrastructure for growth. A spatial interaction model to assess the impact of infrastructure performance on local attractiveness for migration. Combining these approaches ,can simulate the co-evolution of the socio-economic and the national infrastructure system. NISMOD-DB - Infrastructure networks, demand and performance Combines hundreds of data layers on Great Britain's infrastructure systems within a spatial database framework (using open source languages). A scenario and output repository for the NISMOD-LP and NISMOD-RV models. Includes nnovative algorithms for the identification and synthesis of national scale infrastructure networks from incomplete and unstructured maps. NISMOD-INT - A generic framework for international applications of NISMOD A series of open-source analysis tools known for the application of evidence-based decision making in a diverse range of possible international settings. Providing recipient countries with the capacity to develop and assess alternative infrastructure transition strategies for meeting their future sustainable development goals. Capable of combining rapidly emerging global datasets with country-specific engineering insights and on-the-ground assessments.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2014","The NISMOD suite of tools has generated circa 200 publications and is recognised as a poneering work globally. The following organisations/ agencies have been utilizing the NISMOD tools as an analytical framework to inform their decision-making processes: 1- National Needs Assessment The National Needs Assessment (NNA) was an Institution of Civil Engineers initiative to examine the UK's likely infrastructure needs in the coming decades - set against uncertainties such as climate change, population growth, global energy prices and economic change. It also looked at the way infrastructure networks relate to, and depend on, one another and how this will impact on the performance of networks in the future. We provided the primary evidence for the NNA through our modelling framework for analysing the relationships between and among infrastructure networks. Our scenarios set out the main demand drivers on infrastructure - population growth, climate change, technology, economic trends. The National Needs Assessment sets out a vision for how infrastructure delivers economic growth, thriving communities and embraces technology to deliver a low carbon future. It is a blueprint for the National Infrastructure Commission's (NIC) long term infrastructure assessment. 2- United Nations Office for Project Services Working with the Government of Norway, ITRC and UNOPS, an operational arm of the United Nations, we are pioneering modelling tools, support and guidance to governments to enable robust future planning on national infrastructure. The tools will include assistance for long-term planning, focused for development projects, and designed to allow governments to efficiently use existing assets, prioritise new projects, and use financial resources to deliver maximum socio-economic benefits to local communities. 5- National Grid - spatial modelling for Future Energy Scenarios National Grid used the NISMOD tool to forecast use of of renewable technologies, embedded generation capacities and customer demand projections in the long-term. National Grid needed an analysis tool to: integrate different data sources assign transmission and distribution level assets to key renewable technologies (such as solar, wind and photovoltaic installations) aggregate outputs from distribution regions to the grid. The output was used with National Grid's own Future Energy Scenarios forecasting models to provide a demand allocation, by area, for different technologies and scenarios. 4- JBA Trust - bridge scour analysis JBA Trust looked at probabilistic scenarios for railway bridge failure due to extreme floods. Our team used the NISMOD-RV software to build demand loss estimates for these different failure scenarios to produce a flood risk analysis for railway infrastructure. Our work with JBA Trust produced recommendations to Network Rail on their network asset management plans. 5 - Infrastructure UK (IUK), UK Treasury The'hotspot' analysis identified critical infrastructure locations (pdf, 200 KB), measured by the number of directly or indirectly dependent customers for Infrastructure UK (IUK), a unit within HM Treasury. Through an extensive database of details from interdependent networks, we examined the nation-wide crisis points of individual infrastructures.

Uncaptured value exists in almost all companies. Some uncaptured value is visible, e.g. waste streams in production, co-products, under-utilised resources, and reusable components of broken products; some is invisible, e.g. over capacity of labour, insufficient use of expertise and knowledge. Reducing any kind of the uncaptured value would create sustainable value. However, identifying the uncaptured value and creating value from it is not always easy. The tool supports this process, providing companies with a scheme to systematically look for each form of value uncaptured (i.e. value surplus, value absence, value destroyed and value missed) at the beginning, middle and end of the product life cycle, and with a method to turn the identified value uncaptured into value opportunities. The SVAT has been well received in 25 manufacturing companies across various sectors and of various sizes. It helped them find opportunities to create value internally and to discover the potential of creating mutual value externally.

The tool uses a habitat-based approach to provide a common and consistent means of considering the direct impact of land use change across 18 ecosystem service services.

It has been developed by Natural England and the University of Oxford in partnership with Defra, the Forestry Commission and the Environment Agency to support Government's 25 Year Environment Plan commitment to expand net gain approaches to include wider Natural Capital benefits such as flood protection, recreation and improved water and air quality.

The terms natural capital, ecosystem services, green infrastructure and net gain now form an integral part of a complex and ever-growing environmental vocabulary in England. They all feature in key national guidance and strategies (e.g. HM Government 25 Year Environment Plan; MHCLG (2018) National Planning Policy Framework), but lack definitional clarity and integrated guidance[1]. Consequently, we see ad hoc and uncritical use in policy and practice. Furthermore, the environmental vocabulary differs significantly in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, hindering more integrated approaches to environmental planning across the UK. This becomes significant as we develop our national environmental governance frameworks post-Brexit.

Understanding this vocabulary and optimising its potential application in policy and practice poses significant challenges for stakeholders including the public. First, there is the need to understand each term individually. Second, we then need to apply them in policy and practice, set within the constraints and opportunities of existing governance frameworks. Third, we need to understand how these individual terms relate to each other to aid mainstreaming the environment in policy and decision-making processes in economic and social policy and practice arenas. This is not straightforward as the terms were introduced at different times for different purposes and thus were never explicitly designed to work together.

So, the purpose of this briefing note is to understand how green infrastructure, natural capital, ecosystem services and net gain can contribute collectively to what a good environment looks like; specifically, how this technocratic, expert-led language can be better mainstreamed into a common framework for both policy and practice so that (urban) land management and development delivers more and better environmental and social benefits.

The note is structured in the following way. First, we provide a non-technical introduction to each term set within its historical roots, rationale and intended purpose. Second, we identify a set of common principles linking them together. Third, we develop a conceptual diagram with a supporting narrative showing the linkages and interrelationships and finally augment this with respect to the influence of the planning system.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2020","Used to inform West of Englands GI strategy.

Co-designing a teaching programme is an effective means of both complementing local curricula and ensuring continued buy-in of local stakeholders (i.e., teachers). Student engagement depends on the local relevance of teaching materials, with more holistic or global concepts, such as climate change of lesser importance. Our activity focused on rainfall, including student-led data collection.

Could your current business model be actively destroying value for others, ultimately affecting the organisation's ability to capture value in the long run? Answers to these questions and more are explored using three powerful innovation tools which make up the Sustainable Business Models Suite: Cambridge Value Mapping Tool, Sustainable Value Analysis Tool, and Business Transformation Tool. Together these tools enable new perspectives on value forms - missed, destroyed, surplus and absence and provide a structured approach to discover failed value exchanges among stakeholders and an organised method for implementing sustainable change in a business. The Sustainable Business Model Suite is used through workshops to help practitioners who want to gain a more complete understanding of the economic, social, and environmental value created by a business, and to explore opportunities for transforming the current business model towards a more sustainable one. The tools can be adapted to the size and complexity of the business from new start-ups to established multinationals.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2014","Sustainable Business Models Suite has been used extensively in workshops and in companies.",,"563875da9f17d4.83297147","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=563875da9f17d4.83297147&grantRef=EP%2FI033351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I033351/1","55AB8CA6-FEC5-48D1-B3D8-13ED830934CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","68F9AC3F-225C-4FAD-A645-C2F5A9BBB85A"

Of the distributed sources, renewable energy sources such as the wind and solar energy are uncontrollable, whilst distributed generators such as diesel generators, micro turbine and fuel cells which are controllable. Microgrid also includes fixed storage devices such as stationary battery banks or mobile storage devices such as electric vehicle (EV) batteries. In addition, it has controllable loads that can be curtailed to prevent the system from outages. Microgrid can operate either autonomously in an isolated mode, or linked to the utility grid in connected mode. In both operational modes, microgrid has to maintain stability and meet local loading demands. The increasing penetration of these new energy sources with distinctive operational features creates many challenges in various aspects, and in particular the optimal management of power flow within the microgrid. 

Scheduling strategies based on the optimised power flow in the microgrid are developed. The integration of EVs under different operational and environmental conditions are investigated, and different charging and discharging approaches have been carried out. 
The proposed approaches are tested on typical low voltage connected and isolated modes microgrids. It is shown that the EVs represent an interesting dynamics between the energy sources and loads. Suitable dispatching and scheduling of the EVs will have an important impact on the stability and efficiency of the microgrid.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","The outcome provide technology and knowledge to maximize the use of EV as distributed energy storage.",,"56d8c3b50a57d0.74339306","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56d8c3b50a57d0.74339306&grantRef=EP%2FL001063%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/L001063/1","34FFD228-2F72-461E-AD54-A92D2D826225","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","EC23DA53-CA73-4104-A3F6-2A9523484E69","805BF1A0-B634-4558-BA5E-9CB38293A4AC"

accuracies and for both overall accuracy and area error are calculated using the Wilson Score method and Jeffrey

The MSc abstract follows: With the incentive for the occupation of the Brazilian Amazon in end of the 60s, forest areas suffered from anthropic interferences. Between 1988 and 2004 there was an intensification of the deforestation within the Legal Amazon. Based on the panorama of deforestation and on the growing international concern about greenhouse gas emissions, Brazil launched the Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) with the objective of reducing deforestation rates. This plan was focused on a list of priority municipalities, which was based on deforestation rates, for greater control and inspection. Since then, the reducing greenhouse gas emissions policies in Brazil have been focusing on efforts to reduce deforestation rates, leaving the contributions from other emission sources, such as forest degradation by fires and logging implicit. The objective of this study was to estimate a carbon dioxide emission from three processes (deforestation, fire and degradation) for the 2008-2012 period in the municipalities within the Legal Amazon to generate a new metric to indicate priority municipalities. Thirty-one municipalities within the Amazon region were highlighted. Six municipalities have a greater contribution to the deforestation, 21 due to fires, and 4 due to degradation. Between 2008 and 2012 a total of 3.88 Gt CO2 was emitted from deforestation, burning and fires and degradation in the Amazon. From these values, 45.5% were driven by the fires of 2010. This result shows that in years of extreme droughts, fires emit more CO2 than the deforestation and should be also considered when defining priority areas for policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",,"58c81be545d035.24686291","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c81be545d035.24686291&grantRef=NE%2FF005776%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/F005776/1","E231895C-49EE-438D-A72C-4381E631E51F","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","8103EC83-199F-418D-9160-D7BDD919696D"

This helps overcome the first barriers to implementation and gain momentum for more advanced activities. The toolkit helps identify improvements, strengths and weaknesses through examples of good practices and sustainable manufacturing models, assess current practice maturity (qualitative) and develop performance indicators (quantitative). The FREE toolkit also provides a strong framework on which companies can develop their own approach to eco-efficiency: as companies understand how eco-efficiency fits into their operations, they can customise their use of the FREE toolkit to match their specific needs. It can be used internally or across supply chains.

The tools are mapped against five key elements for eco-efficiency:
1) See waste. What is your waste worth? Learn to identify waste in your factory.
2) Find solutions. How can you remedy it? Finding quick wins to more advanced tactics for resource efficiency.
3) Set targets. What's the size of the prize? Determine potential benefits and set targets.
4) Assess yourself. Where are you now? Establish current performance and benchmarking.

- Although business models that deliver sustainability are increasingly popular in the literature, few tools that assist in sustainable business modelling have been identified. This paper investigates how businesses might create balanced social, environmental and economic value through integrating sustainability more fully into the core of their business. A value mapping tool is developed to help firms create value propositions better suited for sustainability.

Design/methodology/approach
- In addition to a literature review, six sustainable companies were interviewed to understand their approaches to business modelling, using a case study approach. Building on the literature and practice, a tool was developed which was pilot tested through use in a workshop. The resulting improved tool and process was subsequently refined through use in 13 workshops.

Findings
- A novel value mapping tool was developed to support sustainable business modelling, which introduces three forms of value (value captured, missed/destroyed or wasted, and opportunity) and four major stakeholder groups (environment, society, customer, and network actors).

Originality/value
- The tool adopts a multiple stakeholder view of value, a network rather than firm centric perspective, and introduces a novel way of conceptualising value that specifically introduces value destroyed or wasted/ missed, in addition to the current value proposition and new opportunities for value creation.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2013","Practical implications
- This tool intends to support business modelling for sustainability by assisting firms in better understanding their overall value proposition, both positive and negative, for all relevant stakeholders in the value network.","https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/CG-06-2013-0078","5aa652b92e04b3.40553063","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5aa652b92e04b3.40553063&grantRef=EP%2FI033351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I033351/1","55AB8CA6-FEC5-48D1-B3D8-13ED830934CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","68F9AC3F-225C-4FAD-A645-C2F5A9BBB85A"

We have applied a simple method for mapping ecosystem services within the Bicester area using a land-use scoring system. Different land-use types (e.g. broadleaved woodland; arable; improved grassland; etc) were assigned scores on a scale of 1 to 5 to reflect their ability to deliver each of 20 different ecosystem services. The scores can then be used to generate maps for each ecosystem service, allowing quick and simple visualisation of the areas of good supply and the gaps in supply. Scores were initially assigned based on a workshop of local experts in an adjacent area (Warwickshire), but were reviewed and adjusted for application to the Bicester area. Although this scoring method was pioneered by a German research group (Burkhard et al 2012, Mapping ecosystem service supply, demand and budgets. Ecological Indicators 21:17-29), we have extended it by using a systematic literature review of 780 papers on the links between natural capital and ecosystem services to inform an expert review of the scores, improving the consistency and the scientific basis for the scoring. This expert knowledge was also used to develop scores for new land use categories to cover the range of different types of Green Infrastructure present in Bicester (e.g. playing fields, churchyards, grass verges).","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","","The project partners are interested in taking this further, but it is still at an early stage.",,"58b5966c7c2522.63156275","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58b5966c7c2522.63156275&grantRef=NE%2FN017730%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/N017730/1","B6D20327-97A9-428F-B6FC-D8AA12D48A1B","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","7F014281-39E2-4054-9997-4DD3B6BD1CB4"

&quot;integrated conceptual framework of Drivers (compulsion, incentives, information), Filters and Impact pathways. Derived from a synthesis of the food systems, food environment, entrepreneurship, agricultural innovation, institutions and livelihoods literature, it seeks to encapsulate the complexity of supply and demand side interlinkages between nutritional outcomes and agricultural production; processing; storage; markets (pricing; distribution; promotion) and consumption (preparation; cooking; education) by encompassing the multiple dimensions of food security and nutrition (availability; accessibility; affordability; desirability; and sustainability). This encourages supply side interventions to look beyond production and recognises that technical interventions to address 'information deficits' on the demand side may improve dietary awareness but may ignore other prevailing binding choice constraints.

Due to the inherent difficulty involved in distinguishing between plant and soil C fluxes under natural environmental conditions most studies assessing rhizosphere priming have been short-term and lab- or pot-based. Our method uses large (0.8 m diameter, 1 m deep) lysimeters containing two C3 soils and sown with a C4 grass (Bouteloua dactyloides), using differences in the C isotope ratios of CO2 produced by C4 plant respiration and C3 SOM decomposition to partition net C fluxes. Previous studies under field conditions have struggled to separate these fluxes as differences between plant and SOM isotope ratios are small. Using a novel C3 to C4 plant change allows us to exploit differences in C isotope fractionation between these two photosynthetic pathways to create a larger distinction. 

Gas flux measurements are made thrice daily from 24 planted lysimeters using cavity ring-down spectroscopy, using an automated system which allowed us to continually monitor fluxes for over 6 months. Flux measurements have been coupled with near-continuous soil moisture and temperature measurements at multiple depths. We have demonstrated that this system enables successful partitioning of soil and plant C fluxes under field conditions. Results from the initial growing season show clear patterns to both plant and soil C dynamics at both diurnal and seasonal timescales.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2018","This research method and setup enables the generation of field-scale datasets of seperated plant and soil respiration fluxes.

More specifically, to model air quality we used the VBS version 5.0.2 CMAQ (Community Multi-scale Air Quality) model (1), coupled to ADMS (2), a model we describe as CMAQ-Urban (3), which outputs hourly air pollution concentrations across Europe every 50km, the UK every 10km, and in London, initially every 2km and every 20m close to roads. The CMAQ-urban outputs were: NOX, NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5.

Bias in the 2x2km CMAQ PM2.5 and PM10&not; hourly output was corrected using a sample of background sites before the local scale dispersion modelling stage. The discrepancies between the model output and the measurements at a random sample of 50% of background sites in the case of PM10&not;, and 5 sites in the case of PM2.5, was interpolated onto the 2x2km grid to create a correction surface. This interpolation was done using two iterations of a multilevel B-spline algorithm (4), which normally takes around eight iterations to interpolate points exactly, so that the resultant error surface provided smoothly varying bias correction across the domain, rather than fixing the model output to the measurements.

Current regulation by the EU water framework directive (European Union, 2000/60/EC) relates to organic pollution by monitoring selected micropollutants, however, aquatic ecosystem responses requires a comprehensive understanding of dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition. The introduction of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is set to greatly increase our understanding of the composition of DOM of both natural and anthropogenic origin derived from diffuse and point sources. 

METHOD: DOM was extracted from riverine and treated sewage effluent using solid phase extraction (SPE) and analysed using dissolved organic carbon analysis, direct infusion-high resolution mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) and high-performance liquid chromatography/HRMS (HPLC/HRMS). The data obtained were analysed using univariate and multivariate statistics to demonstrate differences in background DOM, anthropogenic inputs and in-river mixing. Compound identifications were achieved based on MS2 spectra searched against on-line databases.

RESULTS: DI-HRMS spectra showed the highly complex nature of all DOM SPE extracts. Classification and visualisation of extracts containing many thousands of individual compounds were achieved using PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis. Kruskal-Wallis analyses highlighted significant discriminating ions originating from the sewage treatment works for more in-depth investigation by HPLC/HRMS. The generation of MS spectra in HPLC/HRMS provided the basis for identification of anthropogenic compounds including; pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, metabolites and polymers, although many thousands of compounds remain unidentified.

CONCLUSIONS: This new approach enables comprehensive analysis of DOM in extracts without any preconceived ideas of the compounds which may be present. This approach has the potential to be used as a high throughput, qualitative, screening method to determine if the composition of point sources differs from that of the receiving water bodies, providing a new approach to the identification of hitherto unrecognised organic contribution to water bodies","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2020","The capacity for comprehensive determination of DOM composition in environmental samples.",,"5e66d083221b17.11181221","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e66d083221b17.11181221&grantRef=NE%2FK010689%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K010689/1","C2E859B5-8451-42A3-8ACE-B587117C3473","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","F3755C41-62CB-439D-959A-2B52F747D106"

Crucially, it allows sequential analysis of samples and flexible inclusion of current data in later analyses without completely confounding the analysis.

I have chosen the least worst one, but clearly ResearchFish should be diversified to be inclusive for tools and methods developed in other disciplines! The transition to a circular economy, where the value of resources is preserved in the technosphere, must be supported by policies and operational decision-making based on evidence. Existing methods used to provide this evidence (e.g. LCA, LCSA, CBA) are not robust enough to adequately address the creation and dissipation of systemic and multidimensional value that spans the social, environmental, economic and technical domains. This study proposes a novel, conceptual approach that seeks to assess how complex value is created, destroyed and distributed in resource recovery from waste systems. This approach expands beyond conventional methods of estimating value. It combines scientific and engineering methods with a socio-political narrative grounded in the systems of provision (sop) approach, and provides a comprehensive, analytical framework for making the transition to a resource-efficient future. This framework has the potential to connect bottom-up and top-down approaches in assessing resource recovery from waste systems, and address systemic challenges through transparency and flexibility, while accounting for the dynamic and non-linear nature of commodities flow and infrastructure provision in the overall system. This creates the pathway towards circular economy, and lays the foundations for future advances in computational and assessment methodologies in the field of RRfW.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2017","The CVORR approach has been received with a great interest from e.g. Innovate UK and Defra, as well as academics around the world.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652617319893","5e62b890977467.34893194","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e62b890977467.34893194&grantRef=NE%2FL014149%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L014149/1","FF7802D3-E2D2-4329-B310-02174DEE5A26","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","20C41513-4169-4544-AAC7-D255A0731E24"

During ReDAPT, a 1 MW commercial prototype tidal turbine was deployed and operated at the Fall of Warness tidal test site within the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), Orkney, U.K. Mean flow speeds and Turbulence Intensity (TI) at multiple positions proximal to the machine are considered. Through the implemented wave identification techniques, the dataset can be filtered into conditions where the effects of waves are present or absent. Due to the volume of results, only flow conditions in the absence of waves are reported here. The analysis shows that TI and mean flows are found to vary considerably between flood and ebb tides whilst exhibiting sensitivity to the tidal phase and to the specification of spatial averaging and velocity binning. The principal measurement technique was acoustic Doppler profiling provided by seabed-mounted Diverging-beam Acoustic Doppler Profilers (D-ADP) together with remotely-operable Single-Beam Acoustic Doppler Profilers (SB-ADP) installed at mid-depth on the tidal turbine. This novel configuration allows inter-instrument comparisons, which were conducted. Turbulence intensity averaged over the rotor extents of the ReDAPT turbine for flood tides vary between 16.7% at flow speeds above 0.3 m/s and 11.7% when considering only flow speeds in the turbine operating speed range, which reduces to 10.9% (6.8% relative reduction) following the implementation of noise correction techniques. Equivalent values for ebb tides are 14.7%, 10.1% and 9.3% (7.9% relative reduction). For flood and ebb tides, TI values resulting from noise correction are reduced in absolute terms by 3% and 2% respectively across a wide velocity range and approximately 1% for turbine operating speeds. Through comparison with SB-ADP-derived mid-depth TI values, this correction is shown to be conservative since uncorrected SB-ADP results remain, in relative terms, between 10% and 21% below corrected D-ADP values depending on tidal direction and the range of velocities considered. Results derived from other regions of the water column, those important to floating turbine devices for example, are reported for comparison.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2018","This article is about characterizing turbulent intensities and specifying defined values to different tidal current conditions.

The CABANA baseline questionnaire conducted in April 2018 provides a snapshot of the state of affairs in 2017 in bioinformatics and computational biology in nine Latin American academic research institutions in Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Brazil. It is one of several tools developed to track progress towards CABANA's two higher-level objectives:
(1) Partner institutions (have developed a critical mass of bioinformaticians and scientists able to) conduct collaborative Pan-Latin American bioinformatics research at the highest international level in infectious diseases, food security and biodiversity.
(2) &quot;A pan-Latin American and sustainable capacity-building programme for bioinformatics research operates with at least 6 partner institutions. 
The baseline questionnaire confirms the need for additional resources for bioinformatics and computational biology in Latin America and the need for additional capacity building. It identifies a shortage of local trainers and suggests a need for increased cross-border and international collaboration.
CABANA's partner countries fall broadly into a relatively well-resourced group (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico) and a more poorly resourced group (Peru, Costa Rica). However, the results of the baseline questionnaire suggest that all nine institutions have a unique constellation of strengths, weaknesses, stakeholders, and capacity-strengthening needs. CABANA must be receptive and responsive to these differing needs and remain a truly collaborative partnership for the best and most sustained impact.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","The project partners have developed an understanding of the current state of affairs in its 9 partner institutions.

Discussions led to greater awareness of:

- Changing rainfall patterns, and effects on farming practices.
- The potential misunderstanding that can arise from different meanings attached to the same concept. For example, mitigation can mean reducing the impact of flooding (mitigating climate risk) or reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigating climate change).
- The reasons for uncertainties about future climate projections. Projections from different climate models produce different results.
- The need for a change of mindset, away from working in silos towards a transdisciplinary approach. For example, isolated mitigation or adaptation projects often benefit from holistic evaluation of measures that offer potential to support both.
- The co-benefits of some strategies and actions. For example, planting trees sequesters carbon (climate change mitigation); reduces flooding impacts (disaster risk reduction/ adaptation); and moderates local temperatures and minimises soil degradation (adaptation).","https://www.sei.org/publications/game-play-to-address-climate-change-adaptation/","5e60c79053fe05.01982235","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e60c79053fe05.01982235&grantRef=NE%2FM020355%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M020355/1","BDC350BE-0EFF-4830-A0CE-6C8293FE77DB","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","104C9D71-D2B9-4DD3-9F24-229634DCBAC0","D52CE165-AB8C-432B-BE94-ACD2E22D1433"

It identifies a shortage of local trainers and suggests a need for increased cross-border and international collaboration. CABANA's partner countries fall broadly into a relatively well-resourced group (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico) and a more poorly resourced group (Peru, Costa Rica). However, the results of the baseline questionnaire suggest that all nine institutions have a unique constellation of strengths, weaknesses, stakeholders, and capacity-strengthening needs. CABANA must be receptive and responsive to these differing needs and remain a truly collaborative partnership for the best and most sustained impact.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2020","The questionnaire informs the 9 project partners of current trends in funding and project outputs and enables the team to adjust the projects capacity building activities accordingly.",,"6231c90c60bc91.57542152","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=6231c90c60bc91.57542152&grantRef=BB%2FP027849%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/P027849/1","8D80ADAA-F10B-4077-ACD6-8CDA2910554F","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","9A22541F-DA58-481E-8D0C-C4BCF4EA030E","3334C653-A094-4CBE-9987-7D65C7AF5995"

Soil spectroscopy is a fast, cost-effective and environmental-friendly technique that uses the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with soils to estimate soil properties such as the levels of acidity, organic carbon, nitrogen and water retention. These determine the health and usability of these soils.
The initial collection for the library contains high-quality soil spectral reflectance and measured data for over 80 000 soil samples. Spectral reflectance measures how much energy (as a percentage) a soil surface reflects at a specific wavelength, which is then used to identify different soil properties. From this, a soil's condition and quality can be analysed.

This library will continue to grow as participating countries provide samples for spectral and conventional analysis, meaning countries can use this data to rapidly characterize their soil conditions and help protect them.

This centralised and standardised spectral reflectance library will be freely available to laboratories around the world. In addition, the library will soon support a free and easy-to-use soil property estimation service where users can submit their soil spectral data and come out with a suite of estimated soil conditions and properties.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2021","Help countries understand soil conditions to improve agricultural productivity and reverse land degradation

Engaged research facilitates relationship-building among project researchers and stakeholders, who are the beneficiaries. The stakeholders include local residents and communities, non-governmental organisations, civil society, private enterprise, and formal water management institutions at all levels of government. 

The ASA steps ensure stakeholder benefit: 
Step 1. As each Case Study is BOUND, the researchers' team and stakeholders decide on the problem scope. This means stakeholders have clear, realistic expectations of project benefits, and reduces the risk of extractive research. 

Step 2. In the ADAPTIVE PLANNING PROCESS, stakeholders recognise they have a shared future, and collectively build a vision of resolving the selected water problem, and a pathway to reach that desired future. Thus, benefits of addressing the problem in a clear agreed manner, using research expertise, are formally agreed. Indicators of progress are agreed, embedding accountability. 

Step 3 involves concurrent processes: 
3.1 The RESEARCH activities that will provide findings to address the problem. 
3.2 PARTICPATORY GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENT is the focused process of linking local people facing the problem, with the people mandated to manage the problem. 
3.3 STRATEGIC ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT is an essential tool for stakeholders, because the context of complex problems changes through time, and there are multiple causal loops. This tool provides a mechanism for responsively moving towards the agreed desired future. 

Step 4. In PARTICIPATORY MONITORING AND EVALUATION FOR REFLEXIVE LEARNING, both researchers and stakeholders monitor the indicators selected in Step 2. At each project engagement, participants reflect on and learn from progress in terms of these indicators. When local people &quot;own&quot; the process of positive change the chances are local people will continue to collaborate accountably after the project.

The ASA methodology has been adapted during the current Research Excellence grant due to issues related to COVID-19. This is one of the strengths of this methodology.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","No","2019","The ASA methodology is in the process of review and should be published in a peer-reviewed journal in the upcoming year.

The annual review process has been merged into one report which tracks the progress of the project from its baseline report in 2018 to the final report in 2021. It is planned that the annual review process will continue each year for the foreseeable future. It is one of several tools developed to track progress towards CABANA's two higher-level objectives: (1) Partner institutions (have developed a critical mass of bioinformaticians and scientists able to) conduct collaborative Pan-Latin American bioinformatics research at the highest international level in infectious diseases, food security and biodiversity. (2) &quot;A pan-Latin American and sustainable capacity-building programme for bioinformatics research operates with at least 6 partner institutions.

A programme of tactile condition surveys on over 200 properties will assess the extent of deterioration of high-level masonry and ensure public safety against the risk of potentially unstable building fabric. It will mean that access to some properties will be restricted to enable surveys to be conducted.

Scotland's public heritage body, which cares for 336 historic buildings and sites across Scotland, believes the programme is a proactive step towards transforming the way the nation's most precious places are protected, repaired and experienced in the face of accelerating decay from climate change.

The tactile survey programme, which is the result of ongoing risk assessment and sample surveys, will assess the impact of climate change, as well as the scale of deterioration caused by a number of other factors, including the materials used in the building's construction, its age and physical location. It is anticipated remedial works could require significant investment over multiple years and, in some instances, require a different management approach to be taken than before.

Underpinning this programme, scientific analysis of stone and mortar using the X-Ray diffraction instrument procured via the CapCo funding stream will allow for the production of robust datasets of stone and mortar typologies to support and inform conservation decision making.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2022","Too early to measure impact.","https://www.historicenvironment.scot/about-us/news/new-measures-introduced-to-manage-the-impact-of-climate-change/","62028f0f440657.21811940","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=62028f0f440657.21811940&grantRef=AH%2FV012088%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/V012088/1","C48F3ADE-00E9-4460-9699-7646D9593760","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","70EEB1A2-4E8C-45D6-881A-2DD01F8CE983","13CBF3A6-E102-426A-90D1-68FD6BE9270B"

Critical behaviour in charging of electric vehicles. New Journal of Physics 17(9): 095001.

Carvalho continued his work on using utility functions that were developed for fairness of flows for infrastructure networks to that of the charging vehicles. 

His abstract reads:
The increasing penetration of electric vehicles over the coming decades, taken together with the high cost to upgrade local distribution networks and consumer demand for home charging, suggest that managing congestion on low voltage networks will be a crucial component of the electric vehicle revolution and the move away from fossil fuels in transportation. Here, we model the max-flow and proportional fairness protocols for the control of congestion caused by a fleet of vehicles charging on two real-world distribution networks. We show that the system undergoes a continuous phase transition to a congested state as a function of the rate of vehicles plugging to the network to charge. We focus on the order parameter and its fluctuations close to the phase transition, and show that the critical point depends on the choice of congestion protocol. Finally, we analyse the inequality in the charging times as the vehicle arrival rate increases, and show that charging times are considerably more equitable in proportional fairness than in max-flow.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","","None so far.","http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/17/9/095001/meta","58b578e648bfe4.22573034","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58b578e648bfe4.22573034&grantRef=EP%2FH04812X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/H04812X/1","5B33C199-3792-4635-BE0A-6206FA1B2FAE","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D5337A10-AC8A-402A-8164-C5F9CC6B0140","4DD84CA9-1CBA-484A-9C9E-BADA633AADD6"

Soil spectroscopy is a fast, cost-effective and environmental-friendly technique that uses the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with soils to estimate soil properties such as the levels of acidity, organic carbon, nitrogen and water retention. These determine the health and usability of these soils.
The initial collection for the library contains high-quality soil spectral reflectance and measured data for over 80 000 soil samples. Spectral reflectance measures how much energy (as a percentage) a soil surface reflects at a specific wavelength, which is then used to identify different soil properties. From this, a soil's condition and quality can be analysed.

This library will continue to grow as participating countries provide samples for spectral and conventional analysis, meaning countries can use this data to rapidly characterize their soil conditions and help protect them.

This centralised and standardised spectral reflectance library will be freely available to laboratories around the world. In addition, the library will soon support a free and easy-to-use soil property estimation service where users can submit their soil spectral data and come out with a suite of estimated soil conditions and properties.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2021","Help countries understand soil conditions to improve agricultural productivity and reverse land degradation

The development of the design and fabrication tool has enabled the successful manufacture of concrete shell segments by the research team based in Cambridge, led by CSIC Investigator Dr John Orr, and the successful construction of a full-sized 4.5 m x 4.5 m 'thin shell' vaulted floor slab demonstration with 60% less embodied carbon than an equivalent flat slab.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2022","The robot-manufactured new vaulted style of floor, which uses 75% less concrete than a traditional slab floor is featured in the RIBA Journal in an article presenting the engineering behind the project and ACORN's approach that &quot;could be the secret to unlocking net zero buildings&quot;.

In rethinking the way concrete is used in buildings, ACORN combines offsite manufacturing processes, affordable robotics and a highly-automated, quality-controlled environment to help design concrete out of construction - only using concrete where it is needed. The traditional approach to pre-casting prism-shaped concrete slabs has not changed since Roman times and while this method offers highly repeatable results it creates waste and is not carbon efficient. New approaches to concrete use and manufacture are needed and the value of them evidenced to encourage a change of culture in the construction industry and adoption at scale.

&quot;Achieving the net-zero targets recently ratified at the COP26 conference will require significant change by the construction industry, which is responsible for about half of the UK's total emissions. Since concrete is the world's most widely consumed material after water, and its production contributes more than 7% of global CO2 emissions, the easiest way for construction to begin its journey to net-zero is to use less concrete. That has been the driving force behind this project, which we hope could make a major difference to the impact of construction,&quot; said Dr Shepherd.

With this demonstrator and the release of an end-to-end design and fabrication tool, the research fuses the digital and physical realms and hopes to drive the acceptance of a new culture in the construction industry, to use enough material - and no more.","https://automated.construction/","622897592bc897.89402655","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=622897592bc897.89402655&grantRef=EP%2FP013848%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/P013848/1","8265374F-695C-4175-B96F-5F26B57BFCC2","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","BEA6522D-2216-4F01-A947-C88959B03F24"

The method often results in the creation of collaborations, partnerships as well as the development of internally or externally funded projects. The process is delivered through workshops or as a programme of interactions and it has been associated with various materials to facilitate the delivery of these events.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2015","The cross-pollination approach has been used and it is still used by a number of organisations. Here we present some notable examples: A) Silent Cities, one of the CSOs that took part in the project proposed co-design concepts and practices that were part of the cross-pollination strategy to the South Yorkshire Housing Association (SYHA) as tools for tackling isolation of elderly people. This collaboration grew independently from the project and led to the creation of a toolkit that was a core component in a successful Big Lottery bid. The cross-pollination concept and methods thus leveraged almost &pound;6m to tackle isolation among the elderly in Sheffield. The toolkit was shared with organisations across Sheffield who support older people. Over 40 organisations have implemented the co-design based toolkit and 43,000 toolkits will be disseminated reaching an estimate of 12,000 elderly people. B) The Glass-House Community Led Design is using the cross-pollination approach as part of their practice and services offered to a variety of organisations, from the public, community and private sector. They have for example delivered two cross-pollination workshops with Housing Associations (29th Sept 2015 and 12 January 2016) as well as other events. C) The GLA (Great London Authority) invited the PI to support the development and delivery of a cross-pollination event for community-led housing. The event hosted 100 professionals and stakeholders that are key players in community led housing.","http://scalingup-codesign.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/8/5/12856329/scaling-up_booklet_spreads.pdf","58c98e51d12a98.80508547","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c98e51d12a98.80508547&grantRef=AH%2FK006711%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/K006711/1","B82CB02C-A5C1-477E-BF71-FF48F362C0AF","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","89E6D9CB-DAF8-40A2-A9EF-B330A5A7FC24","60DA6BD3-C1C0-4CEF-BA7C-43E8635ED403"

2. How can you remedy it? Find solutions, from quick wins to more advanced tactics
for resource efficiency.
3. What's the size of the prize? Understand potential benefits and set targets.
4. Where are you now? Assess your current performance and benchmark yourself.
5. Where to from here? Identify improvements in a systematic way, take action and
make it a routine activity.
The toolkit is intended for manufacturers on the first steps of an industrial sustainability journey by seeing waste more clearly. It can be used internally or across supply chains. The toolkit contains a range of tools and methods to guide a manufacturer through this journey and integrate eco-efficiency in day-to-day activities in a practical manner. It will help you understand what eco-efficiency means for a company, give examples of best practices, and help manufacturers to implement them in their own factories.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","","A part of the toolkit includes a resource efficiency card game which is used to find waste in factories.

Establish local priorities and existing livelihood coping strategies of rural households to manage water for agriculture; 
Identify perceived effectiveness of groundwater supply and use in the communities, particularly for agricultural irrigation. 
Examine the existing governance arrangements for groundwater distribution and access.The development of the new vulnerability indicators over the last 18 months in BRAVE have created an opportunity to develop an operational partnership with the BRACED Zaman Lebidi project in Burkina Faso. On one hand, BRACED intervenes to Building the Resilience and Adaption of communities to Climate Extremes and Disasters; on the other hand BRAVE intervenes to Bridging science-practice-policy to build livelihoods resilient to drought. These two approaches present many common points of interest which have instigated a joint action supported both by the scientific and technical expertise of the BRAVE project, as well as by the operational aspect and research interest in building resilient communities through the BRACED program. The purpose is to provide the knowledge and capacities needed by rural communities to efficiently manage groundwater resources as part of building their resilience. More specifically, it will examine the vulnerability of communities in relation to the seasonal nature of the use and availability of groundwater resources in order to provide advice in the management of this resource, making use of the newly developed vulnerability indices and the RAINWATCH platform in Burkina Faso.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","Yes","2017","Increasingly erratic rainfall is perceived as main driver of agricultural water insecurity and associated with groundwater availability in the communities. 
Perceptions of shorter rainy seasons with seasonal drying of wells influencing local perceptions about the contribution of groundwater to irrigate crops 
(e.g. the intensification of gardening activities in good rainfall year - 37% hhs in Burkina increasing their frequency of watering in good rainfall year against 16% in Ghana).
Initiatives to explore dry season farming very limited in some locations due to perceived drought risks.What variables shape effective water use for agriculture?
In Burkina, more households own livestock and groundwater key to year round water access (94% own livestock in Tomo and 97% for the other communities. 
In Ghana, the use of water for irrigation correlated to household demography and wealth (e.g. in Jawani and Samini fewer own their house compared to Tariganga and Akara; larger households with more children in Jawani and Samini). This could be expected since maintaining shallow wells and irrigation requires labour inputs and is privately managed.

Engaged research facilitates relationship-building among project researchers and stakeholders, who are the beneficiaries. The stakeholders include local residents and communities, non-governmental organisations, civil society, private enterprise, and formal water management institutions at all levels of government. 

The ASA steps ensure stakeholder benefit: 
Step 1. As each Case Study is BOUND, the researchers' team and stakeholders decide on the problem scope. This means stakeholders have clear, realistic expectations of project benefits, and reduces the risk of extractive research. 

Step 2. In the ADAPTIVE PLANNING PROCESS, stakeholders recognise they have a shared future, and collectively build a vision of resolving the selected water problem, and a pathway to reach that desired future. Thus, benefits of addressing the problem in a clear agreed manner, using research expertise, are formally agreed. Indicators of progress are agreed, embedding accountability. 

Step 3 involves concurrent processes: 
3.1 The RESEARCH activities that will provide findings to address the problem. 
3.2 PARTICPATORY GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENT is the focused process of linking local people facing the problem, with the people mandated to manage the problem. 
3.3 STRATEGIC ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT is an essential tool for stakeholders, because the context of complex problems changes through time, and there are multiple causal loops. This tool provides a mechanism for responsively moving towards the agreed desired future. 

Step 4. In PARTICIPATORY MONITORING AND EVALUATION FOR REFLEXIVE LEARNING, both researchers and stakeholders monitor the indicators selected in Step 2. At each project engagement, participants reflect on and learn from progress in terms of these indicators. When local people &quot;own&quot; the process of positive change the chances are local people will continue to collaborate accountably after the project.

The ASA methodology has been adapted during the current Research Excellence grant due to issues related to COVID-19. This is one of the strengths of this methodology.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","No","2019","The ASA methodology is in the process of review and should be published in a peer-reviewed journal in the upcoming year.

All the project activities and outputs listed in the different tabs of ResearchFish and the MEL report are all related to the application of the ASA methodology. The Theory of Change in the MEL report of March 2022 provides an overview of the impacts. The following five project outputs are the focus of implementation of the Theory of Change through research, workshops and value creation activities:
1. Bound reports for each CS identifying the local land and water management issue to address and the key stakeholders involved
2. Adaptive Planning Process (APP) reflection / outcomes report for each CS
3. Policy briefs and academic publications
4. Participatory governance capacity development and SAM objectives hierarchy for each CS
5. A Value Creation report on co-learning outcomes.

This software is a human-hazard coupled model which is able to assess the impact of rainfall-related hazard events on socioeconomics. The model is within an agent-based framework with a specific reference to the dynamics of the hazards and human environment. The model regards the city as a combination of a series of spatialized blocks connected by various networks (such as road and electricity). After modelling the blocks and networks, a large number of agents is then generated representing different agent types (citizen and government) and population variability. The behaviours, with special consideration to hazard adaption and the decision of these agents are predefined. After which, the daily activity and location of citizen agents are simulated, which are based on the agent needs of water, environmental impacts (wastewater) and hazard interactions. The hazard processes are then generated using widely-recognized open-source hazard models. The consequences of hazards are simulated through GIS spatial analysis packages, together with network analysis (Network X), and graph theory. To test the performance of the model, several rainfall-triggered natural hazards (including urban flood, landslide and fluvial flood) under extreme hydrometeorological events have been modelled and their dynamic exposure has been investigated in a typical city of China.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","Various scenarios have been simulated by the model on disaster risk management.

These revealed very interesting contrasts in the understanding of informality between the two student cohorts. Nonetheless, as with the earlier attempts, there were significant problems coordinating activity between the two groups of students and fitting this exercise into established teaching structures. While the app successfully demonstrated the potential for this kind of approach to be adopted, curricula would need to be developed around this potential rather than attempting to bolt it into established modules.","http://www.saperproject.com/collaborate.html","5a901616e93f35.87031661","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5a901616e93f35.87031661&grantRef=ES%2FP00198X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/P00198X/1","C7934BC1-7F16-42BC-94F5-5FDB4CE3ABE7","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","78AEF67E-4745-40BA-ABA9-C2E56E59F0B0"

"NERC","NE/S008950/1","Research Grant","Research Tools and Methods","University of Strathclyde","Law","Morgera","Elisa","","A new counter-hegemonic mapping tool and instrument","In South Africa a growing network of small-scale fisher leaders, environmental justice organisations and researchers from the One Ocean Hub, currently called the Coastal Justice Network (CJN), has been responding collaboratively over the past two years to a range of injustices - social, environmental, economic - experienced by coastal communities and environments. We have worked collaboratively to respond to the expected negative impacts of proposed offshore oil and gas expansion, lack of participation and other human rights issues around the creation and planning of marine protected areas, policy and management failures towards small-scale fisheries, water crises in coastal communities, COVID lockdown-related limitations to public participation, and others. 

One significant area of work, with noteworthy recent impact is the development of a new counter-hegemonic mapping tool and instrument aimed at linking up, mobilising capacity, and facilitating popular education processes for small-scale fisher leaders, traditional leaders, coastal youth and other coastal citizens who have been negatively affected by the expansion of the network of Marine Protected Areas (MPA). The historical and contemporary human rights issues are MPA expansion include, but are not limited to, communities being forcibly displaced from coastal ancestral land, experiencing heavy restrictions to their access and livelihood practices along the coastline in disregard of their sustainable customary practices, exclusion from MPA planning, zonation and other decision making, and culturally inappropriate and ineffective participatory processes on these issues. The development of the new counter hegemonic mapping tool and instrument is expanding through the CJN collaborative One Ocean Hub - Deep Connections project at Mbazwana in Kwa Zulu Natal.

The counter-hegemonic mapping tool is developed by CJN closely with small-scale fishers communities to: 1. Map their concerns; 2. Support efforts for small-scale fishers and other leaders to participate in online consultations around the country; 3. Document their capacity mobilization needs, and; 4. Continue ethnographic research (oral histories, interviews, focus groups, archival analysis) with small-scale fishers and other coastal groups. 

The CJN used novel creative methods in participatory research (Empatheatre, Public Storytelling, Counter-hegemonic mapping, transgressive learning, popular education) to translate the MPA draft management plan into isiXhosa (the local language), deciphering the complex language and research page by page with the leaders. CJN also used an 'embodied mapping' constellation process in which leaders paced out the draft maps and zonation of the MPA across the hall, using their bodies as reference points for land-marks and noticeable boundaries of the MPA.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2021","The counter-hegemonic mapping tool and instrument developed by the CJN contributed significantly to the inclusion of small-scale fishers in the Amathole MPA consultation in 2021. Counter hegemonic mapping tool and instrument offered more nuanced and detailed understanding of the implications of the draft management plan, enabled the small-scale leaders to document their questions and concerns, and align their concerns to the specific page number of the management plan in preparation for the meeting to discuss the Amathole MPA with South Africa Department of Forestry Fisheries and Environment (DFFE) on 10 June 2021. 

On the day of the meeting, the three nominated small-scale fishers cooperative leaders expressed their concerns and questioned aspects of the management plan. Although the atmosphere/agenda/tone of day was still very much in the control of government leaders, the meeting was held mainly in isiXhosa and our team were able to facilitate an interactive participatory mapping and public storytelling process.

Objective: the first aim is to estimate the optimum balance of storage and transmission in a high renewables European energy system across 30 countries, with a focus on the electricity vector. ESTIMO is be applied to 30 European countries. To reduce model size and run time, these 30 countries can be flexibly aggregated to a smaller number of contingent blocs. Star transmission networks are explored. 

Status:
In September 2021, historic data has been mostly collected and preliminary simulations have been done of the UK to analyse storage needs. Wind and solar generation simulation models have been developed and calibrated. Simulation and scenario modules are developed. ESTIMO has been applied to develop nine zero emission system designs for the UK and Europe with different heat pump, district heating and hydrogen shares, and different configurations of renewables, storage and interconnector capacities. ESTIMO has been run with 35 years of historic meterology data to test long term resilience, and the impact of climate change on heating and cooling demands has been simulated. 

DATA 
Historical data is collated from a number of public and commercial data sources. The data is processed using Python and data packages, notable Pandas, across a number of data formats (excel, csv, etc.). 

MODEL:
The ESTIMO model comprise three principal components: 

A scenario model to project European energy developments over years. 
Hourly simulation model comprising demand, supply, storage and transmission calculations. 
Optimisation which will seek the least cost configuration of the system. 
Scenario model 

Demand/supply scenario model for years 2015 to 2050. This is based on algorithms in the SEEScen (Society Energy Environment Scenario) model by Barrett (2007). It accounts for assumptions about: 
the drivers (population, economic growth, etc.) 
demand efficiency (insulation, appliances etc.) 
end use energy mix (boilers, heat pumps, CHP) 
secondary energy systems (district heating, hydrogen/ammonia) and storage. 
primary energy supply (fossil, nuclear, renewable) 
transmission 
The country outputs of this model can be aggregated to reduce model size. For example the 30 countries might aggregated to 4 blocs - north, south, east and west. The balance between model accuracy and speed can thus be explored. 
The outputs of this model, such as building heat loss, will be inputs to the hourly simulation model. 

 
Hourly simulation: 
The hourly simulation of energy demand and primary energy flow will be based on the algorithms in the DynEMo model first developed by Prof Barrett for research (2010), and for commercial models used by National Grid and Western Power Distribution. 

Demand: hourly demand model for each country driven by social &amp; meteorological data. 
The DynEMo demand algorithms are implemented in Python by Dr Tiziano Gallo Cassarino. 
Supply: hourly supply model for each country driven by demand &amp; meteorological data 
A detailed wind and solar generation model using hourly meteorology data has been 
developed by Dr Ed Sharp. The starting point is modelling generation from the current wind farms across Europe. 
Hourly flows through storage and transmission will be calculated. 
A star configured transmission network is assumed in which each network node (country) is connected to a single central node. 
A complex operational algorithm controls energy flows through the system. 
 

Implementation: 
All data and model programmes are written in Python and use Python packages and libraries: all of this software is free. The software runs on Windows or Unix based desktop machines. Model run speed will be improved where necessary with techniques such as compiling the code with Numba. If speed becomes a problem, UCL's Legion High Performance Cluster might be used. 
Packages used for data handling include Pandas. 
Simulation utilises Python libraries including NumPy and SciPy. 
Optimisation of system design first focuses on storage and transmission decision variables. Algorithms from Python optimisation libraries such as SciPy (genetic, steepest descent, etc.), and our own implementation of biology-inspired ones, have been tested. 
Integrated presentation of results in interactive charts and maps is being developed using routines from various Python visualisation libraries (e.g. Matplotlib, Bokeh, Seaborn) and Plotly.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2021","Model authors Prof Mark Barrett and Dr Tiziano Gallo Cassarino

Impact 
ESTIMO represents significant advances on the integrated modelling of demands and supplies over a large geographical region - the UK plus four European regions. A particularly complex part of the ESTIMO is the operational algorithm which controls the hourly flows through energy converters, stores (electricity, heat, ammonia, hydrogen) and inter-regional interconnectors so as to make good use of the available renewable resources in each hour. 

ESTIMO has been presented in several online sessions, to BEIS, Supergen and to CREDS.

Current regulation by the EU water framework directive (European Union, 2000/60/EC) relates to organic pollution by monitoring selected micropollutants, however, aquatic ecosystem responses requires a comprehensive understanding of dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition. The introduction of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is set to greatly increase our understanding of thecomposition of DOM of both natural and anthropogenic origin derived from diffuse and point sources.
METHODS: DOM was extracted from riverine and treated sewage effluent using solid phase extraction (SPE) and analysed using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis, direct infusion-high resolution Orbitrap™ mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/HRMS). The data obtained were analysed using univariate and multivariate statistics to demonstrate differences in background DOM, anthropogenic inputs and in-river mixing. Compound identifications were achieved based on MS2 spectra searched against on-line databases.
RESULTS: DI-HRMS spectra showed the highly complex nature of all DOM SPE extracts. Classification and visualisation of extracts containing many thousands of individual compounds were achieved using PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis. Kruskal-Wallis analyses highlighted significant discriminating ions originating from the sewage treatment works for more in-depth investigation by HPLC/HRMS. The generation of MS2 spectra in HPLC/HRMS provided the basis for identification of anthropogenic compounds including; pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, metabolites and polymers, although many thousands of compounds remain unidentified.
CONCLUSIONS: This new approach enables comprehensive analysis of DOM in extracts without any preconceived ideas of the compounds which may be present. This approach has the potential to be used as a high throughput, qualitative, screening method to determine if the composition of point sources differs from that of the receiving water bodies, providing a new approach to the identification of hitherto unrecognised organic contribution to water bodies.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2020","Method being applied in a newly submitted funding application in relation to Highlight Topic Call from NERC.",,"5e67a4f62181e1.42547789","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e67a4f62181e1.42547789&grantRef=NE%2FK010905%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K010905/1","98EDC7F4-6237-4CE4-AC41-8885A109DAE5","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","081B3E5A-9959-4EB3-8CB9-FD57379EEE0F"

The optimization model of power dispatch is established, in which the total cost of coal, the total amount of emission, and the reduction of pollutants' concentration in key areas are taken as the objectives of expectation. Within the model, the calculation of the amount of the reduction on pollutants' concentration is based on Gaussian puff dispersion model, the weather forecast data and the predicted pollution levels in densely populated areas. The model is solved by steps and by sets. First, the basic generation schedule without environmental capacity margin constraints is solved. Second, under the basic schedule, the power units that contribute more to the environmental capacity in key areas under specific weather conditions are classified into subset1 and their power is to be reduced to meet the environmental requirements; other units which are less harmful to environment are classified into subset2 and their power is to be increased by an equal amount to meet power balance requirements. Third, by revising the schedule of the two subsets using Lagrange multiplier method, the differentiated daily generation schedule is formed. 
However, the spinning reserve of the system and the accommodation abilities of wind power can be changed because of the revision of the basic generation schedule. Therefore, a more complete generation schedule with second revision is proposed. After the first revision, if the spinning reserve of system is insufficient, the schedule will be revised for the second time to meet spinning reserve capacity requirements. Similarly, if the accommodation abilities of wind power are changed, the generation schedule of wind farm will also be adjusted.
Based on the first revision schedule, considering different possibilities of spinning reserve capacity and wind power consumption, 8 different situations are discussed for the second revision schedule. For each situation, after obtaining the total amount of adjustment of wind power and thermal power, the total amount is allocated to each unit with respect to different environmental capacity margins and different unit coal consumption levels. Finally, the schedule of second revision is solved by Lagrange multiplier method. 
Two practical examples are applied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation results prove that the differentiated power dispatch solution is valid on solving daily power generation schedule with consideration of environmental capacity margins of key area, wind power accommodation abilities and spinning reserve capacities. 
In the process of solving the daily power generation schedule, the forecasted net load data should be obtained based on the simulation of the power system containing renewable power resources and electric vehicle cluster charging loads.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","It provide useful information for charging infrastructure design.",,"56d86a21593498.79804201","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56d86a21593498.79804201&grantRef=EP%2FL001063%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/L001063/1","34FFD228-2F72-461E-AD54-A92D2D826225","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","EC23DA53-CA73-4104-A3F6-2A9523484E69","805BF1A0-B634-4558-BA5E-9CB38293A4AC"

Performing the role of knowledge broker is inherent to our work, where we co-produce information with scientists, practitioners and community members that is applicable and useful for municipal decision making. In addition, pivotal to the work we do is trying to understand the decision contexts in Southern Africa cities so that we understand how best to integrate new knowledge into these contexts to illicit long-term sustainable change. Through our on-going work, a number of key considerations have been learnt that better allow co-produced information to be mainstreamed into city decision making pathways.

Identifying land that is most vulnerable in terms of contributing microbial pollution to water allows spatially-targeted catchment management for improving water quality and safeguarding human health. Catchment managers and environmental regulators need robust tools to help prioritise investment of their resources for protecting socially and economically important downstream areas, such as bathing or shellfish harvesting waters. We have worked with stakeholders to co-design a decision support tool (DST) that can identify critical sources of E. coli pollution. The DST will be used by UK regulators (e.g. Environment Agency, SEPA) and farm advisors (Natural England and the Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) teams) to assess the risk of microbial pollution within catchments.

Furthermore the control signals from WAMS controllers are typically dispatched to devices based on system controllability indices, i.e., to generators or devices from which the best controllability of observed oscillations could be achieved. The WAMS based controllers designed in this stream are only be robustly designed to incorporate time delays in signal transmission, loss of signals (input and output) and to provide supplementary control signals in addition to existing controllers in the network, as was done in the past, but also consider signal dispatch to key available power sources (generation &amp; storage) at given time, HVDC lines and FACTS devices. The reliance on contribution from key available power sources minimises control effort while inclusion of plethora of devices that will potentially receive supplementary control signals will expand the use of WAMS controllers to all devices and technologies that will be available in future power networks.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","The reliance on contribution from key available power sources minimises control effort while inclusion of plethora of devices that will potentially receive supplementary control signals will expand the use of WAMS controllers to all devices and technologies that will be available in future power networks.",,"58c94d06ad1279.18875719","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c94d06ad1279.18875719&grantRef=EP%2FL014351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/L014351/1","E18E8B45-801B-40D5-AF7B-6C459F5F2DD1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","06B69545-AB85-4DB9-A2A7-06EBFF58AF78"

It builds on research carried out by RECODE-NETWORK identifying and evaluating the opportunities a re-distributed production model offers to disrupt traditional industry models when combined with big data. 

The current &quot;take-make-sell-use-dispose&quot; system, as a linear economy, is not sustainable anymore, and needs to be rethought. Design is not considered in that system as predominant element, but it should, given that Industrial Designers define to a large degree, the materials needed and the way an object will be produced, displayed, advertised, sold, used and disposed. Currently 80% of materials end up in landfills, and the only way designers can do something about is knowing the impact and possible solutions. The concept is simple; humans need to change the linear process into a circular one.
 
This project aims to create a guide for Industrial designers, to implement Circular Economy in their process through the development of a tool, based on literature review and secondary data from experts in the field.

These methods will now allow the production engine adaptive requirement issues to be addressed. 

The first method uses a recurrent neural network, trained using a fully recurrent methodology. The allows in-cylinder pressures in IC engines to be reconstructed using measured crank kinematics as input to a suitably configured recurrent (NARX) neural network. This is tested on real engine data to assess reconstruction capability. It avoids the need for extremely expensive pressure sensors used in closed-loop engine combustion control. The challenge addressed is to accurately predict cylinder pressure traces within the cycle under generalisation conditions: i.e. using data not previously seen by the network during training. The NARX neural network is first trained using a tuned fully-recurrent training methodology - the so called 'Robust Adaptive Gradient Descent' (RAGD) algorithm). This involves direct construction and calibration of a suitable inverse crank dynamic model which owing to singular behaviour at top-dead-centre (TDC), has proved very difficult in the past via physical model construction, calibration, and inversion. Training using the RAGD algorithm offers a practical option for assembly line training of NARX networks for engine cylinder pressure reconstruction owing to its high efficiency and reasonable accuracy, not previously possible using alternative recurrent training methods. This method is generally fast but much complicated than the second method.

The second method uses much simpler Time-Delay feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks trained with the standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The same approach can be applied to reconstruction via either measured crank kinematics obtained from a shaft encoder, or measured engine cylinder block vibrations obtained from a production knock sensor. The basis of the procedure is initially justified by examination of the information content within measured data, which is considered to be equally important as the network architecture and training methodology. Key hypotheses are constructed and tested using data taken from a 3-cylinder (DISI) engine to reveal the influence of the data information content on reconstruction potential. The findings of these hypotheses tests are then used to develop the methodology. The approach is tested by reconstructing cylinder pressure across a wide range of steady-state engine operation using both measured crank kinematics and block accelerations. The results obtained show a very marked improvement over previously published reconstruction accuracy for both crank kinematics and cylinder block vibration based reconstruction using measurements obtained from a multi-cylinder engine. The paper shows that by careful processing of measured engine data, a standard neural network architecture and a standard training algorithm can be used to very accurately reconstruct engine cylinder pressure with high levels of robustness and efficiency.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","The research projects investigating pressure trace reconstruction by adaptive neural networks has potential as a technology for closed-loop combustion control (CLCC). This type of technology will enable advanced internal combustion (IC) engine combustion systems and the implementation of new technologies. These will improve the efficiency of the IC engine so reducing CO2 emission from the transport sector. Advanced control strategies allowing new combustion and engine technologies to be realised will also contribute to further reductions in exhaust emissions, both gaseous and particulate, that are required to improve air quality. CLCC may also enable engines to adapt to variations in fuels and fuel qualities in world markets and allow the introduction of sustainable alternative fuels without the need to calibrate the engine to all possible fuel blends.

As a result DOM has a multifaceted role in the biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems, impacting upon ecosystem production, complexation of trace metals and the mobilisation of
pollutants. Understanding its role within the transfer of Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorus to waters and its cycling within freshwater ecosystems has been limited, to date, by the lack of an effective sample handling and analytical protocol which allows identification of each of the major chemical forms contributing to this flux, and in particular the dissolved organic matter fraction (as DOC, DON and DOP). This paper presents the outcomes of a novel approach allowing this level of identification, across two contrasting catchments. The novel method uses sequential analysis, filtration and digestion using persulphate oxidation under high temperature and pressure, to separate these fractions and, in combination with the use of novel fluorescence and UV-visible spectrometric approaches, allows the quantification of DOM flux in these systems and a parallel assessment of DOM quality.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2016","Initially within the programme, but others are now adopting this technique, notably in the NERC LOCATE programme headed by CEH, and in the revision of standard monitoring practice in Wessex Water's routine water quality monitoring programme.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716314000","5aa8f8ab434ce3.46240950","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5aa8f8ab434ce3.46240950&grantRef=NE%2FK010689%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K010689/1","C2E859B5-8451-42A3-8ACE-B587117C3473","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","F3755C41-62CB-439D-959A-2B52F747D106"

We useddaily measurements (µg/m3) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) particulate matter with diameter less than 10µm (PM10), particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5µm (PM2.5) and ozone (O3)for 2009 through 2013 from the fixed air pollution monitoring sites run by theLondon Air Quality Network, in the Greater London Area. We calculated the 24h average concentrations of NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and the maximum 8-hour average O3 concentration to represent daily exposure. We used all available monitoring sites in the study area (NO2/NOx: 130 sites; PM10/PM2.5: 115 sites/33 sites &amp; predicted values for 71 site locations; O3:62 sites). 

Land use data
We obtained road geography and information on road traffic flows from the Department of Transport (https://www.dft.gov.uk/traffic-counts/). Land use variables were derived from Land Cover Map Great Britain 2007. In addition, we used building and population density data for 2011 (census data). GIS analyses were conducted to extract 95 potential predictor variables in total.These variables are traffic-related, characterize land use and population density in different buffers around the fixed air pollution monitoring sites. The geographical coordinates of each monitoring site were geocoded. The buffer zones used for traffic-related variables were: 50, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 m and were selected to take account of known dispersion patterns. Total traffic load on a major road was calculated as length of the road segment multiplied by traffic intensity and divided by road segment for all roads within each buffer zone. We also calculated the length of the major road segments in different buffer zones around the fixed monitoring sites, traffic intensity on the nearest major road to the fixed monitoring site and inverse distance to the nearest major road to the fixed monitoring site. The buffer zones used for land use were 100, 300, 500, 1000 and 5000 m to characterize land use (transportation, industry, woodland, grassland, freshwater, urban and suburban areas). Areas of different land cover usewere calculated in m2, within each buffer zone. 

Temporal variables
We used meteorological data from 53 fixed meteorological site located at the study area for the years 2009 - 2013. We extracted over all available sites, mean daily temperature (oC), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), barometric pressure (mb), radiation (Wh/m2/day), cloud coverage (oktas) and wind direction (oN). Moreover, we considered indicator variables for different years (reference category was 2009), day of the week (reference category: Sunday), a variable for day count, accounting for trends within each year (1 to 366).

Spatio-temporal LUR model development 
We developed spatio-temporal semiparametric models. All continuous covariates were entered in the model alternatively as a linear and as a smoothed term, except geographical location for which a bivariate smooth function was used. For each of the potential predictors, we included in the final model the term (linear or smoothed) that provided the better model fit in terms of Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML). The final set of explanatory variables was selected based on the adjusted-R2 obtained from several alternative models where all the temporal and spatial covariates were tested as above.All covariates were allowed to enter the model only if they were statistically significant (p-value less than 5%) and if their regression coefficients conformed to the pre-specified direction of effect.

The final spatio-temporal LUR model for NO2 accounted for temperature (penalized splines with 3 degrees of freedom - df), wind direction (penalized splines with 3 degrees of freedom - df)and wind speed, relative humidity, for the day of the year (penalized splines with 6 degrees of freedom - df)and for different years. a smooth bivariate function (thin plate spline) of the geographical location of the fixed monitoring sites for NO2to account for the residual spatial correlation.Significant spatial predictors weretotal traffic load in a buffer of 50 meters around each monitoring site, inverse distance of the monitoring sites to the nearest major road (included as a non-linear term), urban area land use in a buffer of 300 meters around each monitoring siteand geographical location of the monitoring sites. Appropriate degrees of freedom were estimated via REML. 

The developed model for NOx included the same set of temporal and spatial covariates as the model for NO2, plus thetotal length of major roads in a buffer of 100 meters around each monitoring site. 

The final model for PM10 accounted for temperature, wind direction and speed, barometric pressure, for the day of the year and for different years. Temperature, wind direction, barometric pressure and daycount were included as non-linear terms (using penalized splines with 3 / 6 degrees of freedom). Significant spatial predictors weretotal traffic load in a buffer of 100 meters around each monitoring site, inverse distance of the monitoring sites to the nearest major road (included as a non-linear term) and a smooth bivariate function (thin plate spline) of the geographical location of the fixed monitoring sites. 

The final model for PM2.5 included the same set of temporal covariates as the model for PM10and in addition relative humidity (as a linear term). While, regarding variables on the spatial scale, included was the total length of major roads in a buffer of 300m around each monitoring site, the inverse distance of monitoring sites to the nearest major road (as a non-linear term) and the geographical location of monitoring sites. 

The final model for O3 accounted for temperature, wind direction and speed, relative humidity, cloud coverage, for the day of the year and for different years. Temperature, wind direction and daycount were included as non-linear terms (using penalized splines with 3 / 6degrees of freedom). Significant spatial covariates weretotal traffic load in a buffer of 100 meters around each monitoring site, inverse distance of the monitoring sites to the nearest major road (a non-linear term)and geographical location of the monitoring sites. 

Our final models did not include any terms for space-time interactions, since it did not add to the value of the adjusted-R2. 

Chemical Transport Modeling (CTM) Data
After developing the spatio-temporal LUR models as described above, we incorporated a daily predicted value for NO2, NOx, PM10, PM2.5 and O3 estimated from the CMAQ-urban model at fixed site air pollution monitoring locations. We refer to these models as the combined LUR-dispersion models.

Aerosol optical depth (AOD) data
Furthermore, a spatio-temporal model for estimating daily PM2.5 concentrations over the study area was developed using aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. 

Model combination 
Following, a generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to combine predicted concentrations of NO2, NOx, PM10, PM2.5 and O3 at fixed site monitoring locations from 1) developed spatio-temporal LUR models and 2) CMAQ-urban model. Moreover, a GAM was applied to combine predicted PM2.5concentrations from 1) developed spatio-temporal LUR models, 2) CMAQ-urban model and 3) AOD model. The model is of the following form:
We refer to these models as the combined GAM models.

Model validation
We investigated the validity of the spatio-temporal LUR modelsand the combined models (LUR-dispersion and GAM) using 10-fold cross validation (CV). We randomly selected 90% of the sites (training set), fit the model (on the train data) and then used the remaining 10% (validation set) of the sites for model evaluation (get the predictions for the validation set, from the model just fit on the train data). This was repeated ten times, such that each site was in a test set once.

The statistical analysis was conducted using the R statistical software (version 2.10.1; R Development Core Team 2009) and the R library &quot;SemiPar&quot; version 1.0-2.

Model fit
The adjusted R2 values and the CV adjusted R2 values of the final spatio-temporal LUR models ranged from 0.61 to 0.72 and from 0.57 to 0.74 respectively, the combined LUR-dispersion models R2 and CV adjusted R2 ranged from 0.79 to 0.84 and 0.75 to 0.81 respectively and the combined GAM models R2 and CV adjusted R2 from 0.72 to 0.83 and 0.71 to 0.82 respectively","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2019","This models can be used by other researchers for better exposure to air pollutants estimation in London within the context of health studies, such as cohort studies.

A specialised pilot bioreactor able to mix the material needed to be used. Adding the paper in batches also allowed digestion to occur, preventing the material from becoming too thick. Enzymes were then used to break down the complex carbohydrates (saccharification) to simple sugars that yeast ferments into ethanol. After an initial enzyme treatment, further saccharification feeds sugars into yeast fermentation simultaneously. This, along with the mixing and the batch addition of paper waste keeps the bioreactor working steadily and a final ethanol yield of 11.6% - as high as that in current commercial biofuel production and higher than any other reported yields from paper or paper pulp waste streams..

The researchers believe that there is considerable room to improve on this figure even more, by optimising batch addition regimes and the initial enzyme concentrations (which are low to reduce input costs). Different yeast strains may convert sugars to ethanol more efficiently, for example heat-tolerant yeasts may be better suited the exact conditions in this set-up.

The toolkit can be used by organisations to diagnose current performance, identify potential areas of action which can deliver substantial performance improvements, and develop a collaborative plan for long-term competency development.
 
The dimensions of performance proposed are:
1) Efficiency - how well are current operations operated? (Focus on energy, water, materials input and waste and water output)
2) Internalisation - what is the approach to business model innovation? (seek value from its waste)
3) Coordination and collaboration - how effective is the business at identifying and working with unusually valuable partners?
4) Whole system design - how effective is the firm in conceptualising and implementing radically improved new system designs?
Competency assessment helps companies understand what they need to be good at in order to support the transition to a sustainable industrial system. Existing competency in efficiency, internalisation, collaboration &amp; coordination, and whole system design are explored and compared with the performance of other organisations. Areas for improvement can then be identified and prioritised.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2014","The is tool has been used in workshops in the UK and internationally with industry and academia including a workshops with a global apparel company .

(2021) A New Collection Tool-Kit to Sample Microplastics From the Marine Environment (Sediment, Seawater, and Biota) Using Citizen Science. Frontiers in Marine Science https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.657709). Under the One Ocean Hub these methodologies are being refined to be used in Ghana. Details about these methodologies are explained below. 

We developed a simple, cost-effective and practical tool-kit to collect microplastics from the coastal environment and engaged the public in scientific research. The tool-kit was designed to take into account the latest recommendations for sampling each environmental substrate, whilst being practical for citizen scientists to use. This research demonstrates that using a semi-structured to structured project with a defined sampling approach including the participation of the public with local knowledge can be an effective way to monitor microplastics in the marine environment along the Scottish coastline. This approach, can be adapted to other projects monitoring microplastics to increase the use of citizen science in projects, allowing more studies to take place, more samples to be collected, and a greater understanding of the occurrence and the potential impact of microplastics in the environment.

Sampling kits were designed to be simple tool-kits, easily used by all volunteers. The tool-kit consisted of a pole-water sampler, glass jars (15 of 7 ml), plastic bottles (5 of 500 ml), sealable plastic bags, filter paper already placed in Petri dishes, aluminum foil, deionised water (1l), electrical tape, water-resistant pencil, ice blocks (3) and a cool box (Figure 2). The water-sampler, bottles, bags and jars were rinsed and cleaned with deionised water and 70% ethanol prior to being sealed. The filter papers and Petri dishes were examined using a stereomicroscope 37.5&times; magnification prior to sealing with electrical tape to ensure no contamination. Bottles, bags and jars were partially labeled to facilitate the work in the field by the volunteers. All materials were stored in an insulated cool-box immediately after collection and during transport of samples to the laboratory, which allowed safe transportation of materials. The cool-box provided thermal insulation for the samples, resulting in slower development of organic matter, as well as a convenient way to transfer materials to and from the site. The volunteers were asked to take a knife (Swiss army type knife) prior to going into the field, to be able to remove the mussels from their substrate.

At all research locations, intertidal sediment (i.e., sand), coastal water and benthic organisms (i.e., M. edulis) were collected four times during the year (every 13 weeks) to investigate seasonal variability in microplastic abundances, polymer types and shapes. All the sites were sampled at the same time (e.g., over the same weekend) to avoid large weather and tidal disparities between locations.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2021","We are using a methodology for collecting microplastics that is relatively inexpensive and hence can be used by a developing country to undertake microplastic collection.","https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.657709/full","620be4e4e31be4.62920891","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=620be4e4e31be4.62920891&grantRef=NE%2FS008950%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/S008950/1","80E9F662-4CE4-4727-8362-9DBFFC23294D","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","5BB4F8BF-B4E0-4EAF-9AF5-885E19D64850","8100DA17-E142-4073-9536-FAE41FB791FB"

An Analytical Framework

The framework is designed to both informing of, and is shaped by; colleagues collaborative work in the INCUT network. INCUT brings together scholars interested in theoretical and empirical studies of urban low carbon transitions in a wide range of different urban contexts in both the global south and north. This paper provides a conceptual lens through which we can begin to interrogate and compare urban low carbon transition dynamics in multiple contexts according to a clear analytical framework. It is not our intention that colleagues and policy makers should try to utilise the whole framework but parts of it should be helpful in informing the framing and development of their contributions to the project and book.

Third, the framework is also designed to be informing of wider societal and policy debates about the potential and limits of low carbon urbanism. It is our intention in later iterations of the work to develop a more engaged and translational version of the framework with policy partners involved in the INCUT network to both reflect on critical lessons learnt from low carbon policy initiatives and experiments but also to be informing of the strategic direction of future policy responses. 

The rest of the paper is structured into a four-stage framework structured as follows (see figure 1). Section 2 focuses on designing low carbon urbanism and asks what does it mean to be low carbon? Section 3 centres on practicing low carbon urbanism and looks at what and who is involved in the transition. Section 3 concentrates on mobilizing low carbon urbanism and reviews how the transitions unfold. Section 4 provides an initial overview of transition pathways - and reviews multiple junctions towards the low carbon city focusing on how would we recognize a transition when we see it. Section 5, the conclusion, provides a synthesis of urban transitions 1 and 2.

























Figure 1: Urban Transition 2.0 - The four-fold framework


1. Designing low carbon urbanism 
The first step in the framework is concerned with the issue of societal development - and the crucial question what does it mean to be low carbon? Whilst acknowledging the multiplicity and contradiction embedded in current attempts to realize low carbon, we propose a way of analysing low carbon urbanism based on the development of novel ways of thinking about the low carbon and development interface. Decarbonisation is then not confined to setting targets to reduce emissions, but involves a host of more or less explicit ways in which carbon comes to be problematized and acted upon in relation to (in this case) the city, thus positioning low carbon as a (potentially) transformative process. The design of low carbon urbanism includes establishing shared understanding of challenges of low carbon in relation to particular urban contexts for intervention. These forms of understanding then powerfully shape the form of coalitions and selection of intermediary institutions, the identification of technological interventions to be trialled, and agreement on the governance principles to be followed. 





Figure 2: Designing Low Carbon Urbanism


Figure 2 outlines the two main dimensions of urban low carbon design. The first is socio-technical configurations primarily focused on how the existing context shapes the spaces for innovation around low carbon urbanism. Here we sympathetically review the main contribution of innovation studies in urban transitions 1.0 and the gaps that need to be addressed in urban transitions 2.0. The second is ways of thinking about the relations between low carbon and urban development priorities and here we select three frameworks that enable us to reinsert multiple geographies and contextually embedded issues into urban transitions studies from disciplines outside of innovation studies.

Understanding transitions is not so much about extracting lessons from a few ideal cases, but about embedding new rationalities and subjectivities. Abandoning an exclusive focus on GHG reduction and climate mitigation (and end-of-pipe approach), low carbon is repositioned as a development approach with transformative political and economic implications. Here we acknowledge how transitions are framed by political economic contexts, including issues of resource control and ecological security. In acknowledging the political aspects of low carbon transitions, we open up possibilities for the mobilization of low carbon towards a broad variety of social objectives, including carbon control, urban ecological security and issues of social justice and urban inequality. These we must reiterate are not an exhaustive list of issues but begin to provide frameworks through which we may conceptualise the embedding of low carbon urbanism within particular urban contexts.
 Environmental fix security and social justice. 

2. Practicing low carbon urbanism
Practicing low carbon urbanism involves asking what and who is involved in the transition? This means working with and upon three distinct sets of elements (see figure 3). First, the agents and subjectivities that operate as initiators and partners or act as subjects of intervention. Second, the objects and flows of the material world involved in the production of carbon. Finally, a set of mechanisms and techniques that operate as material, framing and discursive devices capable of influencing both agents and objects. 




Figure 3: Practicing Low Carbon Urbanism


2.1 Agents, intermediaries, networks and subjectivities
Governing low carbon in the city transcends the local arena, involving a broad range of agents beyond the local state. On one hand, non-state actors from private and non-profit sectors are increasingly playing a greater role in shaping, configuring and contesting climate responses in the city. On the other, making low carbon in the city is a multi-scalar process, made of interactions between agents located at different scales, from the dwelling and the city to transnational and global arenas. Looking at climate change from the lens of these diverse scales challenges traditional understanding of environmental governance that assume that decisions are cascaded from international to national to local levels. As a result, the agents involved in making low carbon are broad and diverse. Different entities operate as initiators and partners, aiming to influence a set of agents. These can include government organizations at local, regional or national levels, as well as private sector organizations, non-profits or community groups, amongst others. They interact in a variety of modes of action including, forms of intermediation, the development of networks and the production of new subjectivities. 


2.2 Objects and flows
Practising low carbon unfolds through transformations of a series of objects and flows - these are the socio-material elements that are subject to the transition. A revised research framework for a low carbon urban transitions 2.0 needs to acknowledge the materiality of the city and the way in which physical infrastructures, flows, practices and built environments clearly structure how climate change as an urban problem is conceived and addressed. Networked Infrastructures-such as the energy, transport and communications networks-play a vital role in structuring urban transitions. They are both key catalysts for environmental problems and the critical means through which the governing of climate change takes place. Discourse analysis on its own fails to recognize how policy making is implemented in the context of existing material. Analyses of climate change that do not recognise the materiality of the city, very often associated to the policy implementation stages, fail to provide an accurate account of the scale and practical impact of the transition. 


2.3 Mechanism and techniques
By mechanisms and techniques we refer to a broad range of technologies, institutions, and instruments used in the making of low carbon. These are devices, tools, techniques, personnel, materials and apparatuses that enable the possibility to imagine and act upon the conduct of the people to be governed. Common techniques used in governing the environment are, for example: the production of reports and discourses on the global monitoring of resources the use of mapping and other representation techniques for the creation of environmental objects and the development of systems and indicators to define, classify and separate objects of environmental concern. In rolling out specific techniques for advancing a low carbon urbanism, thought takes material from, as charts, texts, graphs, measuring devices, audits, quality controls and other seemingly mundane devices of the everyday are enlisted in the governing effort . Techniques confirm expertise, define an intelligible field of action and roll out specific forms of intervention. 


3. Mobilizing Low Carbon Urbanism
Transitions are always unfolding and in the making. Critical to the shift here is to develop a more nuanced and enlarged understanding of the implications and societal consequences of low carbon urbanism. This needs to move away from the notion of successful or failed technological innovations in Urban Transitions 1.0 to a more processual and socially embedded understanding in Urban Transitions 2.0. Consequently, we examine three different process involved in mobilizing low carbon urbanism - see figure 4 - asking how does the transition unfold. These processes are the result of the constant iteration between designing and practising low carbon, and are seen as steps and moments within the attempt to mainstream a low carbon urbanism. As with other elements within this framework, mobilising low carbon is not about intervening in a single site or space, but require changes, transformations and actions across different scales and sites. The processes discussed in this section are experimentation, learning, and scaling up and each one of these connect to systemic change in different manners, and draws differently from their geographical and political contexts.




Figure 4 Mobilizing low carbon urbanism



4. Urban Transition Pathways: multiple junctions towards the low carbon city

The coming together of the design, practice and mobilization of low carbon suggests possible pathways through which a low carbon urbanism occurs. Such pathways are neither singular nor linear, but multiple and interconnected. They should not be seen exclusively as positive, progressive, or devoid of conflict. Pathways can also be sites of conflict, contestation or an expression of regressive rationalities. They are multiple junctions where different interests come together. The critical question then is how would we recognize an urban transition when we see it? This involves acknowledgment of different narratives within sustainability pathways, resulting from different actors and networks, framing systems dynamics, boundaries and goals operating in different ways. Similarly, seeing pathways as sites where a diversity of imagined urban futures coexist, pathways can be used to understand the emerging - and often contradictory - politics of low carbon systems and its alternative configurations. 
This is a further area in which the team needs to undertake further work on the emerging pathways of low carbon urbanism. The following are some suggested possible themes for work on pathways for low carbon urbanism in Urban Transitions 2.0:

• Multiple transitions pathways: work analysing differently constituted transitions pathways developing an understanding of the interconnection between low carbon and wider logics such as ecological modernisation, ecological services, resilience and security, smart cities, community based approaches etc. 
• Competing transition pathways: unpacking the social interests developing and societal implications of competing transitions paths within urban contexts.
• Developing collective subjectivities: understanding whether different communities of practice change meanings and forms of relating to the city and its infrastructures in order to reduce their emissions.


5. Conclusion 
We develop a framework for Urban Transitions 2.0 based on a sympathetic critique of the first wave of urban transition studies - as outlined in table 1. The most critical feature of this framework is fourfold. First, to shift away from emissions based focus and construct a more developmental understanding of the purposes of low carbon urbanism. Second, to shift the refocus from transition processes and manager to look more carefully at the agent, objectives and techniques of the practices of low carbon urbanism. Third, to move away from a narrow focus on successful or failed transitions to develop a more enlarged understanding of the implications of experimentation, learning and upscaling. Finally, to complete a shift away from the notion of single to multiple and contested transitions. These we argue are the main challenges for Urban Transitions 2.0.

SOI does this by identifying responses to tensions that arise in such engagements. This tool provides a systematic approach for appraising opportunities in searching for sustainability-oriented innovations. It adopts a behavioural and institutional perspective in which unusual partners can engage and collaboratively source information to learn about what types of partnerships and incorporated logics support a better search for sustainable opportunities. The tool, therefore, stimulates thinking about sustainability oriented search processes and the suitability of different hybrid organizational forms used to create a larger variety of sustainability-oriented products and processes. The tool does this by appraising tensions and their resultant variety-generating responses that - owing to different search principles - change the course of search or result in the discovery useful information and knowledge. Academics and practitioners can use this tool to understand how to effectively increase variety in organizations searching for sustainable opportunities.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","","It is anticipated this tool will be tested in industry during 2016 and impacts will be reported then.",,"5638768b229a13.25917888","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5638768b229a13.25917888&grantRef=EP%2FI033351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I033351/1","55AB8CA6-FEC5-48D1-B3D8-13ED830934CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","68F9AC3F-225C-4FAD-A645-C2F5A9BBB85A"

It is based on a classical net present value method, and developed and implemented in the Matlab App Designer platform. 
The tool processes, outputs and evaluates the cash flow of the microgrid under study and exhibits the following features:
1) Specific PV and energy storage capacity configurations can be selected according to the island's electricity consumption (which is an input to the tool)
2) Each system parameter is given a recommended value; users can also modify the parameters according to specific conditions

The new flood forecasting system has been applied to the 2,500-km2 Eden Catchment and tested by 'forecasting' the 2015 flood event cased by Storm Desmond. At 10-m spatial resolution, the flood forecasting system is able to successfully reproduce the water level hydrographs at the downstream river channels, accurately &quot;forecast&quot; the flood extent in the Carlisle city centre, and provide 34 hr of lead time with the NWP products released 36 hr in advance.

The approach used to analyse the policies is based on lexicometric content analysis, which measures the frequency of use of words within the studied texts. From these usage frequencies, mathematical and statistical indices can be derived which allow the interlinkages between texts to be interrogated and emergent perspectives to emerge. The specific methods used and described here have been designed and coded specifically for the particular requirements of the analysis rather than using proprietary lexicometric software. The application of the employed lexicometric analyses are novel for ocean policy and for the Pacific, but lexicometric analyses have been widely used in other studies including law and public policy (Boulet et al., 2019).

The extraction of the information for the analysis from the corpus of 18 policy texts into a structured hierarchical classification involved the following 6 steps (a set of definitions, a list of themes and further technical detail on steps 2, 5, and 6 are all provided in the Supplementary Material here: https://bit.ly/3uMgAtl):
• Step 1: convert documents from .PDF to.txt format and cleaning up the files;
• Step 2: extract noun phrases (or &quot;expressions&quot;) from the corpus of policy texts;
• Step 3: edit and filter the list of all the distinct expressions extracted from the corpus. The list obtained forms the vocabulary of the corpus;
• Step 4: identify the main themes of interest for the characterisation and analysis of the content of policies. Partition of all themes into domains;
• Step 5: each word of each expression is put in its canonical form, its lemma, and each lemma is assigned to one and only one theme. The hierarchy lemmas &lt; themes &lt; domains form the taxonomy;
• Step 6: for each policy, for each theme, counting the number of distinct lemmas assigned to the theme and found in the expressions of the text. The distribution of the number of lemmas by theme constitutes the profile of the policy. Estimation of the similarity between the policies taken by pairs.

Step 1 is commonly performed in natural language processing (NLP) of textual corpora but it is not a fully automated process. It includes the homogenisation of texts (UTF08 encoding), the elimination of layout markers and references to figures, etc. For this reason, text tables have been omitted unless they presented useful information in textual form.

Step 2 uses algorithms for the automatic extraction of noun phrases. However, this extraction is a relatively complex task which requires in particular the parsing of the text into sentences, then their parsing into tokens (most of them being words), followed by a syntactic analysis making it possible to identify the noun phrases through the grammatical function they occupy in each sentence. In order to ensure a good recall of this step, we use three free- or share-wares as detailed in the Supplementary Material. The lists of expressions produced by these three approaches are then merged into a single list, keeping both any nested expressions and the phrases into which they fit (e. g. &quot;environmental impact assessment&quot; is nested in &quot;application of environmental impact assessment&quot;).

This resultant single list is then analysed (Step 3) to remove all expressions that have an indeterminate or too general meaning when they are detached from the sentences in which they were used. Reading them in a list, outside the textual context, does not allow to link them to a theme or policy sector (e. g. &quot;annual growth rate,&quot; &quot;potential earnings&quot;). After this lexical filtering, more than 13,500 distinct expressions endowed with an autonomous meaning (independent of the context), form the vocabulary of the corpus of 18 policies. Each expression or noun phrase is made up of one or more words.

A set of themes is then formed from the vocabulary. The approach chosen in this fourth step (Step 4) is based on the differentiated and complementary expertise of the co-authors to identify these themes rather than on a purely lexical-semantic analysis or a clustering statistic. In this way the identified themes are meaningful in the context of the making of policies and regulations related to the oceans and marine resources, socio-ecological changes and development, in particular in the specific context of the Pacific region. The 34 themes thus obtained were divided into 5 domains, &quot;activities,&quot; &quot;development,&quot; &quot;environmental changes,&quot; &quot;governance,&quot; and &quot;law, policy, and politics&quot;. 

In Step 5 (see Supplementary Material for details), each word entering the composition of an expression of the vocabulary, except stop-words, is lemmatised. More than 3,800 of such lemmas were obtained and each lemma is then assigned to a theme. The hierarchy formed by the list of lemmas assigned to the 34 themes themselves partitioned into five domains. This constitutes the taxonomy of the corpus of policies analysed. By construction, an expression comprising several lemmas can be linked to more than one theme, for example, &quot;advocacy for low carbon development&quot; is related to the themes &quot;law&quot; [label: LAW], &quot;environment and climate change&quot; [ENCC] and &quot;development&quot; [DEVe] via the lemmas &quot;advocacy,&quot; &quot;carbon,&quot; and &quot;development,&quot; respectively. Acronyms and frozen expressions are not lemmatized but directly related to a theme.

The policy texts are taken one by one in Step 6, to search for each expression. For each policy, the number of distinct lemmas assigned to each theme is counted. The presentation of this result in the form of a histogram constitutes the profile of policy.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2021","Hub researchers have contributed to the long-awaited Blue Pacific Ocean Report launched by the Pacific Ocean Commissioner in 2021. The Report provides a stocktake of the progress of ocean policy implementation and proposes forward-looking strategies to improve ocean governance and sustainability. A team drawn from the Hub contributed a section called &quot;Lessons from a Research on the analysis of regional ocean policy inter-linkages&quot;. This analysis used a lexicometric content analysis of regional ocean policies and identified opportunity for policy retirement, embedding of expanding sectors to reduce fragmentation and increased coherence of the Ocean with key regional development themes. This analysis was carried out by Pierre Mazzega (CNRS, University Jean Jaur&egrave;s, France), Claire Lajaunie (INSERM, University Aix-Marseille, France), Jeremy Hills (USP) and Payal Maharaj (USP). The work was carried out in collaboration with the Office of the Pacific Ocean Commissioner who are the Hub's project partners.

Current methods of analysing and enumerating the quality of drinking water currently take a minimum of 18 hours and up to several days in some cases. This is not fast enough to meet the needs of both post-disaster and low-resource communities. The Water Engineering Research Group at the University of Birmingham, led by Professor John Bridgeman, has developed an optical device that is able to indicate in less than 30 seconds whether water is likely to contain high levels of bacteria and so be unsafe to drink. The device uses a technique called fluorescence spectroscopy to scan the water and highlight pollutants that are present in the sample.
All water fluoresces; a molecule absorbs a high-energy photon and re-emits a lower-energy photon with a longer wavelength. Usually the absorbance is in the ultraviolet range, and the emitted light is in the visible range, but this depends on the particular molecule. Despite being undetected by the human eye as a result of the eye's insensitivity to the appropriate wavelengths, off-the-shelf equipment can detect this fluorescence. A large body of research has demonstrated that water fluorescence is particularly good at identifying faecal contamination. In the laboratory, a range of excitation wavelengths are used and emitted light is detected is detected at the corresponding, longer emission wavelength. The fluorescence intensity is then plotted for each wavelength pair to produce a contour map of fluorescence for the sample.
The focus of the latest research at Birmingham is derived from the widespread observation of intrinsic fluorescence emitted at certain wavelengths in all types of faecal-derived waters; commonly referred to as fluorescence peak T, or tryptophan-like fluorescence. Fluorescence is emitted from tryptophan molecules present as microbial and algogenic cellular material, both living and dead. 
In a diverse range of surface and waste waters, Bridgeman and colleagues have shown that the intensity of this fluorescence correlates with biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), a determinand used by environment agencies worldwide to assess river and wastewater quality. Work with the Environment Agency (EA) in recent years has shown that, for several geographical areas, a correlation exists between peak T fluorescence intensity and the EA water quality grade. Laboratory microbial culture experiments have shown a direct correlation between peak T fluorescence intensity and total microbial cell counts. It has become apparent that peak T fluorescence intensity can be directly related to the ecological health of freshwater. 

The current research programme is building on the previous work where fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to detect sewage in rivers. Now the prototype is being used for the first time to establish bacterial numbers in a wide range of water samples (including river water and effluent from sewage treatment works) and the results compared with those from a conventional bench top fluorescence spectrophotometer. 
Preliminary testing, research and prototype development demonstrate the potential of using a portable fluorimeter as an initial screening tool for indicative microbial water quality, and one that is ideally suited to simple pollution scenarios such as assessing the impact of faecal contamination in river or groundwater at specific sites.
The Group's innovative LED-based instrument, &quot;Duo Fluor&quot; uses inexpensive, off-the-shelf equipment that is portable and so can be used from the back of a 4x4 vehicle which is particularly useful where laboratory facilities are not at hand. Furthermore, there is the ability to have both expert interpretation of results as well as simplified pictorial interpretation for use by non-experts in individual communities. Thus, the innovative approach to improving the efficiency of analysis has the additional benefit of community empowerment through involving poor water users themselves in the application of the technology. 
The research team is now seeking to refine the Duo Fluor design and operational procedures, to make it ideally suited to disaster relief and areas of poor sanitation. By facilitating the timely detection of unsafe sources of drinking water, the Group believes it will be able to offer a reliable technique to help minimize the likelihood of future widespread outbreaks of cholera and other water-related diseases in areas of poor sanitation.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","","Applications to disater relief
Advantages of fluorescence screening of water include rapid analysis time; something urgently needed in disaster relief. The Birmingham work has shown that results can be made available in less than one minute, significantly improving on existing coliform count technology. 
The technological limitation to date has been the need for a portable light source that emits in the ultraviolet range. Bridgeman's team recently overcame this with the production of portable prototype instruments, developed for the analysis of peak T fluorescence and also for peak C fluorescence - which is used as a surrogate for humic and fulvic acid presence. An ideal application of these sensors is the real-time, hand held analysis of the microbiological quality of drinking water, particularly in areas of poor or no sanitation as widely found in developing countries and during disaster relief scenarios.",,"56e057893bb887.67959170","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56e057893bb887.67959170&grantRef=EP%2FI001379%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I001379/1","FEBC0E06-1ED4-42DE-9E4C-AE45AEFD0E66","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","A0F31F31-5F29-4F43-9497-31DF01F580E9"

It is a community and human-rights based approach to assessing and transforming Blue Economy development initiatives into life affirming processes that are equitable and sustainable. Hub researchers are in the process of applying and refining an oceans for life assessment tool and oceans for life action tool which we have developed over the past year. The tool has been applied in one of the University of Cape Town research team case study sites thus far. The purpose of this community-based tool is to provide an understanding of community vulnerability to ocean economy projects and ascertain the knowledge, skills and resources and actions needed to build resilience. 

This resource process includes two inter-linked components:

1. Oceans for Life Assessment Tool which is a dynamic, participatory, human- rights based assessment tool that enables coastal communities to assess Blue Economy developments from a human rights based perspective to check whether the development complies with international and national human rights laws and policies and will contribute to sustaining their lives and that of the ocean upon which they depend; and

2. Oceans for life action tool which equips coastal communities with the information and an array of resources that will assist them in ensuring that Blue Economy policies, developments and processes comply with relevant human rights and environmental legislation and strategies and activities to transform these development processes into actions that will contribute towards equitable and sustainable oceans and coastal life and livelihoods.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2021","This is work in progress.

Instead, the charge state distribution of excited nuclei is detected as a function of plunger distance. This allows for the measurement of nuclear lifetimes that depopulate through transitions that have a low rate of gamma ray emission, such as a in super-heavy nuclei and low energy transitions, that would not have been possible with the standard DPUNS plunger approach.

This work is currently being prepared for publication.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2020","The application of the charge plunger technique to DPUNS will allow for lifetime measurements to be made in super-heavy nuclei that were not previously accessible.

Applying principles of coproduction, the research team and participating residents investigated prevalent and persisting challenges of water shortage, localised flooding, and uncontrolled fire events. The investigation took place in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which, due to the health and safety requirements of social distancing significantly altered the research approach away from the planned face-to-face interviews to a telephonic approach more reliant on community advisory board (CAB) members participatory engagement and subsequent respondent referrals. The adapted methodological approach made use of enhanced involvement of the CAB members, in conjunction with the adaptation of survey research methods that made use of Commcare online research software (https://www.dimagi.com/commcare/research/) with WhatsApp technologies. A technical support team monitored research findings in real-time, and was able to elicit important and valuable insights in the process. Whilst the telephonic interview process did encounter some challenges of a practical nature including communications, technological barriers, and in ensuring that respondents were both eligible and able to participate during the investigation, the adapted research methods were able to achieve an important baseline understanding of the majority world context of the Cape Flats in which such socio-ecological disasters occur. The use of WhatsApp as a survey tool allowed for respondents to take and send photographs in real-time of the various, situated socio-ecological challenges they face. In sites such as Sweet Home Farm, localised flooding was taking place at the time of fieldwork, meaning that interviewees were able to share their own extremely powerful images of this socio-environmental challenge, through their own eyes and from their own perspectives. An important drawback to the approach was the inability of field researchers to witness and experience these challenges directly themselves, limiting, at least to some extent, the physical, social nature of the coproduction research principles being applied.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2020","The methodological research approach acted as a powerful tool to access and dialogue about the lived experiences of disaster risk-affected residents of underserved contexts of the Cape Flats.

Whilst this &quot;GWAFF&quot; technique has been previously described by Byrne et al (2013), they looked at commercial varieties where genetic diversity is likely to be lower and haplotype imputation is feasible. To ensure we hit as many loci as possible at a depth of 50x coverage or higher, we modified the protocol to remove effects of PCR competition and reduce unwanted &quot;bottlenecking&quot; of sample diversity prior to loading samples onto the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform.

Once each pool has been sequenced to final depth (~20 million reads per pool), colleagues at INRA and IPK will perform association analyses with environmental conditions at sample origin, plus phenotypic data from Lemnatec and field trial, in order to identify alleles under selection and identify material useful in creating pre-breeding germplasm for adaptation to climate change.",,"56d6d6c85a27d2.78447213","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56d6d6c85a27d2.78447213&grantRef=BB%2FM018393%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/M018393/1","87B16E9E-3EA5-4CF0-A892-9304D57B34EE","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","E4757A6E-7326-472B-9979-B47D77A65446","3F261A2D-C4F2-486A-9CAD-A93E5C0980D0"

at both company level and system level in order to achieve significant results. A holistic
approach will enable process monitoring and optimization, as well as focus on an
integrated and cross-sectorial interaction that can have a greater impact within the
process industry. MAESTRI project encompasses an Industrial Symbiosis (IS) approach, which,
within the scope of sustainable manufacturing for process industries, fosters the sharing of
resources (energy, water, residues and recycled materials) between different processes of
a single company or between multiple companies.
Findings from previous MAESTRI activities indicate that the appropriateness of the IS solutions
is strongly influenced by contextual factors. Some specific characteristics will shape the
scope and opportunities for IS in a specific context. These include but are not limited to:
company size and production processes, geographical landscape and regional
industrialization as well as country-specific trade regulations and policy. The high degree of
characterization needed for the design of IS in different contexts means practitioners would
benefit from support (e.g. tools and methods) developed specifically to address
contextualization challenges for IS design and planning. There is a need to provide
companies with structured and systematic ways to uncover the latent value in waste
resources and to support the adaptation to each particular business context and the
identification of opportunities at local / regional level.
This document presents the Toolkit for Industrial Symbiosis (T4IS) built upon four guiding
questions, the four HOW TOs: How to SEE waste, How to CHARACTERISE waste, How to VALUE
waste and How to EXPLOIT waste. These guiding questions represent the main steps in a
development process for IS exchanges.
The focus of WP4 within MAESTRI project is to provide companies with methods and tools to
develop self-organising IS to the extent that this is possible. The T4IS described in this
document constitutes a complete first stage prototype tools and methods, capable of
being fully used by industrial partners. This will be refined during MAESTRI demonstration
phase and a final version of the T4IS will be created by the end of MAESTRI project.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2017","Not known","https://maestri-spire.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAESTRI-D4_3_v1_rev.pdf","5aa8f8c31da177.69070134","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5aa8f8c31da177.69070134&grantRef=EP%2FI033351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I033351/1","55AB8CA6-FEC5-48D1-B3D8-13ED830934CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","68F9AC3F-225C-4FAD-A645-C2F5A9BBB85A"

The Participatory Situational Analysis (PSA) was developed in a RRfW mini-project. The PSA approach offers a structured approach to bring together stakeholders from different backgrounds (e.g. government, industry, NGOs, academia) to develop a joined action plan to implement circular economy via change in the governance system. This is a method for a workshop. The PSA session should start with a presentation introducing the vision or technology that is to be implemented (in our case, a shared perspective on the vision/ technology was already developed in earlier stakeholder engagement activities). The session then runs through the stages of: 1) Mapping associated policies and regulations; 2) Drivers and barriers associated with the policies and regulations; 3) Actors in control to reduce barriers and/or capitalise on opportunities; 4) Actions that actors that are in control could take. A final step could be to ask about research and innovation challenges to enable action from the actors in control of the system, resulting in an action-oriented research agenda.

A challenge is to obtain adequate amounts of pure bacterial DNA from environmental samples that are heavily contaminated with plant and animal material among other things. A method has been optimized to obtain adequately pure DNA through a process of filtration and DNA extraction, comparing different approaches at each step. 16s amplicon sequencing can be use to determine the relative abundance of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria in each sample and detect changes in the overall microbial profile between locations with different levels of antibiotic exposure, for example. The whole 16S rRNA gene is approximately 1550 base pairs long and consists of nine variable regions (V1-V9) flanked by conserved regions critical to ribossomal functions. Usually, only one region (v3-v4) is used for species identification but recent studies suggest that the entire genomic region should be used to provide taxonomic resolution of bacterial communities at species and strain level. In this project, we are testing a multiplexed assay that covers all variable regions of the 16S rRNA to increase species identification accuracy in the analysis. The collected information will be used to select the locations more likely to be under strong AMR pollution in aquatic environments that will be further sequencing by metagenomics.","Biological samples","","","No","2022","None at present",,"622f65ea4c3f20.24308236","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=622f65ea4c3f20.24308236&grantRef=NE%2FT013184%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/T013184/1","54806B01-0DC0-4351-894C-F52C6320F7F6","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","A8DCE500-E2C2-4DE7-9228-1E6F2A7F751F"

Cochrane, Professor Warren Potts and Professor Warwick Sauer have developed a tool to measure vulnerability of fisheries to climate change. 

The tool developed in assessing vulnerability and identifying adaptation options is consistent with the standard vulnerability assessment (VA) framework applied by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In accordance with that framework, vulnerability is split into two components, ecological vulnerability and social and economic vulnerability (e.g. Marshall et al., 2009). In addition, for the purposes of this project a third component is also included, referred to as National Economy and Governance. 

The new tool is new and novel because it takes into account social and economic vulnerability data. In contrast to the availability of reliable information on the impacts of climate change on the ecology of Benguela ecosystem and ecological vulnerabilities, there has been little work done, and hence there is only limited information, on the social and economic vulnerabilities of the fisheries of the Benguela countries. Any such information that is available will be examined and used where appropriate but the primary method for this component will be to collect information through consultation with stakeholders, particularly those stakeholders who are directly dependent on the fisheries for their livelihoods, as well as the responsible government agencies. National workshops will be held in each country as a primary tool for consultation but follow-up consultations will also be held with specific stakeholders as required. This will include visits to processing factories to consult directly with factory workers and fishing crews.

In accordance with the standard IPCC practice, social and economic vulnerability is determined as the combination of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. These three indicators are defined as (Sowman et al. 2018):

• Sensitivity: the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate related stimuli;
• Exposure: the nature and degree to which a system is exposed to significant climatic variations;
• Adaptive capacity: the ability of systems, institutions, humans, and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences.

Dynamic economic and environmental dispatches (DEED) are both crucial objectives in this scheduling task because a small percentage improvement may potentially bring significant cost savings and operational improvements. The goal of economic dispatch is to minimize the cost by determining the power production of thermal power plant units, while managing system constraints, balancing power production and load demand, and meeting plant operational requirements, e.g. ramp rates. Similarly, the objective of environmental dispatch is to minimize emissions under the same system constraints. Both dispatch problems are difficult to solve due to the non-smooth non-convex DEED formulations in cost functions and constraints, especially for large power systems. 
Fast development of renewable power sources and changes in load demand bring more planning and operational uncertainties to the grid. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) with high penetrations are potentially important participants in the power system due to the additional large load requirements. The stochastic charging of PEVs may also significantly affect the distribution grid as well as increase the generation costs and pollutants emissions if not managed efficiently. It is therefore of importance to measure the impact of different PEV charging scenarios on the power system and intelligently schedule and dispatch power generation using an optimized DEED system approach. 
A variety of objective and constraint handling methods have been developed to tackle different scheduling scenarios such as static and dynamic dispatch reserve constrained dispatch as well as ELD integrating with renewable energy sources. These non-smooth and non-convex tasks have imposed significant challenges on the conventional optimization techniques. Hence, heuristic approaches are widely used in solving the ELD problem. In this work, four different types of PEV loads including an institute published load profile, peak and off-peak load profiles and a stochastic load profile are integrated into the dynamic economic load dispatch problem and environmental load dispatch problem respectively. A recently proposed meta-heuristic method, namely the teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) is utilized to solve the EELD problem. The four cases of PEV load deployment strategies that shape the charging loads in different time periods are assessed and compared in terms of the total cost and pollutant emissions.
A small scale 5-unit system and a large scale 15-unit system are tested in 24-hour time period. Four different PEV charging scenarios including EPRI predicted charging, off-peak charging, peak charging and stochastic charging profiles with different number of PEV have been integrated in the load demands of both systems. The numerical results show that the new SL-TLBO algorithm is a viable alternative approach for solving both small and large scale dynamic dispatch problems and outperforms other popular heuristic methods and state-of-the-art TLBO variants in the tests on well-known benchmarks and DEED problem with proper parameter tuning.

The study concludes by considering the economic feasibility of aerated wetlands including capital costs, operating and maintenance costs and payback time to help inform business cases.

Obtaining material from patients to study disease molecular mechanisms is extremely difficult, as patients are rare, often children and as anaemic it is not feasible to collect adequate cells samples for study. We created a human immortalised erythroid cell line that recapitulates adult erythropoiesis, and provides a sustainable supply of early erythroid cells. We have now used CRISPR-Cas9 editing to introduce the E325K mutation into this line and have performed extensive characterisation to ensure recapitulation of disease phenotype.

The goal is to simulate what's happen in landfill sites in order to design and validate synthetic landfill microbiomes for enhanced biogas production. Five feedstocks rich in cellulose (Municipal solid waste, Maize, Chicken manure/paper/cow slurry mixture, Food waste and AD sludge), were tested as energy source for the microbial communities obtained from Hafod landfill site and drilled waste obtained from Rouaben site. 
The feedstocks were frozen dried to eliminate liquid phase and keep only the solid material. Then 2% of total solid of each feedstock was added anaerobically to the bioreactors under N2-free oxygen gas, then he bioreactors were sterilized by autoclaving and inoculated anaerobically using Leachate/drilled waste mixture. Finally, Bioreactors were incubated for 28 days under agitation at 150 rpm and at 37 &deg;C. The microbial growth in bioreactors was followed during incubation and a sampling of both gas and liquid phases each 7 days was performed from each bioreactor for physiochemical (pH, fibres analysis, biodegradation products), molecular (DNA based approaches) and cultural (microorganisms isolation) downstream analyses.","Biological samples","","","No","2020","The samples taken out from these bioreactors set up using this tool will be used for the purpose of the characterisation of microbial communities originated and involved in lignocellulose biomass conversion in Landfill sites.

This combination of FEM and DEM provides business benefits because it enables the user to design more reliable practical products and accelerate product development cycles compared with existing simulation tools. This particular software can handle arbitrary object shapes (without having to simplify them to clusters of overlapping spheres or modified regular geometric shapes) and has the potential for further development to incorporate other performance parameters. 
DEM Plus works by solving the equations of motion and of continuum mechanics for rigid and deformable material models of particle behaviour using a transient dynamic multi-body explicit solver method known as the combined finite-discrete element method or FEMDEM.
The advantages of this suite of computer tools include:
• High accuracy model achieved by using actual particle shapes and solving a wide range of physical parameters.
• Avoiding errors caused by clustered or clumped sphere approximations, which tend to introduce bumpy surface behaviours even on flat facetted objects.
• High speed execution to improve productivity in solving industrial optimisation problems,
• Versatile range of particle entry and coalescence options to represent industrial packing processes, 
• Large range of packing analysis statistics and visualisation options. (Including: porosity distribution, coordination number, contact force distribution, and orientation distribution). 
• Deformation and breakages of individual particles can be predicted through capability to generate static stress states within each particle of the packed particle skeleton. 

Existing, off-the-shelf software products specialising in FEM methods alone are unable to integrate contact searches (needed for finding all possible contacting bodies efficiently) and contact force interaction methods sufficiently to compete with DEM and FEMDEM based codes. This is particularly true when the FEMDEM codes are designed for large numbers of bodies and for applications in dynamic multi-body problems. Furthermore, existing DEM software products designed for particulate and bulk handling simulation mainly use clumped spheres which creates inaccuracies.
DEM Plus, available from Imperial, overcomes these deficiencies. It has been developed during a period of over 12 years based on modelling work developed by the AMCG (Applied Modelling and Computational Group at Imperial College London). This has resulted in a highly efficient solver component which is combined with more specialised pre-processing and post-processing modules.

The AMCG has developed additional related research software options that utilse the FEMDEM software solver and may be subject to future license agreements to industry including:
• Code to provide plasticity behaviour, for example containers may behave plastically
• A 3D fracture model which can be used to further understand the breakage of components such as catalyst support structures. 
• A thermal model which can simulate heat conduction within solids and heat transfer due to contact, hence further understand thermal effects.
• An advanced adaptive mesh multipurpose fluid dynamics code that allows the fluid flows and pressure drops through packs to be simulated.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2019","The DEM Plus software has been licensed to a multi-national materials and catalysis processing company that is leading in hydrogen gas production from methane steam-reforming processes.","http://www.solidityproject.com","5c8a3040f13688.64276246","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c8a3040f13688.64276246&grantRef=EP%2FH030123%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/H030123/1","DE2B49CE-0760-4BFF-9603-FD19D68A9CD4","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","4C42AB92-B750-41C5-A97F-4C8AE361EFE7"

The reason is that changes in system inertia, due to changes in outputs from wind and PV generation at different loading conditions will require that the levels of primary frequency response committed change dynamically. In this context,stochastic unit commitment and multi-period optimal power flow methods are investigated and address frequency regulation while taking into account inertia effect, various reserve services (spinning and standing) and energy provision in an integrated manner including energy storage of different technologies. Rather than relying on crude constraints for frequency response, reserve and inertia requirements, for the first time, alternative approaches and forms of setting fine-grained pseudo-dynamic constraints are incorporated in the stochastic unit commitments or multi-period optimal power flows.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","This approach enables quantification of the value of inertia services that energy storage, demand and generation of various technologies may be able to deliver while considering network constraints associated with the location of these resources.",,"58c946f735aa34.27575805","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c946f735aa34.27575805&grantRef=EP%2FL014351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/L014351/1","E18E8B45-801B-40D5-AF7B-6C459F5F2DD1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","06B69545-AB85-4DB9-A2A7-06EBFF58AF78"
"AHRC","AH/P006256/1","Research Grant","Research Tools and Methods","Durham University","Archaeology","Coningham","Robin","","Post-Disaster Rescue Archaeology Toolkits","Located south of the historic city of Deopatan, Pashupati comprises a monumental core of temples, ashrams and funerary ghats covering 83 hectares along the Bagmati River (Michaels and Tandon 1994: 180). As the most sacred Hindu temple in Nepal, Kathmandu's premier cremation location and a major Saivite site in South Asia, Pashupati receives approximately six million pilgrims annually. Challenged by the careful balance between the needs of infrastructure development for pilgrims and tourists and the preservation of heritage, Pashupati also suffered damage to heritage during the 2015 Gorkha earthquakes and, as such, a programme of conservation, renovation and post-disaster rehabilitation was initiated at the site. 

A human catastrophe that devastated lives and livelihoods across Nepal, the Gorkha earthquakes also caused a cultural catastrophe, damaging and destroying monuments within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Pashupati. Whilst the majority of monuments within the main temple complex were not catastrophically damaged when compared with sites across the Kathmandu Valley UNESCO World Heritage Property, several structures within the temple complex sustained significant damage. One of these structures was the Guruju Sattal, a three-storied rest house, located adjacent to the western entrance of the main temple complex. Badly damaged in the initial earthquake, the monument was subsequently 
deliberately demolished to avoid loss of life caused by falling masonry in later aftershocks. 

The spread of rubble over and around the Guruju Sattal's foundations also provided an excellent opportunity for capacity building and the training of first-responders in methodologies and protocols for the protection of heritage and recovery of historic materials during post-disaster scenarios. We therefore undertook a 'live exercise' between the 2nd and 20th December 2016, whereby first-responders to a disaster, including personnel from the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army as well as heritage professionals from the Department of Archaeology, Government of Nepal, and Officers from the site manager, Pashupati Area Development Trust, were provided with training on the collapsed building. The Guruju Sattal's ruins and debris allowed us to replicate a collapsed monument, similar to those encountered in the immediate post-earthquake phase. A year after the 2015 earthquakes, this live exercise also offered the opportunity of capacity building in a safe training environment, giving first-responders the necessary skills and knowledge of post-disaster archaeological methods and protocols to enable the protection of heritage alongside rapid response during search and rescue efforts focused on the injured, trapped or dead.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2017","Having uncovered evidence of earlier phases of monuments and settlements, which would have been lost without rescue excavations in advance of reconstruction, we also recognise that the events of 2015 illustrate the need for capacity building and training. Although rigorous archaeological rescue excavations are now being conducted in the non-emergency phase, there remains a gap in capacity for the protection of heritage in the aftermath of an earthquake. In the immediate aftermath of the Gorkha earthquake it was observed that materials from several monuments were mixed during clearing, including the removal of modern and archaeological material together. This was then removed en masse, with historic material from Hanuman Dhoka's Durbar Square removed by army trucks and dumped unsorted). Whilst humanitarian efforts are of paramount importance, this is a critical phase for the protection of heritage. Therefore, it is imperative that there is training for first-responders in methodologies for the protection of heritage and recovery of historic materials during post-disaster scenarios. There is also an economic aspect to this as newly made brick for heritage construction are currently in short supply and cost an estimated &pound;1.31 each - a huge figure considering the hundreds of thousands of bricks just dumped during UNDP-sponsored clearing. 

During December 2016, a 'live' training exercise' was implemented at Pashupati Temple complex to provide a field laboratory in post-disaster heritage methodologies and approaches to damaged cultural heritage sites. Whilst the majority of monuments at Pashupati were unharmed, some sustained damage. This included the Guruju Sattal, a three-storied rest house, located adjacent to the western entrance of the main Temple complex, which was badly damaged during the earthquake and the unstable structure was deliberately demolished. The spread of rubble over the Guruju Sattal's foundations provided an opportunity to train first-responders in how to manage a heritage site in the emergency phase of a disaster, and included participants from the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army as well as heritage professionals from the DoA, and Officers from the site manager, Pashupati Area Development Trust.

The Guruju Sattal's ruins and debris allowed us to replicate a collapsed monument, similar to those encountered in a post-earthquake phase in a safe training environment. It offered first-responders skills and knowledge of post-disaster archaeological methods and protocols to enable the protection of heritage alongside rapid response during search and rescue efforts. As there was a lack of capacity in the recording, recovery and sorting of archaeological material during the emergency response phase, especially amongst first-responders, who were present on the scene post-disaster and encountered archaeological materials during this very difficult and stressful phase of humanitarian recovery, we aimed to develop a simple methodology that had three key requirements:

1) A method that could be quickly implemented at, and transferred to, any collapsed monument;
2) A rapid methodology which would not impede the recovery of trapped or injured people within a collapsed monument;
3) A method that could be implemented by non-heritage experts without specialist equipment.

Guruju Sattal provided an ideal monument around which to co-produce a methodology and protocols in a non-threatening environment with individuals and groups of first-responders. The following methodology was developed during the live exercise.

As speed is of the essence, the size of the rubble spread from a collapsed monument should be quickly assessed, with this area then gridded into squares. The rationale behind the grid is that any rubble removed can be provenanced to a particular locality within the site. The grid therefore allows for the quick removal of material with a fairly robust known spatial location. A replicated grid is created near the site, mirroring the layout of the trench grid, with rubble moved into the corresponding grid square. This replicated grid can be constructed from bamboo or metal scaffold, or outlined with lime depending on availability of materials in the immediate post-disaster period. In later processing, this means that artefacts, including structural elements, can be spatially reconstructed in the hope that salvaged material could possibly be reused in reconstruction and conservation. 

Before the clearance of debris, a quick photograph is taken using a mobile phone, which is likely to be at hand to many first-responders, especially military and police personnel. To provide a quick scale, any equipment to hand to remove the rubble in post-disaster recovery and clearance efforts, such as a shovel, can be utilised. Rubble is then removed within each square onto the surviving in-situ archaeology below, such as floors or stable old land surfaces, which is also where the injured, trapped and dead would be located. To speed up the removal of rubble, material can be shovelled into sacks. These sacks can then be labelled with a unique identifying number, linked to each grid-square and then deposited in the replicated grid square to be processed during the non-emergency phase. Furthermore, portable antiquities and fragments of sculpture were also given unique special find numbers and removed to a safe locked store nearby. Furthermore, brick and tile, that was not broken or damaged can be stacked by each replicated square so that these can be reused in reconstruction. 

By salvaging bricks, the cost of producing new brick for reconstructions could be reduced, saving money during the very costly reconstruction phase. The PDNA anticipated these &quot;bottlenecks in the supply of timber and special bricks used for restoration&quot; (PDNA 2015: 4) after huge amounts of material was removed from historic sites and dumped in various localities around the Valley following clearance of collapsed monuments. It is also suggested that after this emergency phase, the surviving standing architecture of a monument can be assessed, as can its foundations and earlier cultural sequences, in a research orientated environment prior to reconstruction, as illustrated by our work at Kasthamandap and other monuments across the Kathmandu Valley. During the live exercise at Guruju Sattal, the photographs and records were uploaded to a private Facebook group. This could be accessed by all members to upload their data but also allowed them to see records and photographs uploaded by other members. Furthermore, the group allowed for discussions and communication during the live exercise. We are aware that internet connections might fail during a disaster, as in the days after the earthquake of 25th April 2015, and we are currently developing an off-line app that can be used on a mobile phone for the uploading of data during excavation and the post-disaster emergency response..","https://www.dur.ac.uk/cech/unescochair/research/kathmandu/","58b6786f71b1a4.47422752","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58b6786f71b1a4.47422752&grantRef=AH%2FP006256%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P006256/1","E8C67F72-A7DA-4B8D-BC0F-9F116185E000","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","46B41008-0EB4-4E28-BBFB-E98366999EC5","CCF7DCDB-BD83-47C6-B0B9-898B5F21FC45"

This is a resource to help you improve the coverage and policy wording of green infrastructure in local plans and strategies. It is designed primarily as a self- assessment tool although we can give advice and support as required. 

2. Is this just another new tool?
No it is not.
The assessment framework is a hybrid; a fusion between 3 different research projects all trying to fathom out what good GI looks like. First, an English GI Benchmark ('Building with Nature'), a NERC project developed by the Gloucester Wildlife Trust and the Centre of Sustainable Planning and Environments at UWE (Sinnett, et al., 2018). Second, an Integrated Green Infrastructure Approach (IGI) developed and promoted in Scotland by the Glasgow and Clyde Valley Green Nature Partnership (2017) and third, a NERC funded project on Mainstreaming Green Infrastructure in the planning system which seeks to improve the way GI is valued and used in policy and decision making processes drawing on existing research and practice perspectives (Scott 2018).

3. So how is this hybrid framework structured?
The hybridised framework is represented within a policy matrix focussed on three themes; Integration, Functions and Aftercare. Within these seven GI design elements are identified with dedicated Assessment Criteria (drawn from the three research projects and wider literature reviews) that provide the core focus for the assessment. This collectively signals what good policy in development plans should cover. 

4. What is the goal and purpose of GIPAT?
The goal of the GIPAT is to ensure that there are sufficient policies that explicitly cover the full range of functions (as listed in assessment criteria A-Z) performed by GI which are mainstreamed throughout the document rather than just in the environment section and in one isolated green infrastructure policy. Furthermore, there is a goal to ensure that the GI policies themselves have sufficient clarity and teeth which results in appropriate delivery and action on the ground.

5. So how do I use GIPAT effectively for my local plan or green infrastructure strategy
You can use the matrix to test an existing plan, help assess new policies or to compare and contrast different plans. It requires you assessing the 26 assessment criteria on the GI coverage and the strength of policy wording. A simple three colour scoring approach is used in a designed excel spreadsheet","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","GIPAT was tested and co designed with 40 planners from the West of England in two workshops. They themselves have used the tool to design their new local plan policies and test out their strategic development sites. 
GIPAT has been presented to mutliple audiences including Welsh Govt, Northern Ireland Local Government Association, RTPI. West of England Combined Authority and Essex County Councils are using it to inffrm their own GI strategies and also recommending/requiring its use for local plans 
GIPAT has been used to assess National GI guidance in Wales, England and Northern Ireland and to inform a EU PERFECT policy breif on what good policy for GI looks like. 
GIPAT has been presented at . 
GIPAT has beenrecoemmended for use by the Natural Englands GI stadards project. 
There is clear feedback from users that it is helping planners deisgn more robust and multifunctional policies.","https://mainstreaminggreeninfrastructure.com/project-page.php?green-infrastructure-planning-policy-assessment-tool","5c8298140e0e55.78620112","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c8298140e0e55.78620112&grantRef=NE%2FR00398X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/R00398X/1","CF842AEF-EBA2-421B-BF74-36B62DDCF0D3","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","EF390CF0-ECD3-47D8-B9A8-7602AF319BEE","CC6423BB-AF63-4F29-BDD2-3B86D967509E"

Methods for its determination have traditionally relied on complexation with iron and precipitation, acid digestion and measurement of phosphate concentration, or 31P NMR spectroscopy. Direct determination of phytic acid (and its homologues) using mass spectrometry has, as yet, found limited application to environmental or other complex matrices. The behaviour of phytic acid in electrospray ionisation high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-HRMS) and its fragmentation, both in-source and via collision-induced dissociation, have not been studied so far. This paper reports a novel method allowing the detection of the compound in environmental matrices which provides greater resolution and than the traditional method using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM).

Professor Karina Nielsen was funded in Round 1 of the competitive Open Call funding rounds.
Karina is Chair in Work Psychology at Sheffield University Management School, University of Sheffield. 
The project is also lead by Dr Jo Yarker at Affinity Health at work. Affinity Health at Work is a niche occupational health psychology consultancy and research group. We focus on workplace health and wellbeing, and particularly the role of leadership and people management in these areas.

The project aimed to explore how we can promote sustainable return to work among workers with Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) such as anxiety, depression and adjustment disorders, i.e. help workers sustain work and be productive at work after prolonged sickness absence due to CMDs. According to the OECD, 15% of the working population suffer from CMDs and 50% of workers with CMDs at some point go on long-term sickness absence. Despite remission, workers returning have poorer work functioning and are at risk of dismissals due to low productivity. Sustaining productive and high quality jobs for workers with CMDs is an overlooked problem.

The project resulted in the creation of the 'IGLOO Toolkit', which helps workers sustainably return to work after a period of absence due to mental ill-health.

Further to the outbreak of the COVID19 Pandemic, the tool was reviewed and re-addressed some of the impacts of C19.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2019","The IGLOO Toolkit has already been implemented at RSSB, a company that provides guidance to the rail industry - opening up the tool to approximately up to 240,000 employees.

• Michelle O'Sullivan, who is a clinical psychologist and lead the mental health strategy for the rail industry provided us with a testimony outlining how RSSB had implemented the IGLOO Framework within the company. 

&quot;We have integrated and adapted various tools and resources from the IGLOO framework into our psychoeducational resources for industry. We included the checklists for absence conversations, preparing for return to work (RTW) conversations, and planning the RTW, as well as the walking in someone else's shoes exercise in our line manager training and resource pack. Over 100 rail line managers have now gone through this training, and we hope roll out will be wider in the coming year. We are also including these tools in a line manager resource pack, which will be published in February, which will be freely available to the whole industry, embedding the IGLOO tools in rail specific content.
 
I think the IGLOO framework captures key behavioural strategies that can be applied systemically. What I find particularly helpful about the IGLOO model is how it simplifies what can be quite a complex topic, without over medicalising or making sweeping statements. It provides a common language and understanding of support for people that can have quite different perspectives (specifically thinking about the IGLOO guide for HR/employee/line manager). It helps demystify an intimidating topic for an industry that is only just beginning to get comfortable having these conversations. The supporting tools are concrete, tangible and easy to use.
 
We are continuing to think about how we can translate learning from the IGLOO framework along with our own research on mental health in the industry into interventions to support mental wellbeing in the workplace. I think there is more that we can do with the framework that we haven't even got to yet!&quot;

The record will be stored on-board, removing a need for the paper records and wide plates will be used to avoid disturbance of the soft peat surface and to maintain required accuracy. Two types of survey markers will be used: ? Permanent peat anchor (principal benchmark) a metal rod that goes all the way down to the mineral layer below the peat with a small disc that sits on the surface of the peat. It is designed to maintain stable height, unaffected by peat movement ? Plot anchor, a metal rod about 1.5m long topped with a plate flush, intended to move with the bulk peat. For each 1km2 site an independent levelling network will be established, consisting of: 1) The principal benchmark network, using permanent peat anchors. A total of five benchmarks will be associate with each 1km2 site; three located on the site and two outside in areas of stable ground. Prior to commencing the project InSAR data for the period 2014 - date will be used to check and refine the position of the principal benchmarks. One of those will be also used as a RTK GPS base station and observed continuously for at least 24 hours to establish a cm-level reference to OSGB datum. Those measurements will be used to establish the reference height, used in the subsequent measurements. In the case of the Munsary Peatlands height will also be references to the previous measurements. Subsequently, this network will be re-measured during each of the campaign (every 36 days) and adjusted accordingly. RTK GPS base station will be occupied during the measurements of the microtopographic features plots and site anchors (described below). 2) A supporting network of benchmarks, also using permanent peat anchors. A total of 12-18 benchmarks will be created for each 1km2 site, spaced up to 300m. During each campaign, those will be measured in a smaller loop and connected to one of the principal benchmarks. We expect 35 independent loops based on the quality of the ground between the supporting benchmarks. 3) 20-30 plots representative of the distribution of different microtopographic features (hollows, hummocks, etc.) will be located within focus areas. Size of each plot will be decided based on the nature of the microtopographic feature (grid 1x1 to 5x5m with sampling interval 0.3-1.0 m). Each plot will be accompanied by the plot anchor, located within 3-10m from the plot itself, to provide a link to the principle benchmark network. During each campaign, the height of the plot anchor will be re-established from the nearest supporting benchmark. Each plot (and its grid) will be re-established for each campaign using RTK GPS, with accuracy of 0.02-0.04 m and then levelled using site anchor as reference. As an additional control each plot anchor will be observed, using RTK GPS, for 5min, to reach planar accuracy of 0.01 m. The digital level measures specific points with accuracy dependent on the levelling loop length (level distance back and forth) and stability of the reference benchmarks. With the principal benchmark network accuracy of 0.3mm/km, the plot anchor should maintain the sub-mm accuracy using Least Square Adjustment (LSA).","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2018","Described survey method allows to maintain consistent, sub-mm level including measures of accuracy and precision, height reference between the survey campaigns and monitor cm level planar position of the plots and plot anchors addressing both the need to verify large area InSAR accuracy, based on calculation of average subsidence determined Digital Levelling for each InSAR 100x100 m area, as well as accounting for peatland heterogeneity.

The research guide covers the concepts and methods designed for the mixed methods study of transformative sustained escapes from extreme poverty in Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia. Being the study comparative, a key is to ensure that the understanding of concepts, categories of analysis and use of field methods is consistent across the three east African country teams, and that the categories of analysis cohere between the quantitative and qualitative analysis (where possible). 

After discussing /defining research hypotheses and key aims, the guide moves onto a discussion of key concepts and their methodological implications, namely, how concepts help us define the dimensions of the study, this includes, 
• time (how long escaped), 
• magnitude of escape (measured as distance from extreme poverty based on monetary, multidimensional and/or well-being ladders), 
• space (choosing regional sub-samples) and 
• structural groupings of people (ethnicity, gender, age, disability).

The guides then analyses the methods which address the causes of sustained escapes, discussing the quantitative analysis of panel data. This focuses on measurable factors and then moves from factors to combinations of factors (or recipes) through, for instance, qualitative comparative analysis which gives several 'recipes; for sustained escape in each country. Qualitative analysis can support findings on factors and recipes and enables to understand how both fit into pathways and contextually based processes of sustained escape. 

Additionally, the guide turns to the qualitative research protocol and begins with comments on how to proceed with the political economy analysis. This includes: (i) interviews with policy makers regarding the evolution of settlements and their impact on sustainable escapes, (ii) choice of key policies to evaluate (iii) their evaluation in the life histories and (iv) qualitative comparative analysis used to explore how different types of political economy settlements affect directly and indirectly the nature and causes of sustained poverty escapes. 

Lastly, the guide discusses the protocol for gathering community and life histories and associated key informant interviews. It covers the techniques of the qualitative inquiry into sustained escapes and subsequent write up. Analysis will of these histories will use traditional approaches as well as process tracing.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2015","buinvreob",,"56d5b745aebd66.60752789","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56d5b745aebd66.60752789&grantRef=ES%2FM009351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/M009351/1","69245E5D-5A3F-407C-8BE4-613974E39BF0","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","C3FA5CCF-C8C0-4250-96AE-C676B53492A7","7E643B56-8742-43CC-8F33-B6EC997AEA3F"

The invitation was open to both academics and creative industry representatives who had an interest in this area and digital public space including architects, artists, technologists, social studies and urbanism academics and many others.

The goal of the activity was not only to create project concepts but also to build relationships and successful cross-sector interdisciplinary teams. When designing the experience and activities, our priorities based on previous learnings across the Creative Exchange were to provide a safe environment with all partners on equal footing, and to provide engaging experiences that would spark idea generation and form research teams. 

A process of iterative development informed the design of specific tools to meet these goals. These tools included tangible objects to facilitate mechanisms of collaboration. Tools included: 'Hearts and Hats', 'Link Map', 'Thematic Walk', 'Partners Pie' and the 'Journey Booklet'.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2014","As a result of this event two collaborative projects were funded through The Creative Exchange:

Near Miss: this collaboration between the University of Westminster and SME Blaze ran a national digital survey on cycling 'near misses' and their impact on cyclists. It held a summation workshop with key stakeholders in this area to present the research outcomes and produced a report which has gained significant coverage in the UK press. They have now secured additional funding to extend the survey and include international aspects.

Paths of Desire: this involves researchers from Lancaster University, Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Kent as well as Lancaster City Council, a digital design company and a fine artist. They are developing a new map application which displays locations based on experiences and interests of users. This unique prototype app is in final development stages and will be developed further by the SME partner.

Additional informal connections have been made and sustained between participants forming the basis of a network of collaborations who continue to discuss shared topics and may enable future working.

Long term impacts of this project include the learning which has been retained within The Creative Exchange both in terms of working practices for the doctoral students and methods taken forward to other ideation and collaboration workshops and events. The tools themselves may also be transferrable to other contexts and we are exploring cross sector opportunities for this.

The gas-catalyst reactions take place at the atomic level. World leading fundamental science of the gas-catalyst reactions at the atomic level under controlled reaction environments is therefore needed to understand and develop improved catalysts and processes to support internationally competitive chemical process industries in the UK. 

The importance of heterogeneous catalysis is recognised in EPSRC research theme roadmaps (as one of the relatively few established areas of science continuing to be selected to GROW) and the field supports the very competitive catalysis industry in the UK. 

As part of our very successful EPSRC grant EP/ EP/J018058/1 we (the PI and CoI (Professor Gai and Professor Boyes) have invented, designed, constructed the world's first aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC ESTEM) instrumentation at Yok. This project has established in the UK the world's first atomic resolution (AC) E(S)TEM capability. The main goals as well as some useful key extensions of our ambitious project have been fully accomplished on the planned timescale and resource base to create a new world leading facility and use it to enable important new science highly pertinent to the science behind heterogeneous catalysis based on metal nanoparticles. The ground-breaking AC ESTEM capabilities include, atomic scale imaging and analysis under controlled realistic reaction conditions of gas environment around the specimen held at high temperature with single atom sensitivity, energy dispersive x-ray chemical analysis and wide angle electron diffraction (including CBDP), as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).
We are exploiting the catalyst science relevant to the UK industry, instrumentation and methods using the ESTEM [3-8, 10-12, 14,15]. The project is designed to generate for the first time and in close collaboration with the UK catalysis and chemicals industry, fundamental and practical atomic scale understanding of key preparative, activation, reaction, deactivation and where practical reactivation processes. Analysis of real world practices show considerable scope for improvement in deploying resources, including the amount of precious metals needed for automotive exhaust emissions controls. We are also making our ESTEM development available to colleagues in the UK academia and in collaborations internationally.
The modern era in the field started with the development of the atomic resolution, TEM only, gas-in-microscope ETEM (Environmental Transmission Electron Microscope, ETEM), introduced by Boyes and Gai in the USA in the 1990s [1, 2]. The model is now widely used in commercial form (FEI) at a unit cost of ~&pound;5M; with ~20x based on our work, further instruments being acquired and &gt;100 high impact publications now resulting. There are dedicated units in Asia, USA and Europe, in academia and industry, but currently there are none in the UK and our ESTEM development is the first such instrument in the UK. 
(Described in the Details section below).
(In Manchester, Johnson Matthey/Harwell) there are two limited commercial gas specimen holder systems, based on the work of Cremer [16a] and Bigelow [16b,19], but with limited gas-handing and analytical capabilities).

Under the EPSRC ESTEM Catalysis grant, EP/J018058/1 we have constructed and have begun to apply key technical developments on the core aberration corrected JEOL 2200 STEM (+TEM) electron microscope. For the first time globally using an electron microscope, catalysts can be analysed with sub-&Aring;ngstrom resolution and reliable single atom sensitivity under a selected sub-set of controlled chemical reaction conditions [3-6]. Continuous gas exposure floods the catalyst with reactants at elevated temperature under dynamic real time in-situ reaction conditions. 
With the just concluded York grant EP/J018058/1 the ETEM has been given a very significant application driven redesign to include for the first time a full set of previously absent but scientifically informative ESTEM imaging and analytical functions. We have made opportunistic custom modifications to a 200KV JEOL 2200FS platform, with Cs aberration correction for both the TEM image and STEM probe, to create the powerful and global pioneer ESTEM (Environmental Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope) with full STEM imaging and analysis. It has been created in-house at modest cost, since the core instrument and specialised site capital investments were already in place, and it operates under controlled working catalyst conditions of high temperature and continuously flowing gas sample environment [3, 4].:

Development of our novel AC E(S)TEM instrument:
With the support of the previous EPSRC grant, EP/J018058/1, and derived from the approach we developed for the original atomic resolution ETEM [1 ,2], we have designed and built in-house in York the world's first aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). It is designed to provide ground breaking new capability and new levels of analysis in heterogeneous catalysis; targeted to new developments in catalysis science understanding and practice. It is a powerful new class of instrument with single atom sensitive analyses under controlled continuous gas reaction conditions at high temperatures. 

To achieve this we have modified an existing AC TEM/STEM instrument to complement and extend its capabilities with gas reaction studies while maintaining, and in some aspects extending the full performance and functionality of the core tool. Our new design provides the world's first full function aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). The global competition (approx. 20 labs, all overseas -including Europe, USA, Japan) continues to use a version of our (Boyes and Gai) earlier ETEM design which is in practice high resolution in TEM only and come with a single aberration corrector for TEM imaging. The old design has significant analytical and imaging limitations which make it unsuitable for multi-user environments; to the extent several laboratories have a dedicated machine (as we did with the original) and second instrument for other uses. This is expensive in both capital and operating costs as well as in real estate and support needs. 
With the modifications to the machine at York, ETEM is also (re-) introduced into the UK in high resolution form. Perhaps more significantly, cost-wise, the full ESTEM functionality also supports full STEM for the parallel high vacuum operations. This in itself is major advantage of the new developments which not only enable the new functionalities but also support a much wider and more intensive utilisation of the capital kit investment in multi-use applications, as well as ensuring the support coats are spread over as wide a range of applications as possible. In association with partners in the vibrant UK chemical and energy industries we are generating fundamental application science underpinning nanoparticle based solid state heterogeneous catalysis used in gas-solid reactions. Our primary industry partners are Johnson Matthey Plc.
With the award of the grant in 2012 we began construction of modifications beyond the very limited proof-of-principle demonstrations for gas operations on the multi-use high resolution microscope in our laboratory at York. The year 2013 saw the launch of our aberration corrected ESTEM as a scientifically useful capability. Further improvements to the new core capability and to support other uses of the capital kit, with a minimum of compromises and crucially without the need to change the machine configuration for different applications, are continuing. For example there is a simple and rapid switch over from gas-mode to high vacuum mode.
Phase one technical developments on the microscope were successfully completed and they have produced a first high profile application publication by E D Boyes and P L Gai et al in Annalen der Physik in June 2013. With the developments we have created a world leading new ESTEM functionality without compromising other attributes for these and other applications on the existing high vacuum multi-user machine. 
Recent progress with the new generation of MEMS hot stages we have been able to purchase with the grant (substituting for part of the originally proposed old technology), has been transformational in what we can do scientifically, in productivity and with most of the technical support by ourselves on site rather than regular sagas of return- to-foreign-factory for service. This development makes it practical to track areas continuously over time and during temperature transits, with especial relevance to comparison data for the MC calculations; themselves not part of the project but augmenting it through studentships.

Summary of Approach

Atom-by-atom analysis of dynamic catalysts in controlled reaction environments
The world's first sub-Angstrom atomic resolution Aberration Corrected Environmental Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (AC ESTEM) has been designed built and applied by Professor Gai and Professor Boyes, very economically based on the existing conventional high vacuum 200kV JEOL 2200 FS instrument with aberration correctors for the TEM image and STEM probe. It probably remains the only combination globally of the ambitious specification of retaining, and in important ways enhancing, the full performance and resolution of the original core instrument and improving aspects of the analysis capability while adding controlled continuous hot stage and gas atmosphere dynamic in-situ chemical reaction facilities at the sample; supported by multiple stages of differential pumping. 
 With the new instrumentation created under the EPSRC grant we have delivered major scientific applications in catalysis science for which we designed the novel AC ESTEM system - see for example the references to this report numbers [4-7;11,12,14,15], with others in preparation for publication. 
World leading research has been enabled by the also world leading instrument innovations and suitable engineering and support structures. This has probably involved more in-house development of the instrumentation than in any other laboratory outside Japan; and even of most (all?) there too. The reasoning for adopting this approach has been multi-fold: to support innovative competitive advantages for York's research capabilities; to tailor this to specific project needs and for its own sake; to speed up innovation compared to trying to work with manufacturer lead developments and worse for a small team to simply follow in a moneywise costly manufacturer lead programme like everyone else and also inevitably not to be at the head of that queue. A further driver has been to try to make best use of limited resources and in the process follow the only available path for the innovations in capability development and science applications to happen in York and perhaps in the UK at all. Certainly, without massive additional resources. Finally, this approach is built on York strengths, both in the immediate team and institutionally, in the way we can best provide competitive advantage for ourselves, for the science, for the UK and we suggest for the well-directed funding from the EPSRC.
 The key science application result is currently seen to have been to reveal the continuing presence of a population of single atoms on the support between established more substantial nanoparticles, e.g. of Pt or Cu on carbon, but likely also more generally, at temperature in a gas atmosphere under controlled in-situ dynamic chemical reaction conditions. This is a major result with many implications and directions for further applications.
 In the AC ESTEM samples of catalytic materials can follow a similar profile to that typical in a full scale chemical reactor with transfer of precursor(s) under air, it's subsequent activation in a continuous in-situ sequence inside the microscope (or it's directly connected antechamber) under the appropriate (often hydrogen) gas atmosphere followed by reaction which over time may lead to some deactivation with potential for amelioration better informed by the intimate new atom-by-atom analysis of the basis of the processes. This contrasts with other approaches involving cycling of samples through air and high vacuum environments or of restricted microscopy functionalities.
 The project has been structured around a series of strategic strands, extended with tactical sub-strands, based on the novel capabilities at York for environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy (ESTEM) with atomic resolution and sensitivity:

• Atomic scale characterisation of real, industry sourced, catalyst materials and processes
• Fundamental studies of processes, including revisiting basic models, on the atom-by-atom scale using model samples based on industrial process chemistry and focus issues
• Development of infrastructure, instrumentation and methods to enable the research
• Promoting collaborations with UK and overseas colleagues to widen impact of the ESTEM development.
Additional details of research:
We are exploiting in catalyst science relevant to UK industry, instrumentation and methods created under the very successful EPSRC ESTEM Catalysis critical mass grant, EP/J018058/1 now concluding. With this we have invented, designed, constructed and have begun to apply key technical developments on the core aberration corrected JEOL 2200 STEM (+TEM) electron microscope. For the first time globally using an electron microscope, catalysts can be analysed with sub-angstrom resolution and reliable single atom sensitivity under a selected sub-set of controlled chemical reaction conditions [3-6]. Continuous gas exposure floods the catalyst with reactants at elevated temperature under dynamic real time in-situ reaction conditions 
 With the just concluding York grant the ETEM has been given a very significant application driven redesign to include for the first time a full set of previously absent but scientifically informative ESTEM imaging and analytical functions. We have made opportunistic custom modifications to a 200KV JEOL 2200FS platform, with Cs aberration correction for both the TEM image and STEM probe, to create the powerful and global pioneer ESTEM (Environmental Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope) with full STEM imaging and analysis. It has been created in-house at modest cost, by the approach and since the core instrument and specialised site capital investments were already in place, and it operates under controlled working catalyst conditions of high temperature and continuously flowing gas sample environment [3, 4]. 
 Technically the most noteworthy recent development in the field has been the introduction by the authors of this proposal using the new tool for the first reliable detection of the seemingly general continuing presence of single atoms and small clusters on a support between larger nanoparticles in a typical heterogeneous solid state gas reaction catalyst. To date this is best demonstrated by the important, as well as more generally illustrative, Pt-C system [4], and in quantitative exploitation of the method for Cu [7]. Ground breaking quantitative dynamic atom-by-atom analysis for Pt particle coarsening in hydrogenation reactions is being developed. These results, enabled by the novel York ESTEM instrument developments, are the first reliable single atom sensitive STEM or TEM data under representative operating conditions of a continuous gas atmosphere and controlled high temperature. The new results will be used to inform key catalyst activation, operating and deactivation mechanisms at a new level of atom-by-atom analysis of the direct causes influencing Ostwald Ripening deactivation by atom migration between fixed particle centres. They will extend the prior art TEM studies which have been on a much longer (nm) scale of the coarsening consequences for nanoparticle size growth. The new results will be used to guide how processes might be better controlled and bad outcomes moderated. The impact is potentially worth &pound;Bns in monetary and environmental value. It derives from new insights into the creation of novel strategies which might be used to restrain, or control, key negative impact process variables. The results complement and extend STM work [17], which is generally on ideal substrates with a very restricted range of (small) particle sizes and forms, and replaces much less reliable attempts to use ETEM [18] or high vacuum STEM. As pointed out by the authors [11], even reliable detection, and much less measurement, of &lt;2nm size particles (which are most of the mechanistically important ones) on a support, can be difficult to even detect with the usual bright field EM methods, but the sensitivity of high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM imaging available in the ESTEM has been extended down to the single atom level under a sub-set of realistic catalyst operating conditions [4]; noting there is no real TEM equivalent of high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM.
 Working with industrial partner Johnson Matthey Plc we have previously shown [11] that in extended (47,000 mile) real world use on the road, and mirrored in in-situ experiments, the mean size of Pt/Pd particles in a diesel oxidation exhaust emission catalyst (DOC) on an alumina-based support increased from 2.5 to 11(&plusmn;0.2)nm with a corresponding large reduction in surface area available for reaction. There were also changes in structural character with higher and less reactive Pt-Pt surface co-ordination; and Pd surface enrichment in the Pt/Pd system [11]. This is revealed with precision EDX analysis introduced to the ETEM/ESTEM world with the York development. Over time, catalyst efficacy may be reduced by an order of magnitude or more; or to &lt;10% of the starting state. There is of course in this a massive impact opportunity technically, economically and in the environmental consequences of potentially needing to use much less rare Pt if the new learnings could be used to maintain more nanoparticle surface area, and thereby application catalyst efficiency; either directly or in new opportunities made possible if deactivation processes can at least be made slower; and ideally of course stabilised completely.
 The newly discovered 'intermediate' species of disordered rafts and clusters down to the single atom level may have different and in some cases more useful reactivity to similar atoms bound on to more established (1-2nm in size and up) fully developed 'bulk-like' crystalline nanoparticles [3,7]. 
 The isolated atoms and surface excrescences, or similar residuals, may be a small fraction of the whole, but they can be expected to have a disproportionately strong effect by being continuously exposed to the gas environment [3, 8,10]. We will now be able to directly investigate the basis of single atom catalysis, for the first time under working conditions, likely leading to the discovery of new mechanisms, and from them we should get new and improved processes; and/or learn how to manage old ones better. Other labs around the world are at the highest resolution restricted to using either ETEM without a probe corrector, or much STEM (or EDX) capability at all, or to using a high vacuum STEM in which samples are exposed to different conditions in transfer and analysis and continuing in-situ methods are of unknown reliability in a reaction atypical high vacuum environment. The relatively new commercial MEMS holders, with gas containing windows [16a,b] are more limited in imaging and analytical performance. The mobile atoms, revealed for the first time in the ESTEM at York using a gas environment with a hot stage [3-6,12], have been shown [7] to modify the previously accepted version of the detailed model of Ostwald Ripening (OR) deactivation mechanism at lower operating temperatures [20,21]. This finding, if confirmed and extended to the single atom level, has profound implications for understanding, and eventually perhaps constructively controlling, or at least usefully influencing, the OR process on a new atomistic level. Just slowing it down even by small amounts would be extremely valuable in highly leveraged economic and environmental terms. 
 An additional important aspect of catalyst activation, referred to in the above, is the reduction of copper oxide Cu2O to Cu metal [15]. The highly reactive surface of copper nanoparticles is protected from the outside atmosphere by an oxide film and the catalyst is only prepared for action when the protective oxide layer is stripped off by treatment with H2 gas. We follow in the ESTEM a similar procedure to that used on a chemical plant, e.g. to prepare a methanation catalyst for action. 
 
The project goals have been focused on using disruptive existing experimental ESTEM tools at York, to gain new and transformative single atom level insights into the dynamic properties of nanostructures at the heart of heterogeneous catalyst performance, and in the emerging field of single atom and very small cluster catalysis. The results are contributing to a better focused scientific understanding of key solid state catalyst materials for gas reactions. The direct value of catalysts produced worldwide in 2015 is estimated [to be &gt;&pound;10B pa, with trillions of dollars of product outputs, and economic and environmental opportunities to improve outcomes with wide societal benefits [Re: Royal Society of Chemistry Catalysis estimates, 2010)].

The science the our ESTEM is opening up open up is exciting. AC ESTEM provides a key tool for the study of single atoms in catalysts under reaction conditions with the ability to analyse the structure of the nanoparticles. This is a novel and very important development in terms of impact. As well as new information on the migration of materials from one discrete, in this case metal, nanoparticle to another; it shows the importance of these species leading to active sites. This work relates to parallel on-going Monte Carlo (MC) calculations and provides important input for further calculations of functionality and specific chemical reactivity; through for example the density functional theory (DFT) methods we used for catalytic nanoparticles (at that time studied with temperature and without gas) in our 2012 Nanoletters paper (vol. 12, p.2027 [13]).
Based on the novel ESTEM development of Boyes and Gai, the Nanocentre has been successful with a major EPSRC grant (EP/S033394/1) in 2019, for &pound;3.2M supplemented by a further &pound;1M from the University of York, to replace the old technology aberration corrected environmental STEM/TEM instrument dating from 2005 with a new core instrument to be delivered 2Q2021. Our full partnership with EPSRC SuperSTEM Consortium is continuing as the in-situ ESTEM component of the EPSRC National facility for aberration corrected electron microscopy. We have carried out visualisation of reaction kinetics in shape controlled nanoparticles at the atomic level using our ESTEM development (J.Phys,Chem.C. 123 (2019) 14746. We have detailed our recent work in the leading ACS journal: Boyes and Gai et al. Accts. Chem. Res. 53 (2020) 390

Sintering of catalytic nanoparticles: particle migration or Ostwald ripening?","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2014","The grant holders of - EP/J018058/1, Professor Gai, and Professor Boyes' track record as world leaders in this field has been recognised as follows. 

During the period, Professor Gai has been elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng) and she was awarded the L'Oreal-UNERSCO Women in Science award as the 2013 Laureate for Europe for excellence in the physical sciences in the continent of Europe. (One woman scientist's work is selected from each continent).
Professor Boyes has been elected to Fellowship of the Institute of Physics (FInstP);and was appointed to the EPSRC sponsored committee membership on the future of advanced electron microscopy in the UK.

The recognition has come in the invitations to deliver keynote and plenary papers at The Materials Society of America (MRS) meetings in San Francisco (2014/PLG) and in Phoenix, AZ, (2016/EDB), at the Microscopy Society of America meeting in Portland, OR, (2015/EDB) and an Evening Discourse (2014/PLG) at the Royal Institution of Great Britain.
Numerous Publications and organisation of the International at the IOP EMAG Conference in York, 2013 with plenary and key-note papers [6]; and others have also resulted. 

Full partnership with EPSRC SuperSTEM Consortium:

Largely on the basis of this project, York has been invited to become the first and so far only new full partner in the consortium of Universities running EPSRC's National Facility for Aberration Corrected Electron Microscopy, or SuperSTEM, and in the process to extend the access of other user groups to the unique facility at York. Work has so far been done in collaboration with the Universities of Leeds, Oxford and UCL in the UK, and with Cadiz (Spain) and Nagoya and Okinawa (Japan). 

Collaboration with UK Industry:

There has been significant industrial collaboration leading to joint publications with Johnson Matthey Plc (JM), a FTSE 100 company and world leader in precious metals and catalysis. JM was also a strong supporter of our grant proposal and the interaction continues to be further strengthened at the strategic and tactical levels. The latter include CASE studentships, access to their extensive technical resources for both specimen preparation (including custom preparation to our specifications where needed) and testing, and regular direct technical work for which they pay the University. Based on the novel ESTEM development of Professor Boyes and Professor Dame Pratibha Gai, the York Nanocentre has been successful with a major EPSRC grant (EP/S033394/1) in 2019, to replace the old technology instrument dating from 2005 with a new core instrument to be delivered 2Q2021. Professor Gai and Prof Boyes have been elected Fellows of the Microscopy Society of America in 2019.",,"58c570273f9cb9.42704684","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c570273f9cb9.42704684&grantRef=EP%2FJ018058%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/J018058/1","9A528E8A-57F1-4789-85E7-DAFD8B26D953","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","8319F78A-DCBD-49F6-BE00-78E1CD75CDA9","FAD8807D-3514-42C6-947A-71E8FE40A035"

This tool involved the printing of A1 size, laminated, standardized maps (created in QGIS) of our community study sites (scale was set at 1:18,000). As a participatory tool, participants used markers to identify areas on the maps in response to our questions. Our main focus was to 1) Spatially locate sources of ecosystem services for livelihoods and relevant flows for local use and trade/market, and 2) Understand resource access and control issues that might emerge from resource harvesting activities.

Despite the potential for exposure misclassification, HAP has still been demonstrated to be associated with a wide range of health conditions, including cancer. For communities where the predominant current domestic fuel is biomass, use self-reported fuel/ stove use to infer exposure will make it difficult to tease out exposure-outcome relationships due lack of variability in levels of HAP exposure. Whilst this could be overcome by measuring actual levels of exposure objectively (as we are doing in a sub-sample for HAP ESCCAPE), such measurement is costly and intensive. Furthermore, in the aetiology of cancer we are interested in longer term exposure rather than current levels. Therefore, obtaining a differential and detailed life history of potential HAP exposure might be important in providing the granulation and chronicity of exposure necessary to understand these relationships. To attempt to address this we developed a comprehensive questionnaire designed to assess lifetime exposure to HAP, from cooking, heating and lighting sources. 

The first phase of questionnaire development involved consultation with leading international HAP experts (e.g. Dr Om Kurmi, McMaster University) following a structured literature review and thematic discussions within the energy, air pollution and health research group. Accordingly, we developed a pilot questionnaire, designed to link recollection of participants' exposure to potential sources of HAP with key life phases/ events (e.g. childhood, while in school, first job, etc.). The pilot questionnaire was administered to 30 individuals from our study community and was refined based on their feedback to develop the main study exposure questionnaire. This version was administered as a 'rolling pilot' in the study setting (hospital), to the first 20 cases and 20 controls, with minor amendments to the questionnaire being made based on their responses. We have now collected this retrospective exposure information from 100 cases and 60 controls out of the target 225 cases and 225 controls. 

The questionnaire is administered in a dynamic adaptive format - follow up questions are presented to the participant only when relevant based on their previous answers, to minimise the administration time. There are three broad components of the questionnaire. In the first component, the participant is asked about present cooking, heating and lighting devices, fuels and habits in their household, as well as whether they are the main cook in the household. If they confirm being the main cook, an additional set of questions is asked, assessing their cooking habits (e.g. how many times in a day/week they cook, what is the average cooking time per meal, etc). Next, the participant is asked about general HAP circumstances they can recall from their childhood (for example, whether they slept by the burning fire as a child in addition to cooking and heating habits if their childhood home). Finally, the questionnaire is designed to detect any significant changes in HAP circumstances between childhood and the present day, by asking a series of questions about any relevant changes and participant's age at change. This novel approach enables detection and subsequently modelling of each individual's specific circumstances in terms of HAP exposure during their lifetime. The questionnaire will be made publicly available for future use after the data collection phase is completed and metric characteristics of the questionnaire (reliability, validity) assessed.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2019","Unfortunately the life course analysis of differential exposure to household air pollution (wood smoke) afforded by the questionnaire has not helped in disentangling the extent of cumulative exposure in the cohort of cases and controls for HAP ESCCAPE with almost all homes currently cooking with wood (and indicating exposure through proximity to smoke as a child and adult) being exposed to wood smoke all their lives (from childhood, adolescence and adulthood). Without more variation over time (e.g. people changing their choice of cooking fuel to cleaner alternatives such as LPG) it is not possible to highlight more granularity on exposure to tease out exposure-response relationships. The tool is likely to be more effective in settings where there is a greater use of gas/ electricity for clean cooking (with earlier transition to cleaner modern energy) - e.g. urban settings.",,"5e5e8d1ecbf310.79313235","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e5e8d1ecbf310.79313235&grantRef=MR%2FS009051%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/S009051/1","EB207600-5E6D-436E-BC64-5721A4A0AC4C","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","A0A585E0-6B0D-4643-A3A6-47943B4CBFEF","1D8B4152-3CD9-4A48-8BDA-D57E6C4BBC2D"

As the total mass in the system is unknown, due to leakage between the cylinder and the piston, it is necessary to measure three thermodynamic bulk parameters in order to completely determine the system state. Pressure, temperature and volume are convenient choices. However there is a challenge in measuring the gas temperature in the compression space using traditional physically invasive methods, such as thermocouples. These methods generally have a number of undesirable side effects; for example their poor response times due to the added thermal mass, their sensitivity to the varying heat transfer in the cylinder, the disruption of the gas flow and gas temperature, and the fact that they only provide a point measurement of the flow.

In this facility a novel technique is developed for the measuring of the temperature of the gas by measuring the time of flight of an ultrasonic pulse across the compression space. The technique is based on the principal that the speed of sound in an ideal gas is dependent on the square root of the absolute temperature, based on which the temperature of the gas along the ultrasonic path can be found. The ultrasonic pulse is transmitted and received at 400 kHz using piezo ceramic transducers with a repetition rate of 2 kHz.

The EV-involved system should include automobile manufactories, public utilities including transportation systems, gas stations as well as the behind networks to supply oils, battery charging stations as well as the behind electric power systems and the environment system. Key participants are travelers, automakers, charging service providers, power grid companies and policy makers, etc. Travelers can be further classified into 2 types: the strongly controllable ones including taxi drivers, public transportation suppliers, etc. who earn money directly from transportation service, the weakly controllable ones mainly referring to drivers who use cars for private purposes. The former ones has better responses to policies than the latter ones. 
The use of oil-powered vehicles need support from gas station networks, and produce emissions to the environment. EVs need support from charging station networks whose power is fed by the power system. Because the use of EVs is expensive and contains low efficiency, e.g. the charging process is much longer than the refueling process, policy makers have to provide subsidies to EV manufacturers or customers. If not doing so, customers will not buy EVs and manufacturers have no passions to continue upgrading and expand production for EVs, which delays the EVs to become better and cheaper. As another consequence, charging stations remain poor popularity, the power system is still not friendly to EVs, and the environment continues enduring the emission from vehicles. Therefore, the dead cycle of the whole system is only reinforced. It is costly to break the dead cycle in the current technical conditions. Modeling the system and understanding the behaviors of key participants will help minimize the pain in the energy transition process.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","A very useful framework to study the impact of EV on our society.",,"56d8b2810f6b14.88573444","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56d8b2810f6b14.88573444&grantRef=EP%2FL001063%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/L001063/1","34FFD228-2F72-461E-AD54-A92D2D826225","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","EC23DA53-CA73-4104-A3F6-2A9523484E69","805BF1A0-B634-4558-BA5E-9CB38293A4AC"

HAP ESCCAPE seeks to objectively measure current exposure to the health damaging components of HAP that could affect respiratory health (particulate matter (PM) and have carcinogenic properties (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)). To do this we use state of the art monitoring equipment suitable for measuring HAP both in terms of concentration (e.g. indoors/ kitchen) and for personal exposures (PM2.5 - PM of 2.5 microns or less). UoL has a unique partnership with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) who have developed small, lightweight gravimetric air pollution monitoring devices (MicroPEMs) that collect PM2.5 samples over specified recording periods (e.g. 24 hours) and measure real time levels of PM2.5 through laser light-scatter. The microPEMs that can measure average levels of PM2.5 over a 24hr period and, through careful management of the collected samples, allow extraction of levels of PM2.5-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) for the sampling period. Analysis of PAHs (organic compounds that are causally implied in cancer aetiology) will help establish the mechanism of any association identified between HAP exposure and esophageal cancer. We have developed methods to deploy this instrumentation for minimal inconvenience for the study participants (microPEMs being warn on a harness or in an apron during the recording period). We have also developed standardised protocols for effective training of fieldstaff.

For HAP ESCCAPE we aim to collect objective data on HAP from 50 cases and 50 controls that are either women or male younger than 40 years old (current recruitment is at 12 cases and 5 controls). Importantly, for some cases, it will no longer be possible to carry out the domestic tasks they previously undertook (including cooking) due to ill health. In this situation, domestic proxies (relatives or friends who have assumed the cooking responsibilities) will be recruited to wear the air pollution monitoring equipment for the recording period. 

Ultimately, we plan to work with IARC to (i) compare levels of HAP to WHO guideline levels and (ii) produce a current and lifetime HAP exposure prediction model which will then be applied to the full case-control study (625 cases and 625 controls).","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2019","N/A",,"5e5e8de5426299.42039772","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e5e8de5426299.42039772&grantRef=MR%2FS009051%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/S009051/1","EB207600-5E6D-436E-BC64-5721A4A0AC4C","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","A0A585E0-6B0D-4643-A3A6-47943B4CBFEF","1D8B4152-3CD9-4A48-8BDA-D57E6C4BBC2D"

Developed in the 1970s by Motorola, technology roadmapping was developed when firms faced different challenges to the present resource constrained world. As such, this research has focused on identifying how the tool can be updated to help firms recognise and manage the impact of future resource constraints on their business. The revised tool guides participants through a series of simple activities to help them recognise how the availability of vital resources will impact their current product lines. The simple visual structure of the roadmap encourages participants to recognise how future resource shortages will place particular product lines at risk, encouraging them to reconsider their strategic vision. This could involve investing in alternative or low-resource technologies. In essence, the tool helps manufacturing firms devise more sustainable business strategy for a resource-constrained world.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2014","The tool has been used in workshops with industry over the past year and has helped businesses incorporate considerations of potential resource shortages while development of future business strategies.",,"545a16b28a3979.78079458","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=545a16b28a3979.78079458&grantRef=EP%2FI033351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I033351/1","55AB8CA6-FEC5-48D1-B3D8-13ED830934CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","68F9AC3F-225C-4FAD-A645-C2F5A9BBB85A"

It comprises a physical exploration of urban manufacturing which we applied in the BS3 and BS4 post code areas in Bristol to find out who is making what, where and how. The method was developed because of the disparities we perceived between the aggregate and out of date data in official statistics which was unable to provide an accurate or detailed characterization of manufacturing activity within this area of Bristol. The novel approach was inspired by the Open Source Mapping movement, and was delivred under the Redistributed Manufacturing in a Resilient, Sustainable City (RDM | RSC) project.

This project has been funded by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 programme. The dataset is a collection of information related to existing industrial symbiosis cases. Data have been gathered from publicly available sources (scientific papers, presentations, white papers, etc.), which are referenced in the dataset, and organised into different categories in order to make information more readable and easily accessible. The dataset is composed of two different and connected sections: a library of case studies and an exchanges database. The library of case studies describes each case according to a precise structure: a brief narrative of the case description is followed by five sections presenting related tacit knowledge content, such as triggering factors, preconditions and barriers. Each case in the library is identified by a numerical ID. All sources used to create the library content (scientific publications, whitepapers, industrial presentation, etc.) are also identified with a numerical ID. A combination of these two numerical IDs plus an additional sequential number univocally identifies each exchange found in the case studies. This numerical identifier serves as link between the case studies and the exchanges sections of the dataset. The exchanges database describes all the exchanges of resources from the cases included in the library of case studies. The information is categorised in two main sections, one related to companies involved and the other to materials exchanged. For each exchange, the industrial sector of the companies involved is identified using the NACE code, while the exchanged material is identified using the European Waste Classification, the European Classification of Products by Activities, and a CAS Registry Number &reg; in case its chemical composition is given. A description of the waste treatment is given wherever applicable, as well as some additional details regarding the synergy (final use of the exchanged flow, availability of flows' quantities and payment details in the original source, level of completion of the exchange). A more detailed description of the library and the database can be found in MAESTRI Deliverable D4.2, accessible here: https://maestri-spire.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/D4.2_MAESTRI-Prototype-library-of-case-studies_v1.0.pdf. An online version of the library and database is accessible from MAESTRI website, the Symbiosis Space: https://maestri-spire.eu/symbiosis-space/. This Space contains descriptions of each case and a downloadable spreadsheet with the data regarding the exchanges. The spreadsheet has VBA&reg; macros to enable facilitated data queries.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2016","Not known","https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/267849","5aa8f8343db881.94654220","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5aa8f8343db881.94654220&grantRef=EP%2FI033351%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/I033351/1","55AB8CA6-FEC5-48D1-B3D8-13ED830934CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","68F9AC3F-225C-4FAD-A645-C2F5A9BBB85A"

"EPSRC","EP/T01962X/1","Research Grant","Research Tools and Methods","Aston University","College of Engineering and Physical Sci","Rahman","Mujib","","Road surface water erosion","Water can damage asphalt roads in several possible mechanisms. Water ingress into surface cracks reduces the bearing capacity of roads. Water diffusion in the mastic phase of asphalt reduces its stiffness and strength. Water infiltration into the film between bitumen/mastic and aggregates cause detachment of aggregate stones from asphalt and reduce its stiffness and strength. Water freeze and thaw is another mechanism of damaging asphalt by water. Water jet on road surfaces, which result from the moving vehicles on soaked roads, could be another mechanism of damaging the roads by water.

Road surfaces are subjected to water jets with different speeds. The water jet results from traffic pressure and movement on roads flooded with water. The mechanism of this process is when a vehicle drives over a flooded section of the road, the water at the tyre edge will be subjected to lateral forces that push the water away from the tyre. If this pulse of water is fast enough, it could lead to loosening and eventually detaching aggregate particles from the road surface. Preliminary analysis has been conducted in this study and showed that this speed could reach 25-30m/sec, which is a very fast water jet. To understand the effect of this water jet and whether it can damage the pavement surface or not, it was necessary to develop an experimental setup capable of simulating that. 

To this end, 3D printing technology was used to build the element. This element was designed to accommodate an asphalt beam of surface dimensions of 30x150mm with depth variable between 30-60mm, and it is called the &quot;flow channel&quot;. The four sides of the specimen are sealed leaving its surface subjected to the water flow. To connect the element to a water source, the testing rig shown in the Figure was designed is currently being manufactured at Aston University. The rig consists of a 200 litre water tank to provide water, a water pump capable of pumping water at high flow rates up to 460 m3/minute, 10 &micro;m filters to catch any eroded materials, and 50mm PVC pipes to connect system components. The flow rate of the pump, the diameter of the pipes, and the cross-sectional area of the flow channel which is the cross-sectional area of the water slice over the testing specimen are optimised according to the Darcy-Weisbach equation. By controlling the flow rate of the pump, this system can provide a water jet speed between 4-26 m/sec which simulates the water jet expected on roads. As stated earlier, this system is currently being manufactured at Aston University and will be used to assess the performance of typical asphalt mixtures used for road surfacing in the UK. 

To capture any possible damage, different methods are currently considered. The first one is by monitoring the loss in the weight of the sample, this way can give the rate of erosion expressed by the reduction in the specimen weight as a function of time. The second one is by using image processing principles; a camera will be fixed over the cover of the flow channel, which is transparent, the camera will take a photo every certain amount of time, which will allow for capturing real-time damaged data. The third one is by using performance indicators such as modulus of rupture or stiffness before and after subjecting asphalt specimens to varying times of water erosion.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2021","This testing method can be used as a performance assessment tool for materials used in road surfacings. Several asphalt types with different binder grades, binder contents, aggregate gradations, and additives are currently used in the construction of road surface layers. If this method is proven to be sensitive to these characteristics and can rank different asphalt mixes based on their resistance to water erosion, then it can serve as a critical design tool against this kind of road surface failure. Furthermore, this method can have further impacts on the sustainability and management of roads in general. For instance, improving the design of asphalt against water erosion can delay the distress resulting from this phenomenon such as ravelling and potholes. This means that the service life of roads will probably be longer, the maintenance cost of roads will be less, fewer maintenance activities will be required, and accordingly, less energy consumption and CO2 emissions, which enhances the sustainability of the asphalt industry.",,"6228c8b83cd665.93598659","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=6228c8b83cd665.93598659&grantRef=EP%2FT01962X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/T01962X/1","9072BA96-0B65-4C12-B185-7BE3CC0A561F","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","5BFB9036-9D16-4AB9-A9EF-097BB6FBD69A","44A7F16D-3B77-4BED-9F0A-3610A800675A"

Between June and September 2019, these modules deepened four lines of interest of the Diploma involving activities and fieldwork within the territories. The modules were: 1) Biodiversity Conservation and Management, 2) Geographic Information Systems (GIS), 3) Agricultural Productive Planning, and 4) Communication.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2019","This method has proven to be innovative and useful to researching how communities in the Cauca region understand, engage with and challenge the Peace Agreement, as well as a tool that is contributing to peacebuilding by joining together social groups who previously were opponents, and generating new knowledge, tools and spaces to strengthen their engagement in territorial planning.

90% of the participants indicated that their perceptions of other ethnic groups improved during the Diploma. 89% specified that the activities and methodologies of the Diploma promoted positive interethnic relationships. 85% reported that they gained new tools for engaging in territorial management, while 95% reported that they acquired new strategies for supporting women's participation in territorial peacebuilding processes. 

Participants also reported that one of the most valued experiences within the Diploma were: &quot;Share with my classmates&quot;, &quot;Living together and sharing experiences with different partners&quot;, &quot;Integration with peasants, indigenous, afro and reincorporated sectors&quot;,&quot;To be able to establish interpersonal relationships with different ethnicities and cultures &quot;,&quot; The exchange of multi-ethnic knowledge for the construction of peace&quot;, &quot;The integration of communities &quot;,&quot;The union and articulation&quot;, &quot;Integration and reconciliation.&quot;

Overall, the assessment of the Diploma suggests that this participatory co-learning research method was very useful for facing and coping with the complexities and difficulties that arise in the context of the post-conflict. The main tools acquired during the Diploma contribute to the construction of peace from local intercultural decolonial perspectives. This method contributed to strengthening inter-ethnic and inter-cultural relationships, as participants recognized the formation of new collaborative inter-territorial relationships. The method also became a tool for building trust, empathy and unity among organizations and communities of the same social group. The strengthening of women's participation was widely valued by both men and women participating in the Diploma. In terms of co-learning processes, participants recognized the importance of experiential activities, social innovation tools, artwork, field trips and the presence of Colombian and UK universities in the territory.",,"5e5f96d5ca8239.98784701","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e5f96d5ca8239.98784701&grantRef=ES%2FR010749%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/R010749/1","317DC152-2EBF-44B3-981C-2F4385CEFB17","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","CAA9A40D-0226-4A4F-AC0D-D8299E30A1EF","38DDF45E-F297-4B73-B0E9-5BB2CE43840C"

The Centenary of the First World War has seen a 'digital big bang': the creation of a huge number of digital collections, resources, and publications, much of it created by community projects. This guide has been developed to advise the creators of these projects on the long term digital preservation and sustainability of these items, to make sure there will be a 'digital legacy' of the Centenary. This is something we are concerned about: we don't just want to preserve the financial investment in creating these digital resources, but the effort that went into them should be respected, and their value for future scholarship and teaching should be protected.

The guide provides useful brief summary of the principles of sustaining digitised content. It is provided as an Annex to a report on preserving outputs produced as part of your project, that have academic and historic significance, including digitised content, administrative content, as well as digital publishing platforms.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","Unknown as yet.","http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/190714/1/190714.pdf","5e6b6a581d2f34.18428835","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e6b6a581d2f34.18428835&grantRef=AH%2FP006671%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/P006671/1","668C45F8-D436-438B-86BF-C8E0E994F6E0","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","EC23DA53-CA73-4104-A3F6-2A9523484E69","80D55749-84B1-4654-B14A-9EB5291195A2"

This collaboration is strengthened by the fact that both programmes have common partners such as Christian Aid (CA) and the National Agency of Meteorology of Burkina Faso (ANAM).

On one hand, BRACED intervenes to Building the Resilience and Adaption of communities to Climate Extremes and Disasters; on the other hand BRAVE intervenes to Bridging science-practice-policy to build livelihoods resilient to drought

These two approaches present many common points of interest which have instigated a joint action supported both by the scientific and technical expertise of the BRAVE project, as well as by the operational aspect and research interest in building resilient communities through the BRACED program. The purpose is to provide the knowledge and capacities needed by rural communities to efficiently manage groundwater resources as part of building their resilience. More specifically, it will examine the vulnerability of communities in relation to the seasonal nature of the use and availability of groundwater resources in order to provide advice in the management of this resource, making use of the newly developed vulnerability indices and the RAINWATCH platform in Burkina Faso.

The new BRAVE-BRACED collaboration was formalised in May 2017 and has taken two main forms:
- Exchange knowledge through sharing tools, the BRAVE vulnerability indices, approaches and documents, as well as joint participation in the respective trainings and workshops organized by the two projects.
- Piloting the operational research in 2 communities in BRACED and two communities in the BRAVE project.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","Yes","2019","The expected result is to develop a practical and non-scientific tool for advisory support to the rural communities and actors working directly with them for the efficient management of groundwater resources for agricultural production contributing to the strengthening of their resilience building.

2. Increasing the impact and usefulness of citizen science collection, through the addition of data sources from INaturalist and Picasa (Google images), as well as the existing services from Flickr.
3. Increasing the effectiveness, access and usefulness of social media for conservation and species observations, by using iNaturalist, Picasa and Flickr for species observations
4. Our web analytics suggests we regularly have 100's of users with several thousand page views and most are returning visitors. The majority if users are from UK, Brazil, Hong Kong and USA.
5. GeoCAT has now been cited 53 times in the scientific literature and assuming more than one assessment is carried per publication indicates well over 100 assessments using GeoCAT to calculate range based metrics for Red Listing.

This innovative sample collection method combined with enhanced surveillance has been expanded in Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal Natal, with elements rolled out nationally in South Africa and Eswatini. In addition the pooled analysis of RDT negative samples has proved to be both cost-effective and time efficient, and therefore has become our standard operating procedure for analysing RDT negative samples as part of smart surveillance.

We have completed our cost-effectiveness assessment of a new malaria species differentiation qualitative PCR assay. While the assay proved to be sensitive, implementing it as routine assay is currently not possible due to the high cost of the specialised kits. The possibility of using these kits will be re-visited should the price drop substantially.
The option of establishing a MassArray system to facilitate rapid generation and curation of data was also explored. Unfortunately, it is not a cost effective option at this stage due to the lack of essential infrastructure, specialised equipment and human resources at the NICD. It was hoped that funding to cover the equipment and human resources
costs would be leveraged from other funders. However, these funding applications have not been successful to date.

While the MassARRAY option has been put on hold, the development of a parasite genotyping screening assay using a targeted amplicon sequencing platform in collaboration with colleagues from the Universities of Pretoria and California-San Francisco is progressing well. Samples from South Africa have been analysed at the University of California-San Francisco using an amplicon panel that establishes relatedness of parasites as well as assesses the prevalence of drug resistance markers. The panel is currently undergoing optimization at the University of California-San Francisco and once optimized for low transmission setting, the amplicon sequencing platform will be trialled at the NICD. If successful, the rapid genotyping of parasites for both population genetic and resistance marker studies will be possible in a single assay. This type of genotyping tool is off great interest to the SADC region, as it is hypothesised that the fine scale differentiation of parasite origin will help accelerate the SADC region towards malaria elimination by identifying areas where control/elimination interventions should be targeted. Given the potential impact of having this technology readily available in the region, the NICD and University of California-San Francisco are involved in preliminary discussion with potential funders to establish a regional genotyping Hub at the NICD.

By working with the malaria programme, we identified and co-developed some training manuals that would empower malaria case investigators to achieve better data collection including geolocating malaria cases at an accuracy of &lt;15m radius. This was complemented by training focused on sharing basic knowledge for getting a correct location, useful field skills on ways to utilise landmarks and important identifiers for telling location, GPS device setting configurations and mobile phone applications usage. Finally plotting these coordinates in Google Maps for visualising the coordinates as an empowerment exercise, quality assurance and for evaluating the training goals. The following draft tools have been shared with provincial malaria programmes and disseminated through the WWARN tools and resources portal: WWARN SS4ME_GPS training manual for trainers__Draft08Nov2019; WWARN SS4ME_SOP GPS essentials installation and data collection guide_ver1.2_Draft08Nov2019 and WWARN SS4ME_SOP GPS location eTrex10 data collection_ver 1.2_Draft08Nov2019. Currently we are also working on opening a GitHub open-source platform to share the coding and processes for curating GPS data to solve some formatting and transcription errors identified by malaria programme data managers.

Enhanced antimalarial resistance surveillance activities were conducted on the 4787 malaria cases notified in Nkomazi sub-district, Mpumalanga from March 2018 to March 2020. The majority of the identified malaria cases (91.3%) were classified as imported malaria cases with 5.3 % classified as local, 0.1 % locally imported and 1.4 % unclassified. The low proportion of locally transmitted cases reflects the significant progress made towards malaria elimination in this area. The stakeholders consulted were strongly supportive of this SS4ME initiative as a feasible method for monitoring for antimalarial drug resistance in areas where there are too few/very dispersed malaria cases for conducting traditional therapeutic efficacy studies and/or too many highly mobile populations for conducting individual therapeutic efficacy studies. SS4ME findings can then be used to identify where to concentrate more intense surveillance and interventions if needed.
 
An optimized PCR platform was established for the high throughput screening of malaria DNA from RDTs. Over 500 additional patient samples from Nkomazi sub-district were assayed in 2019/20 compared to 2018/19. In addition, the establishment of a next generation sequencing facility at the NICD has created the possibility of using a targeted amplicon sequencing platform for the rapid screening for not only molecular markers of antimalarial resistance, but also parasite relatedness which is of particular value for targeting regional elimination activities.
 
SS4ME understanding and appreciation appears to be enhanced when stakeholders were exposed to draft malaria spatial distribution maps of malaria cases, mostly infected with lumefantrine-tolerant malaria parasites that were fortunately all wildtype (&quot;sensitive&quot;) at the 27 Kelch13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with artemisinin resistance. Maps showing the distribution of missing samples by health facility were helpful for effective targeting of refresher training. Similarly, being able to visualize the impact poor quality coordinates had on the malaria maps developed proved very instructive. A marked improvement in the coverage and quality of the GPS coordinates of the household/locality and linking barcode was observed during the duration of this project, with the positive impact of on-site training events clearly demonstrated. All levels of Malaria Elimination Programme staff felt these distribution maps would be useful for the planning of malaria control activities and improving their case investigations. It was generally felt that the SS4ME programme could be sustained/incorporated into routine activities, provided NICD assay costs were funded centrally. The wider utility of this approach has been demonstrated by its adoption by the KwaZulu-Natal Malaria Elimination Programme, and the Eswatini Malaria Programme considering its implementation.
 
Through partnership with the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance network (WWARN), some of tools developed in the SS4ME initiative have been added to the WWARN toolkit (e.g. https://www.wwarn.org/tools-resources/training-materials-obtaining-accurate-malaria-case-gps-coordinates). Furthermore, WWARN will assist in the development and dissemination of additional online tools being developed to address the antimalarial resistance surveillance priorities identified by the national and provincial malaria elimination programmes that participated in the SS4ME initiative. Resources and train-the-trainer materials have also been shared with the Roll Back Malaria Case Management Working Group for consideration for inclusion in their resources database.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","Improved methods for collecting and recording antimalarial resistance data associated with the smart surveillance for malaria elimination project included:
- DNA yield from routine malaria rapid diagnostic tests has increased to over 70% (compared with 40% reported historically)
- Samples now routinely assayed for all 25 polymorphisms confirmed or suspected to be associated with artemisinin resistance / delayed parasite clearance in South-East Asia by 2018, and increased to 27 with thee 2 new polymorphisms identified (G625R and N672S) in 2019; fortunately to date none of the samples assayed were found to have any markers associated with artemisinin resistance. 
- Near real-time linkage of data on molecular markers of antimalarial resistance with individual malaria case notification data will enable prompt effective targeting of investigation and containment efforts should any artemisinin (or partner drug) resistance be identified. This work has been strengthened by comparisons with molecular marker data available since 2001.
- Before and after implementing the above listed training &amp; tools, coverage of malaria case investigations with household GPS coordinates has increased from 59% to 85% and their accuracy has increased from 82% to 98%. 
- These methods have proven to be feasible and sustainable within the normal context of routine malaria surveillance, and their generalisability is now being tested in neighbouring provinces / countries.","https://www.wwarn.org/tools-resources/training-materials-obtaining-accurate-malaria-case-gps-coordinates","5aa901a0a7a339.37027354","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5aa901a0a7a339.37027354&grantRef=MC_PC_16094","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MC_PC_16094","45E33529-6E95-41A6-AAC5-673F638B1873","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","36A3E984-4BE7-48C1-A75D-6EF42DC04AD2"

To gather local stakeholder expertise on which crops and activities would be impacted by flooding during each month of the year, we developed a flood impact matrix. The matrix lists the key crops, livestock and employment activities from an area against the months of the year. Agriculture extension officers were then asked to fill out the matrix by putting a cross in the box corresponding to a month when each crop/activity would be impacted if there was a flood. The boxes which are marked with a cross can then be colour coded to indicate whether this is a positive or negative impact. For example, brick making from clay may be positively impacted by floods, whereas sweet potato crops may be negatively impacted. This matrix provides a link between flood forecasts and the impacts such a flood would have on livelihoods, enabling an impact-based assessment of flood risk and more targeted disaster response planning.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","No","2020","This research tool has been used to collect assessment from 5 district officers who particpated in the NIMFRU project in Katakwi.",,"6023dfd2b10d34.89262259","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=6023dfd2b10d34.89262259&grantRef=NE%2FS00596X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/S00596X/1","9BEC2632-EA08-4421-A007-53B11ACEE9CE","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","E89C3602-0FB4-4044-A918-58966B8A10B2","8052BB87-7123-4292-9517-F284DD425B3E"

The Research and Pathways to Impact Delivery (RAPID) process was carried out to identify areas of research that will form the Centre's core projects. Potential research impacts were considered with reference to the RCUK Pathways to Impact. The Research Councils have grouped impacts into two strands, academic and economic and societal, and these strands provided a general guide for UKCCSRC work on CCS research impact.

The RAPID Process
The RAPID process began with Phase 1, which captured research impacts through UKCCSRC engagement with a wide range of CCS stakeholders. The UKCCSC Biannual Meeting, on 2-3 April 2012, in London fully launched this engagement strategy. This and subsequent meetings, led by the UKCCSRC Research Area Champions, provided well-considered content for Application Impact Tables, which link research areas to levels of knowledge in these areas and to impacts. The research areas and impacts were mapped against the APGTF Report Research and Development priorities (the report is key to the DECC Roadmap for CCS). The results of this community scoping exercise have been compiled and made sense of through production of the first version of the RAPID Handbook, which was launched on 24th July 2012. The RAPID handbook serves to provide the Centre with research requirements for core research activities to be undertaken. 

Revising/Updating RAPID
A series of meetings were held in November 2013 to discuss further RAPID phases, inviting Centre Members to participate in a series of RAPID meetings to review and update the RAPID handbook in light of the forthcoming update to the APGTF Roadmap for CCS. These inputs were included in the RAPID 1.1 Handbook.

Following two stages of development for RAPID with predominantly academic inputs, links have been established with the Centre's Independent Advisory Panel (IAP) and the Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA) Technical Working Group for more targeted CCS practitioner engagement to set priorities and routes for impact.

Real progress in understanding actual CCS deployment issues and the underpinning research required to address them can, however, only be made with the cooperation of the limited number of stakeholders with actual experience of planning and, as time goes on, also executing projects. Progress is therefore related to the rate of CCS market development and the field has seen a significant number of companies leaving since the UKCCSRC project started as well as others joining.

Topical updates, based on links with practitioners, will therefore be undertaken as opportunities allow.

RAPID Phase 2
Just before the UKCCSRC Cranfield Biannual meeting in April 2015 industry representatives from three of the leading post-combustion CCS projects, Peterhead (SSE/Shell), Boundary Dam 3 (SaskPower) and Maasvlakte (EON), met with the IAP and IEAGHG Programme Chair, John Gale, and UKCCSRC academic experts for what is to believed to be a world-first structured workshop on how research activities directed at Phase 2/3 projects for post-combustion capture using amines might be prioritised (i.e. on cost reductions and other criteria). This was intentionally a very well-defined application and one for which the necessary practitioner experience is available. It is also expected (based on subsequently-published ETI analysis) to be a capture application that would be a part of any significant future CCS roll-out to help achieve UK electricity sector decarbonisation by around 2030. Full information on the two-day workshop can be seen at https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/rapid-phase-2.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2012","The RAPID process is on-going and Application Impact Tables will be further refined through specialist meetings led by Research Area Champions, to provide greater granularity.

The Art Crit is a model of learning whereby artists present their work to a group in order to gain feedback on how that work is being 'read' and ways that they might develop it further. The work 'crit' is a shortened version of the word critique (not criticism) and is a process in which people discuss ideas stimulated by an art object, drawing, painting etc. It is comparable to the 19th Century Salon, in which intellectuals, writers, artist and critics formed informal meetings to discuss the context, content, and rational behind an artwork or artefact together with an analysis of its aesthetic properties and visual intent. The Art Crit has not however been used to explore and investigate cross-disciplinary communications. In this project the Art Crits were used as research tools to explore differences of language, the communication and miss-communication between the scientists and the artists, and to further the understanding of the collaboration processes. Important to the research process was the inclusion of a linguist Dr Paul Thompson from Birmingham University, who's areas of expertise included the changing language of environmental and ecological research.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2017","The interactions started before the ACW funding April 2016 with two introductory days, in Swansea and in the National Botanic Garden of Wales, when the participants came together to share ideas, discuss their wide-ranging research and start the collaboration process. These days included Pecha Kucha presentations and a speed-networking event.
As the partnerships started working together they communicated both in person and through emails/Skype to discuss work in progress. In a more formal manner five online art crits were held, a very familiar method of interaction for the artists but new to the scientists. The first three were in small groups of up to 10 participants via Skype and although very informative for many of the artists and scientists, the technology did provide a barrier.
The most significant question that arose from the science perspective during these online crits, when looking at images for textiles, was &quot;How do people view this as information rather than a beautiful image?&quot; The artist responded that &quot;art provokes responses and ideas rather than telling people the information. Intrigue encourages further investigation, so that viewers think and work at this information. It allows viewers to consider 'visual information' to create questioning, and this combined with the scientific research is especially helpful to visual learners to gain a more enriched experience and deeper understanding of the information holistically.&quot; This question demonstrated that some scientists at that stage still viewed the art as only illustrating the science, to provide a more readily accessible way to provide science data. 
At the final two crits held at the final exhibition (NBGW) during the installation stage the perspectives and beliefs of the scientist had changed. These two days of discussion were excellent, with all participants fully involved. Their enthusiasm for engaging with the artworks exceeded expectations. As an example of this change of perception is the following statement from Duncan Coston, &quot;I have worked on multiple research projects looking into the impact of agricultural techniques on pollination services with scientific researchers from across the UK and Europe. However, this has been the first project where I have collaborated with researchers from the Arts. Although I originally had some misgiving on how the Arts and Sciences would work together, with both disciplines having such different methods and processes, I was immediately put to rights! This project has opened up a whole set of ideas and ways of looking at scientific research. The whole process has been a big eye opener to me and I hope to continue collaborating with the arts and across other disciplines through my career&quot;.","https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/","5aa3fb4234d509.08321033","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5aa3fb4234d509.08321033&grantRef=AH%2FN00597X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/N00597X/1","AF5C5F5A-F5F0-411B-878D-6360246B1BE2","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","7D8346F1-4332-4E10-A513-F2A5B463A923","059EC835-FD25-406D-A849-5BD0D33B0DE7"

The Research and Pathways to Impact Delivery (RAPID) process was carried out to identify areas of research that will form the Centre's core projects. Potential research impacts were considered with reference to the RCUK Pathways to Impact. The Research Councils have grouped impacts into two strands, academic and economic and societal, and these strands provided a general guide for UKCCSRC work on CCS research impact.

The RAPID Process
The RAPID process began with Phase 1, which captured research impacts through UKCCSRC engagement with a wide range of CCS stakeholders. The UKCCSC Biannual Meeting, on 2-3 April 2012, in London fully launched this engagement strategy. This and subsequent meetings, led by the UKCCSRC Research Area Champions, provided well-considered content for Application Impact Tables, which link research areas to levels of knowledge in these areas and to impacts. The research areas and impacts were mapped against the APGTF Report Research and Development priorities (the report is key to the DECC Roadmap for CCS). The results of this community scoping exercise have been compiled and made sense of through production of the first version of the RAPID Handbook, which was launched on 24th July 2012. The RAPID handbook serves to provide the Centre with research requirements for core research activities to be undertaken. 

Revising/Updating RAPID
A series of meetings were held in November 2013 to discuss further RAPID phases, inviting Centre Members to participate in a series of RAPID meetings to review and update the RAPID handbook in light of the forthcoming update to the APGTF Roadmap for CCS. These inputs were included in the RAPID 1.1 Handbook.

Following two stages of development for RAPID with predominantly academic inputs, links have been established with the Centre's Independent Advisory Panel (IAP) and the Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA) Technical Working Group for more targeted CCS practitioner engagement to set priorities and routes for impact.

Real progress in understanding actual CCS deployment issues and the underpinning research required to address them can, however, only be made with the cooperation of the limited number of stakeholders with actual experience of planning and, as time goes on, also executing projects. Progress is therefore related to the rate of CCS market development and the field has seen a significant number of companies leaving since the UKCCSRC project started as well as others joining.

Topical updates, based on links with practitioners, will therefore be undertaken as opportunities allow.

RAPID Phase 2
Just before the UKCCSRC Cranfield Biannual meeting in April 2015 industry representatives from three of the leading post-combustion CCS projects, Peterhead (SSE/Shell), Boundary Dam 3 (SaskPower) and Maasvlakte (EON), met with the IAP and IEAGHG Programme Chair, John Gale, and UKCCSRC academic experts for what is to believed to be a world-first structured workshop on how research activities directed at Phase 2/3 projects for post-combustion capture using amines might be prioritised (i.e. on cost reductions and other criteria). This was intentionally a very well-defined application and one for which the necessary practitioner experience is available. It is also expected (based on subsequently-published ETI analysis) to be a capture application that would be a part of any significant future CCS roll-out to help achieve UK electricity sector decarbonisation by around 2030. Full information on the two-day workshop can be seen at https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/rapid-phase-2.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2012","The RAPID process is on-going and Application Impact Tables will be further refined through specialist meetings led by Research Area Champions, to provide greater granularity.

It was free and open to all, ran across four weeks, and involved a minimum of 5 hours learning activity a week. The description was: 

Why join the course?
There are more slaves alive today than at any point in history. Around the world, nearly 46 million people are forced to work against their will for no pay. Responding to this challenge over the past 20 years, a new antislavery movement has shown us that a world without slavery is possible. Now is your chance to learn about this major human rights issue with the world's first massive open online course about contemporary slavery.

Understand contemporary slavery
You'll learn from experts at the cutting edge of human rights research, and you'll investigate the complex systems that sustain slavery today.

You will consider:

Different forms of slavery

Ground-breaking research about slavery's measurement and definition

Strategies for ending slavery at the local, national and international levels

The roles of governments, businesses, technology, legislation and enslaved people themselves in ending slavery

Explore the historical context of slavery
The new UN Sustainable Development Goals now call for an end to global slavery by 2030, but how can we achieve this? To end slavery in the future, first we must look to the past. On the course we will look at the historical context of slavery and antislavery. What antislavery techniques have worked to date? Do past antislavery movements offer any lessons? Is historical antislavery a usable past for today's efforts?

Learn from experts in the field
This course is supported by the AHRC Care for the Future research grant &quot;The Antislavery Usable Past&quot; and features research and teaching from experts in human rights and in past and present antislavery. It is taught by Professor Kevin Bales, the world's leading expert on contemporary slavery and one of the leaders of the antislavery movement, along with Professor Zoe Trodd, a leading expert on antislavery, and Dr. Katie Donington, a slavery historian.

You will have access to the most cutting-edge research available in this area and be part of brainstorming a new guide for ending slavery that covers every level, from the individual to the United Nations.

On this course you have the chance to not only learn about slavery and antislavery, but also debate and shape solutions for the next phase of the contemporary antislavery movement. This course is an essential experience for anyone who wants to be part of a great human rights battle of our time.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2016","We reached 8000 learners, from at least 150 different countries (from all continents except Antarctica).

In the last step of the MOOC, the learners came up with their own pledges for what they would do next in their lives towards ending slavery locally, nationally and internationally. As it was so popular, we run it again in May 2017 (rather than waiting another year).

Our developed AV fusion approach is cognitively inspired in that it contextually learns and switches between audio and visual cues depending on noisy and environmental conditions.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2020","Our developed AV speech enhancement approach has been widely used and cited by researchers worldwide as a benchmark resource. It was further evaluated as part of a follow-on PhD project (led by the PI). This demonstrated significant performance improvement under white noise at low SNRs, compared to conventional speech enhancement methods (SS and LMMSE). At high SNRs, for the case of uncorrelated White Noise, the LMMSE approach was found to outperform our AV approach (with a mean opinion score (MOS) of approx. 4.5 vs 3). Further performance evaluation in real noisy environments suggested that even at high SNRs, the proposed approach performed comparably to conventional speech enhancement approaches. The aforementioned limitation of our AV approach led us to propose the development of a more optimal, context-aware AV system, that can effectively account for different noisy, environmental conditions.

Consequently, this transporter is expressed constitutively when expressed in cells and can be detected using anti-V5 antibodies. Importantly, the expression of this construct enables manipulation of cell environment (e.g. addition of hormones, changes in nutrient availability etc) to assess how stability of V5-tagged protein is altered independently of gene transcription. 

We have also generated SNAT2-SNAT5 chimeric constructs. The latter contains the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SNAT2 fused to full length SNAT5 that has its N-terminal domain missing. The N-terminal domain of SNAT2 is thought to dictate transporter stability and by fusing it to SNAT5 the construct can be used to show such stability effects can be conferred upon a structurally related transporter that does not exhibit such stabilising properties in response to changes in nutrient availability. 

The unique stabilsing-conferring properties of the N-terminal domain of SNAT2 are thought to reside in one of seven lysine residues that potentially serve as targets for ubiquitin E3-ligase activity. Ubiquitination of one or more of these residues renders SNAT2 unstable and susceptible to degradation by the proteasome system. We have generated a SNAT2-V5 construct in which all 7 Lys residues have been mutated to an alanine. This mutated SNAT2-V5 construct is constitutively stable and so represents a useful tool when assessing stimulus-induced regulation of SNAT2 stability.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","The notion that the SNAT2 amino acid transporter may function as a transceptor in which it senses binding of its own amino acid substrates to regulate its own stability is a novel concept in mammalian transporter physiology. The constructs that we have generated have enabled us to demonstrate that when cells are subjected to nutrient withdrawal they can upregulate the abundance of key nutrient transporters (such as SNAT2) that help scavenge and allow take up of what limited nutrients may exist to sustain cell viability. When cells are subsequently placed in amino acid replete media the abundance of SNAT2 is down-regulated via proteosomal degradation. The constructs that we have generated have enabled us to decipher that the ability to upregulate/downregulate transporter expression in response to nutrient availability is crucially dependent on structural elements within the N-terminal domain whose exposure to molecules regulating transporter degradation is, itself, modified by substrate binding to the carrier. Such insight is now driving research aimed at understanding how interactions between nutrients and their transporters induces conformational changes in the transporter that not only signals carrier occupancy but which potentially recruits ancillary proteins that then either stabilise or target the carrier for degradation. Targeting these latter molecules may offer novel strategies by which nutrient uptake may be reduced to limit cell growth (which is of relevance to cancer biology) or alternatively enhancing nutrient uptake which may help sustain cell/tissue health and function (which may be of relevance, for example, to restrain loss of lean muscle mass, i.e. sarcopenia).",,"58c006d83bfc95.45078331","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c006d83bfc95.45078331&grantRef=BB%2FI007261%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/I007261/1","E5712A4E-BAB6-4565-A966-DFD3410FD2E9","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","90051600-6EF2-4093-BA8C-2B4B6F550895","CA8CA152-BA26-4D70-9495-A7AADF23CC85"

It has been found that not only are inorganic constituents (ash) effectively removed by coupling a physicochemical technology with conventional leaching but also the intermolecular interactions within the lignocellulosic matrix can be modified, as shown by a variable crystallinity index (powder X-ray diffraction) without the loss of physical bonding (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy). Ultimately, this allowed for a greater thermochemical transformation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin for all technologies used: conventional leaching, indirect/directed ultrasound, and microwave irradiation. However, the use of directed ultrasound was found to be the standout, energy efficient technology (8.6 kJ/g) to radically improve the thermochemical transformation of wood waste, especially in the reduction of fixed carbon at high temperatures. It was also found to be efficient at removing vital eutectic mixture causing elements, including Si, which is known to be notoriously difficult to remove via leaching. In comparison, hot plate leaching and microwave irradiation use 39 and 116 times more energy, respectively. The integration of this technology into the energy production sector will prove vital in the future due to its scalability, as compared with microwave alternatives, which are currently not suitable for large scale operations. Additionally, the residence time required for directed ultrasound was found to be negligible as compared to the various other physicochemical techniques, 0.1 h opposed to 4 h.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2020","Application of a technique borrowed from medical science in chemical engineering and biomass derived solid fuels","https://hull-repository.worktribe.com/output/3362801/augmented-leaching-pretreatments-for-forest-wood-waste-and-their-effect-on-ash-composition-and-the-lignocellulosic-network","604a838aa8df34.04123596","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=604a838aa8df34.04123596&grantRef=EP%2FP034667%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/P034667/1","705F190D-AF70-4F01-8FF0-D06609E6EF92","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","8A0FC07A-04CD-4F7A-9095-1D2E6C1D918F","A8069B8C-BA5F-4CEB-9B2F-1A134A555EDE"

For the purposes of this project, we have conducted an interviewer administered, face-to-face household survey of 4,576 adults aged 40 years or above living in Gaza. Randomly selected households have been approached during culturally convenient times of the day using a random multistage, stratified cluster sampling approach to produce representative data of the Gazan population. A survey questionnaire was developed by the research team. Questions in the survey have been taken from commonly used household surveys in the Gaza Strip (e.g. Demographic and Health Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, WHO STEPS, etc). More specifically, the survey has 16 modules including (1) Participant identification; (2) Demographics, (3) Food security (using the Food and Agriculture Organization's food insecurity experience scale (FIES) and Arab Family Food Security Scale (AFFSS)), (4) Assistance (using Expenditure and Consumption Survey, Palestine 2011, UNICEF Cash Transfer Surveys, UNRWA Household Form Socio-economic Survey of Palestine Refugees in Lebanon); (5) Psychosocial Health (using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire); (6-9) History of diabetes mellitus, Raised Blood Pressure, Raised Total Cholesterol Cardiovascular diseases, Chronic Respiratory Diseases and Cancer (using the Non-communicable diseases and behavioral risk factor survey, Lebanon 2009 WHO STEPS, Palestine); (10) Physical Activity (Adopted from International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)); (11) Dietary Salt (using WHO STEPS, Palestine); (12-14) Tobacco Use, Nargila Use and Lifestyle Change (using the Non-communicable diseases and behavioral risk factor survey, Lebanon 2009 and WHO STEPS, Palestine); (15) Physical measurements (blood pressure, waist circumference, and height and weight); (16) Nutrition (using a validated nutritional questionnaire for the Palestine population; Hamdan et al Public Health Nutrition, 17(11), 2512-2518).
The survey has been translated from English language into Arabic. Both English and Arabic versions of the survey will be uploaded onto an online survey program (called KoBoToolbox).

This method is based on linear programming and environmental extended input-output methods to determine optimal water restrictions to economic sectors under a drought event. The new conceptual framework distinguishes between 'green' and 'blue' water - the two primary sources of drought-induced economic impact. Green water describes water stored in the top layer of soil and vegetation, while blue water comprises fresh surface water and groundwater. The economic impact of a green and blue water drought is manifest via different mechanisms. Green water availability is largely determined by environmental conditions, particularly climate. The economic impact of a green water drought is felt foremost by the agricultural sector, particularly those reliant on rainfed production. Economic impacts arising from the initial phase of a drought are usually limited to those sectors reliant on green water. Blue water impacts of drought arise from long-term choices about the water storage, interconnection and production capacity (i.e. hydraulic capital) as well as short-term management decisions regarding the timing, severity and allocation of water restrictions applied to different users.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2016","The new framework provides insights on the drought management policies in the short and long term, and the economic consequences of different actions. By highlighting the trade-offs and choices involved in decision-making, the MaRIUS project hopes this framework will be able to assist policy-makers, regulators, water companies, water users and other stakeholders in managing and responding to drought over the short and long-term.","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800916309351","58b837247ae306.75101013","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58b837247ae306.75101013&grantRef=NE%2FL010364%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/L010364/1","3C6E8C4E-C228-4BF7-ABDE-76F0F56C65DF","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","87375C3E-B225-4673-97F3-11C566ED0D4F"

(EP/J018058/1) by Professor Edward D Boyes (CoI) and Professor Pratibha L Gai (PI), University of York

In chemical technology heterogeneous catalysts consisting of nano-scale particles operate in gas atmospheres and at elevated temperatures. Cutting edge fundamental science is needed to understand and improve performance of the behaviour of these catalysts in controlled reaction environments, to support internationally competitive chemical process industries in the UK. As part of our EPSRC grant EP/ EP/J018058/1 we have developed, for the first time globally, aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC ESTEM) instrumentation. This project has established in the UK the world's first atomic resolution (AC) E(S)TEM capability and we are making it increasingly widely available to colleagues in the UK and in collaborations internationally. The AC ESTEM capabilities include, atomic scale imaging and analysis under controlled conditions of gas environment around the specimen held at high temperature. The new facilities operate under a sub set of realistic reaction conditions with single atom sensitivity. Include are Z-contrast high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM imaging, energy dispersive x-ray chemical analysis and wide angle electron diffraction (including CBDP), as well as electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The project is designed to generate for the first time and in close collaboration with the vibrant UK catalysis and chemicals industry, fundamental and practical atomic scale understanding of key preparative, activation, reaction, deactivation and where practical reactivation processes. Analysis of real world practices show considerable scope for improvement in deploying resources, including the amount of precious metals needed for automotive exhaust emissions controls.

Development of novel AC E(S)TEM :
We have modified an existing AC TEM/STEM instrument to complement and extend its capabilities with gas reaction studies while maintaining, and in some aspects extending the full performance and functionality of the core tool. Our new design provides the world's first full function aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). The global competition (approx. 20 labs, all overseas -including Europe, USA, Japan) continues to use a version of our earlier ETEM design which is in practice high resolution in TEM only and come with a single aberration corrector for TEM imaging. The old design has significant analytical and imaging limitations which make it unsuitable for multi-user environments; to the extent several laboratories have a dedicated machine (as we did with the original) and second instrument for other uses. This is expensive in both capital and operating costs as well as in real estate and support needs. With the modifications to the machine at York, ETEM is also (re-) introduced into the UK in high resolution form. Perhaps more significantly, cost-wise, the full ESTEM functionality also supports full STEM for the parallel high vacuum operations. This in itself is major advantage of the new developments which not only enable the new functionalities but also support a much wider and more intensive utilisation of the capital kit investment in multi-use applications, as well as ensuring the support coats are spread over as wide a range of applications as possible. In association with partners in the vibrant UK chemical and energy industries we are generating fundamental application science underpinning nanoparticle based solid state heterogeneous catalysis used in gas-solid reactions. Our primary industry partners are Johnson Matthey Plc.
With the award of the grant in 2012 we began construction of modifications beyond the very limited proof-of-principle demonstrations for gas operations on the multi-use high resolution microscope in our laboratory at York. 

The year 2013 saw the launch of our aberration corrected ESTEM as a scientifically useful capability. Further improvements to the new core capability and to support other uses of the capital kit, with a minimum of compromises and crucially without the need to change the machine configuration for different applications, are continuing. For example there is a simple and rapid switch over from gas-mode to high vacuum mode.

Phase one technical developments on the microscope have been successfully completed and they have produced a first high profile application publication by E D Boyes and P L Gai et al in Annalen der Physik in June 2013. With the developments we have created a world leading new ESTEM functionality without compromising other attributes for these and other applications on the existing high vacuum multi-user machine. 

Recent progress with the new generation of MEMS hot stages we have been able to purchase with the grant (substituting for part of the originally proposed old technology), has been transformational in what we can do scientifically, in productivity and with most of the technical support by ourselves on site rather than regular sagas of return- to-foreign-factory for service. This development makes it practical to track areas continuously over time and during temperature transits, with especial relevance to comparison data for the MC calculations; themselves not part of the project but augmenting it through studentships.

The science the new capabilities open up is exciting. AC ESTEM provides a key tool for the study of single atoms in catalysts under reaction conditions with the ability to analyse the structure of the nanoparticles. This is a novel and very important development in terms of impact. As well as new information on the migration of materials from one discrete, in this case metal, nanoparticle to another; it shows the importance of these species leading to active sites. This work relates to parallel on-going Monte Carlo (MC) calculations and provides important input for further calculations of functionality and specific chemical reactivity; through for example the density functional theory (DFT) methods we used for catalytic nanoparticles (at that time studied with temperature and without gas) in our 2012 Nanoletters paper (vol. 12, p.2027). In 2014 further technical developments on the microscope have increased the gas pressures inside the microscope (as outlined in our EPSRC grant proposal) and resulted in high profile publications in the first quarter of 2014, including in Comptes Rendu Phys. by E D Boyes and P L Gai (15, p.200, 2014) and MRS Bull. 40, 600 (2015). This has also been the time for ramping up the PDRA supported applications of the new kit developments. 4x PDRAs have now been appointed; all of them experienced electron microscopists with application domain science backgrounds in nanoparticle physics and chemistry for catalysis. In this we have been most fortunate.

Our AC ESTEM development has led to the support for continuing as associate partner of EPSRC SuperSTEM at Daresbury, as the in-situ component of the EPSRC National facility for aberration corrected electron microscopy. Project work with Leeds and Sheffield are ongoing on this. 
There has been significant industrial collaboration leading to joint publications with Johnson Matthey Plc, a FTSE 100 company and world leader in precious metals and catalysis. JM was also a strong supporter of our grant proposal and the interaction continues to be further strengthened at the strategic and tactical levels. The latter include CASE studentships, access to their extensive technical resources for both specimen preparation (including custom preparation to our specifications where needed) and testing, and regular direct technical work for which they pay the University.

The grant holders- Professors Gai and Boyes' track record as world leaders in this field has been recognised by the award of the biannual Institute of Physics Gabor medal and prize in September 2010, Fellowship of the Institute of Physics (EDB); L'Oreal-UNESCO Women in Science award as the 2013 Laureate for Europe (PLG); the Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Engineering (PLG); and the EPSRC sponsored committee membership on the future of advanced electron microscopy in the UK (EDB).

The work has led to the establishment in the UK of the leading centre globally for high resolution dynamic in-situ reaction and other phase transformation studies under controlled conditions of gas atmosphere and temperature. With this project we have introduced the first environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (ESTEM) instrumentation with 0.1nm resolution and single atom sensitivity for dynamic in-situ experiments on heterogeneous catalysts under controlled conditions of gas atmosphere and of high temperatures.

Significant parts of the chemical and energy industries, in which the UK is internationally competitive, depend on heterogeneous catalysis based on active nanoparticles, often of metal, dispersed on a support which is typically carbon or ceramic oxide supports. Small particles in the low nanometre range have size dependent properties; sometimes of character and always of surface area for a given volume. There is always a battle between initial effectiveness, measured in activity and selectivity, and structural and chemical stability; in the process unfortunately but correctly defying the textbook definition of a catalyst as unchanging. 

Electron microscopy is a leading method of studying such materials, and the authors (PI and CoI) of this project have led its adaptation globally for purpose over three decades. The principle development has been to create differentially pumped instrumentation in which dynamic in-situ reaction study experiments can be performed with atomic resolution under controlled conditions of temperature and most importantly of gas atmosphere; replacing the usual, and chemically alien, high vacuum atomic resolution analytical instrument environment. 
These developments allow chemically active species to be created and studied in-situ, rather than optimistically required to be transferred into the analytical system through air without modification. Details of their development or activation, subsequent operation and eventual deactivation, and even reactivation and precious metals recovery, can be followed through dynamic sequences in ESTEM. This allows much more reliable and insightful experiments than would otherwise be possible, and indeed some prior art studies have had to be substantially revised on this basis; for example by clearly separating (and correcting) reaction causes and effects.
 
We have now made further significant advances in the method with a radical new approach to system engineering. Most importantly this allows, we believe for the first time, full integration with a double aberration corrected TEM/STEM instrument at 0.1nm resolution in both modes. This enables the first high performance E(S)TEM (environmental (scanning) transmission electron microscopy) in the world.

A major advance with the new approach has been to enable full use of the atomic resolution and atomic number (Z) contrast high angle annular dark field (HAADF) with single atom sensitivity, which is key to understanding reaction mechanisms. This is not possible with the previous designs being used around the world which are configured primarily for high resolution TEM, rather than STEM imaging. Most such systems used globally are copies of earlier designs of atomic resolution-ETEM pioneered by Boyes and Gai; most cogently described in references [E D Boyes and P L Gai, Ultramicroscopy, 92, 67 (1997); P L Gai, E D Boyes, et al. MRS Bulletin 32(no.12): 1044 (2007) and P L Gai et al Science, 67, p.661]. We are therefore well aware of the strengths - and weaknesses - of these systems in which global investment now amounts to many 10s of millions of &pound;, including in continental Europe, Japan and the US. To date there have been no high performance ETEMs in the UK where the situation is a regression from where the authors left it in the late 1980s. Since then the steady expansion and recent explosion in ETEM activities has been exclusively overseas. An incidental impact, but one of some considerable significance, is likely to be a cohort of younger researchers exposed to the 'can-do' spirit that it is very desirable, and indeed doable, to reconfigure even sophisticated apparatus for specific significant purpose, and in the process gain a personal and institutional competitive advantage. As in the current project, this approach, done right, can substantially extend the productive life of core capital kit by adapting it for specific purpose. All useful learnings from the project.

With the new configuration, parallel high performance chemical analysis by energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDX) is also made possible for the first time in an E(S)TEM. This is additionally important since the modus operandi, in part for reliability and in part to optimise capital investment in multiple application domain sciences, is to leave the E(S)TEM components permanently mounted in the column and to operate interchangeably with and without a gas environment for experiments with different needs. EDX is an important complement to any high resolution STEM study and its inclusion on the new machine is therefore especially important; in addition to introducing its direct use in chemical experiments including dynamic in-situ catalysis studies. The restriction on gas pressures to &lt;0.1 torr this entails is still well within the 'high' pressure (&gt;0.001 torr) region of surface studies, as defined in the literature [PCCP 9, 3500-3513, (2007)], although of course much less than used in some commercial reactors. The connection is through the science. 
The new activities are becoming a magnet for broad scientific interest to generate an impressive showpiece for British science both through its output and its physical presence.

In addition to our novel instrumental development, this project is focused on new methods of fundamental science applied to technology applications in collaboration with leading UK companies, whose expertise, interests and needs are contributing significantly to the planning, implementation, development and exploitation of the novel AC E(S)TEM development. 
Other areas of impact of this project include:
• training of a cohort of students, PDRAs, visiting scientists and academic colleagues
• the establishment in the UK the global centre of excellence in this aspect of in-situ catalysis science and of the experimental methods on which it is based
• the extension of the science base on the structure and stability of the smaller sizes, generally &lt;10nm, of nanoparticles on various supports of practical significance
• the AC E(S)TEM development is playing a key role in understanding atomic reaction mechanisms in the following York programmes in collaboration with the UK chemical industry. Examples include: (a) AC ESTEM imaging of single atoms under controlled temperature and gas environment conditions in catalyst reaction studies. (Ann.Phys. (Berlin) 525, 423 (2013). and Chemical Physics Letters (592, 355, 2014); (b) Understanding atomic scale interactions in electrode catalysts for fuel cells in reduction and oxidation environments using AC E(S)TEM: (c) Visualisation and analysis of single atom dynamics in water gas shift (WGS) reaction (CO+H2O? CO2+H2) for hydrogen generation important to fuel cells using AC E(S)TEM. Here the in-situ atomic resolution observations on practical gold/ceria catalysts have revealed the formation of clusters of a few gold atoms from single atom dynamics under controlled WGS environments at operating temperatures influencing the WGS catalysis(Catal Sc. Tech.2015; DOI: 10.1039/c5cy01154j; in collaboration with Johnson Matthey).

FunVar has been designed to facilitate analysis of population/pathogenic variants in human proteins or pathogen/host genes. Variants (specifically non-synonymous polymorphisms i.e. residue mutations) are mapped to protein structures, where available, to allow assessment of their proximity to functional sites and therefore possible impact on protein function. Variant data is obtained from publicly available sources. We hope that visualisation of these mutations on the protein structure, illustrating their proximity to functional sites can help guide diagnostics and therapeutics. Future editions of these pages will add quantitative data suggesting the likelihood of functional impact.

Currently, CATH FunVar provides two use cases:

 annotations for proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its human host interactor proteins i.e. human proteins interacting with viral proteins
 human proteins with mutations implicated in cancer, taken from TCGA.

In the future, the data on other important pathogenic infections such as tuberculosis will also be made available at CATH FunVar.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2020","The FunVar web resource allows the wider scientific community to explore the location of mutations (currently from Sars-CoV-2 and cancer datasets) on protein structural domains in CATH.

This omission is particularly anomalous in the context of climate change. We extend the literature in four ways. First, we argue that competition for land between ?rms and households will generate an endogenous role for house prices, which we estimate using a generalised method of moments two-stage least squares spatial econometric model. Second, we model interaction effects between agglomeration and ?ood-risk using a gravity-based agglomeration measure. Third, we utilise a high-resolution ?ood-risk measure which incorporates both ?ood frequency and
severity. Fourth, we use a high-resolution measure of employment to capture local effects. We ?nd that agglomeration economies have a signi?cant mitigating effect on ?ood-risk. This is potentially important because it suggests that ?oodrisk may have a more deleterious effect on employment in areas where economic agglomeration is weak. Policy-makers, insurers and planners cannot, therefore, assume a uniform effect of future changes to ?ood-risk as a result of climate change, and this needs to be taken into account when estimating the costs and bene?ts of interventions to reduce or underwrite ?ood-risk at particular locations.

Once cells form a monolayer covering the collagen and the capillaries, the scaffold is removed with collagenase, leaving the monolayer suspended between the test rods. The suspended monolayers are subjected to stretching by prying the capillaries apart with a micromanipulator. The applied force can be measured for the characterization of monolayer mechanics.

This means that researchers are not involved in the linkage process and do not see potentially identifying information. However, in this project we required to link high dimension environmental data (spatially and temporally resolved UV data) numbering many hundreds of millions of records. Without knowing which postcodes existed in the health data and therefore which environmental records needed to be supplied we were required to provide the entire environmental database for linkage. This was challenging due to its size and the time and computing resources needed to link a database of this size this to the health data. Following discussion with the electronic Data Research and Innovation Service (eDRIS) at the NHS we developed a number of changes to the existing system for such linkages. Now, such datasets will be held permanently by eDRIS as part of their standard data holding. This will also make the data more readily available for wider research projects in a format that simplifies the linkage process.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2019","The main impact of this aspect of the research has been to simplify the process by which large dimension environmental data can be linked to sensitive NHS health data.",,"5c891319a10d81.86276469","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c891319a10d81.86276469&grantRef=NE%2FP010911%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/P010911/1","7D4B34F9-7E84-498C-A5BB-B6A97ED4D21E","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","6DAF646F-25E4-45BA-9F25-7FD0D78C1558"

This workshop will describe how to apply Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) as described in Brunsdon et al (1996) and Fotheringham et al (2002) to spatial data, using R and RStudio, the free open source statistical software. It will use the sub-catchment soils data for the Liudaogou watershed, as described in Wang et al (2009). 

The workshop aims are to get you using R / RStudio and this document describes the preparations you need to make before coming to the workshop. For the workshop you will need:
1) A computer with R and RStudio installed: R can be downloaded from here: https://cran.r-project.org and then you should download RStudio from here https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/. RStudio has R as its engine and has a nicer interface than R
2) To have gone through and run the code in the Owen guide (up to page 28) https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Owen-TheRGuide.pdf 
3) You will need to have an internet connection - this is really important!
4) If you can, please bring your own data to explore using GWR. This should be a spatial dataset of some kind: a CSV or EXCEL file with latitude and longitude or a shapefile from ArcGIS are probably the most common formats. We can provide data if you do not have any.

Animal-borne tags captured GPS snapshots whenever the seals surfaced. These were processed using the Fastloc algorithm and retransmitted by UHF telemetry (869.4-869.65MHz) when the seal next surfaced. Data were also stored in the tags and downloaded when animals hauled out within line of sight of a terrestrial base-station. 
The receiving system comprised a cluster of four base stations with directional antennas at 90o to each other. Accurate GPS locations were decoded in real time from most transmission, but for undecipherable signals the relative signal strengths from the four antennas provided an approximate bearing. 
GPS locations of seals within range and the vessel's current position were viewed in near real time using Google Earth. Static maps covering the study site were preloaded and cached on a laptop. A Zend Framework PHP application, converted the most recent seal and vessel locations into dynamic KML files that were then streamed to a Google-Earth 3D display. 
The combination of two way communications between the tags and the base stations and multiple methods for retrieving data from bases stations and tags resulted in a system that was flexible and adaptable.","Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo","","","Yes","2015","The system was deployed in 2013 and 2014 to track 23 harbour seals.

The tool enables assessment of three levels of physical activity intensity (Sedentary, Walking, Vigorous) and two other evidence-based behavioural indicators of wellbeing (Connect: connecting with others, and Take Notice: taking notice of the environment). It has been developed to help with 'before and after' assessment of interventions (also called natural experiment studies). As well providing a systematic way of recording behaviour change, MOHAWk also assesses people's characteristics, including age, gender and ethnicity. Importantly, the approach developed by the project team involves the identification of a number of matched comparison sites. The comparison sites are used to help identify whether changes at the intervention site are statistically different to those seen in other similar neighbourhood settings, i.e. without an intervention.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","Yes","2019","Better understanding and quantification of impacts from interventions.

This was done through literature review of existing methods, and through discussion with several pastoralists and small ruminant experts in Kenya. This tool allowed collecting the information needed on under 40 minutes, and without the need of expensive and laborious longitudinal studies. The tool was piloted with five pastoralists. Subsequently, a survey of 130 small ruminant pastoralists in Kajiado was conducted between June and September 2019, and we collected data flock performance using the tool. We have been successful in capturing and analyzing these data, since the results obtained were similar to existing literature estimates. This validates the effectiveness of our tool. Furthermore the analysis included the development of a novel indicator that could be useful to assess the combined efficiency of both species for these farmers. A manuscript has currently been drafted and is being reviewed internally.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","No","2019","Currently, without reliable and up-to-date data, detection and management of pastoralists' production inefficiencies and resources is difficult, and often requires the use of subjective views from point sources. This lack of data acts as a barrier for pastoralists to improve their production and to manage their resources efficiently; and for government services to provide advice and to effectively and timely implement and monitor interventions or policies. Furthermore, major impact on reproduction performance indicators generate risks on the ability of pastoralists to maintain their flock size, threatening their food security and livelihood. Our methodology enables to capture data about flock performance of small ruminant pastoralists. The methodology used was found easy to implemented and acceptable by pastoralists, with very low levels of rejections, and the results obtained on performance were in similar range to other methodologies.
The tool proposed in this study can be used to: (1) allow to identify those pastoralists with lower productivity and target resources towards these so that industry efficiency can be improved; (2) identify those herds that have a very good flock performance, which can be used as reference points for the industry; (3) implement programs to obtain benchmarking data on pastoralists over time which will allow comparison and development of targets; (4) use by policy and private stakeholders to measure the effectiveness of their policies or interventions; and (5) generate a baseline data and indicator for future research and economic studies needed to assess the viability of pastoralists systems.",,"5e5b93fedc8b14.21388850","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e5b93fedc8b14.21388850&grantRef=BB%2FS004866%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/S004866/1","5CAD54DC-66A5-4CDE-A242-4035A795E016","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","1AB05DA1-4DD6-4843-B416-D7D9441EBFFB","0D12BB29-2A34-419A-9DC8-0BB296BBFE69"

The on/off status of each unit and the determined to minimize the generation cost. Though a number of methods have been proposed to optimize the UC problem, it remains intractable to balance due the computational time and the result refinement. The UC problem becomes even more challenging when a large number of EVs are integrated into the system. In addition to traditional thermal units and predicted loads, the aggregation of a large number of PEVs would act as
both a large load when being charged and a distributed generator unit when being discharged. Some studies consequently introduced PEVs into the UC optimization procedure to evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of PEV charging and discharging within the conventional UC problem. Different PEV charging and discharging scenarios have shown significant impact on the cost, yet very
few publications have comparatively evaluated the difference of PEVs charging and discharging strategies within the UC problem. In this paper, multiple PEVs scenarios including four different charging-only scenarios, two different discharging only scenarios, two charging and discharging combination scenarios, as well as PEV s charging and discharging combined with renewable energy sources are comparatively studied in the UC problem, which is now called as the PEVUC problem. In this analysis the binary on/off problem in UC is solved using a quantum inspired binary PSO.

Quantum inspired and hybrid typology binary particle swarm optimization and other binary optimization methods are employed to determine the binary status of each unit. Four scenarios of wind generation over multiple seasons, one scenario of photovoltaic generation and four scenarios of plug-in electric vehicles charging loads are comparatively studied. The numerical results show that the new algorithm significantly overcomes the drawback of the original binary particle swarm optimization and is competitive in terms of solving the unit commitment problem. By utilizing these new tools, the contribution of economic cost and cost/saving rates are analyzed in multiple scenarios of unit commitment with the integration of renewable energy generation and plug-in electric vehicles charging.

A 10-unit UC problem is assessed, combining multiple PEV charging and discharging scenarios including charging only mode, discharging-only mode, charging and discharging mode, and charging and discharging combined with renewable energy generation mode. Different PEV scenarios are comparatively studied and the UC problem is solved using a quantum-inspired binary particle swarm optimization method. The results show that to charge PEVs during off-peak time and discharge PEV during peak time can bring significant benefits in terms of the economic cost. On the other hand, PEVs are promising to work together with the renewable generation to replace thermal units and gain profit.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","This research proposed a good solution for unit commitment problem.",,"56d8c77118b247.71687766","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56d8c77118b247.71687766&grantRef=EP%2FL001063%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/L001063/1","34FFD228-2F72-461E-AD54-A92D2D826225","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","EC23DA53-CA73-4104-A3F6-2A9523484E69","805BF1A0-B634-4558-BA5E-9CB38293A4AC"

The course runs for 3 weeks, covering the aims, methods, and practicalities of carrying out community-based research, especially with disadvantaged communities, providing a total of 12-15 hours of study, and is planned to run 2-3 times per year.

It is free and open to all on both platforms.

The English version makes full use of the social learning functionality in the FutureLearn platform, and the translation into the Arabic version emulates all the same functionality as far as possible within the Edraak version. This is the first time a course has run simultaneously in two languages, on two platforms.

The course is designed to engage researchers and professionals in a range of discipline areas in exchanging and debating the methods of CBR and the particular sensitivities that must be addressed, especially in communities that are disadvantaged, vulnerable, or living with extreme stress or trauma.

The two versions enable us to compare two very different demographic groups - one from the wider global English-speaking digital world, and the other from Arabic speakers in the MENA region.

The aim is to research the extent to which the co-design approach to development and adaptation of the course enables these communities of practice to develop into community knowledge-building communities, and what features have most impact on its sustainability in the longer run.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2019","Over 3,000 participants have engaged actively with at least one activity within the course over its first run on the two platforms.

The ultimate goal is to improve provision of 3D-Models for protein domain sequences via CATH, SWISS-MODEL and InterPro. Less than 10% of known sequences have experimentally characterised 3D structural information and yet this data is often essential for understanding the protein's molecular function and biological role and for determining whether residue mutations could damage the protein and lead to disease. So this integration is very timely as it will enhance links between sequence and structure data. APIs will be built using well established protocols and as well as promoting interoperability, and therefore sustainability, we will expand the data in each resource to ensure they serve a wider community of biologists.

The tool effectively glues together existing webservices from CATH and SWISS-MODEL to provide a pipeline that takes a protein sequence and ultimately exports one or more predicted 3D structures. The results of this pipeline will be made available in Genome3D which will then be made available to the wider community through export to InterPro and PDBe.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2019","This collaboration has proved useful in ongoing discussions and planning when setting up 3D Beacons network.","https://github.com/CATH-SWISSMODEL","5e6a2c9ea2e2f1.88128920","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e6a2c9ea2e2f1.88128920&grantRef=BB%2FR014892%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/R014892/1","2FBB10D6-0473-4C72-BA06-631237161FFD","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","F46ADFDD-DAA2-4094-ADC5-1D3676E95F0E"

The model parameters are known to vary according to the operating conditions, such as the battery state of charge (SOC). Therefore, online recursive ECM parameter estimation is one means that may help to improve the modelling accuracy. Because a battery system consists of both fast and slow dynamics, the classical least squares (LS) method, that estimates together all the model parameters, is known to suffer from numerical problems and poor accuracy. The aim of this paper is to overcome this problem by proposing a new decoupled weighted recursive least squares (DWRLS) method, which estimates separately the parameters of the battery fast and slow dynamics. Battery SOC estimation is also achieved based on the parameter estimation results. This circumvents an additional full-order observer for SOC estimation, leading to a reduced complexity. An extensive simulation study is conducted to compare the proposed method against the LS technique. Experimental data are collected using a Li-ion cell. Finally, both the simulation and experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed DWRLS approach can improve not only the modelling accuracy but also the SOC estimation performance compared with the LS algorithm.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2018","Battery equivalent circuit models are widely used in battery management system applications, and the model parameters depend on the operation conditions. Adaptive parameter estimation techniques can be used to track the parameter evolution and to improve the modelling accuracy. In addition, the battery system consisting of both fast and slow dynamics causes numerical problems to the traditional LS-based method for model parameter estimation. In order to overcome these problems, this paper proposes the novel DWRLS method which estimates separately the model fast and slow dynamics. SOC estimation is also achieved based on the ECM parameter estimation results, without the use of an additional full-order observer. Both the simulation and experimental studies have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed DWRLS method over the traditional LS algorithms in terms of modelling and state estimation accuracy. The results confirm convincingly that the proposed approach possesses enough capability for both offline model training, and online parameter and battery SOC estimation with high accuracy. This designed technique therefore has the high potential for realtime battery management applications in electric vehicles and other battery energy storage systems.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544217317127","5c8a4b314ba6e6.26945499","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c8a4b314ba6e6.26945499&grantRef=EP%2FL001063%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/L001063/1","34FFD228-2F72-461E-AD54-A92D2D826225","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","EC23DA53-CA73-4104-A3F6-2A9523484E69","805BF1A0-B634-4558-BA5E-9CB38293A4AC"

The tools intend to build capacity around visual research methods and communication through creative storytelling. These resources seek to draw on our organisational experience as well as our learnings from working collaboratively with our partners over the course of this project. The first iteration of these tools were used in visual storytelling workshops with our Myanmar partners at KRC in 2018. They are currently being refined to be used practically with our partners in the research and production processes taking place this year. These training resources will be made available to all partners in 2019 to aid in the visual research and production of our outputs. We will reflect on their efficacy and our learnings and refine the tools accordingly before making them publicly available at the end of the project. 


Further developments that have taken place in refining this methodology over the last year include:
-Deepening our ethnographic approach by working with more local artists where possible.
-Developing collaborative, sustained and networked ways of researching and producing creative research-based outputs. The work of PositiveNegatives is creating a new and innovative approaches to researching and producing these kinds of creative outputs - that can only be achieved through sustained engagement with local partners with deep contextual knowledge of the issues that we are working on. 
-Developing research methods around understanding the impact of creative storytelling in research settings (i.e. methods and tools around audience testing, production impact with collaborators such as researchers, artists and research participants)

In addition to continuing to develop this innovative and creative method we are also exploring how our creative outputs might be used as research tools themselves. This new and novel use of our outputs would represent a key shift in how qualitative research is conducted in these kinds of research environments. This year, we aim to pilot the use of our comics with our partners as hooks into broader discussions on drugs and conflict within interviews, focus groups, workshops, etc. In addition to acting as a prompt into the broader research themes, we also intend to use the initial R&amp;D outputs as research tools to guide our production and engagement work in the years to come, serving as research tools for how to engage the wider public, civil society and policy makers with the project findings creatively and innovatively.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","This handbook will enable collaborating partners in the focus countries, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Colombia to develop their understanding of visual and artistic research communication and the development of creative research methods (story-telling, life-histories) to facilitate innovative methods for analysing and presenting research data.

It belongs to a class of rare diseases, including spinocerebral ataxias, caused by expansions of CAG-repeat sequences within genes. We have developed a gene therapy approach, based on reducing the levels of the HD gene products, while maintaining the levels of the normal proteins. By designing a zinc finger protein (transcription factor repressor) to bind expanded CAG-repeats, we were the first to demonstrate efficient mutant Huntingtin (HTT) repression in mice, with a single treatment eliminating HD clasping symptoms for several weeks (Synthetic zinc finger repressors reduce mutant Huntingtin expression in the brains of R6/2 mice. PNAS 109: E3136-E3145, 2012). The original treatment only lasted a couple of weeks, but we have spent the last five years working on second and third generation constructs to allow sustained repression of mutant Huntingtin, in the whole brain (up to 80% lowering after AAV injection). We have recently published a new paper on this work, reporting how we can now achieve specific repression of mutant Huntingtin for a least six months (and maybe longer) after a single treatment (Agust&iacute;n-Pav&oacute;n et al.

Measurements of accessible chromatin are used extensively to identify genomic regulatory elements. Whilst chromatin landscapes of pluripotent stem cells are well characterised, chromatin accessibility changes in the development of somatic lineages are not well defined. Here we show that cell-specific chromatin accessibility data can be produced via ectopic expression of E. coli Dam methylase in vivo, without the requirement for cell-sorting (CATaDa). We have profiled chromatin accessibility in individual cell-types of Drosophila neural and midgut lineages. Functional cell-type-specific enhancers were identified, as well as novel motifs enriched at different stages of development. Finally, we show global changes in the accessibility of chromatin between stem-cells and their differentiated progeny. Our results demonstrate the dynamic nature of chromatin accessibility in somatic tissues during stem cell differentiation and provide a novel approach to understanding gene regulatory mechanisms underlying development.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2018","This paper describing this tool has been cited 33 times (Google Scholar) and has enabled key scientific findings e.g.

Determinations of myo-IP6 in soils and manure extracts are frequently performed by 31P NMR spectroscopy. This approach is time-consuming in terms of both sample preparation and instrument time, with uncertainties existing in relation to accuracy of identification and quantification due to potentially interfering resonances from co-extracted P species. In contrast, ion chromatography (IC) in combination with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) negative ion, electrospray ionisation (ESI) has been shown to enable highly specific identifications of myo-IP6 isolated from complex mixtures. In this paper, IC and ESI-HRMS were applied to the identification and the quantification of myo-IP6 isolated from soils and manures using NaOH-EDTA extraction, and quantifications based on IC. ESI-HRMS analysis of eluate trapped from IC unequivocally confirmed identification of myo-IP6 from a soil extract. The ion suppression cell of the IC instrument provides isolates of the analyte free of ionic components that would interfere with ESI. The myo-IP6 was identified in the NMR by comparing spectra of extracts of soils with and without authentic myo-IP6 &quot;spiked&quot; prior to extraction. Comparison of quantification via standard addition in IC and NMR analysis gave good correlation (r=0.955). IC with ESI-HRMS was found to be more sensitive, rapid and reliable for the identification and quantification of myo-IP6 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.7 mg kg-1 and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 2.1 mg kg-1 using IC versus &gt; 10 mg kg-1 LOD using 31P NMR.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2020","A novel method allowing accurate identification of dissolved organic phosphorus concentrations in environmental media.",,"5e66d132b0fb01.67538743","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e66d132b0fb01.67538743&grantRef=NE%2FK010689%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K010689/1","C2E859B5-8451-42A3-8ACE-B587117C3473","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","F3755C41-62CB-439D-959A-2B52F747D106"

Tips, insights and options are offered for planning, managing and delivering community research projects.
Recording and sharing the stories of those involved in community heritage research was the reason for our project. How a story is told affects if we remember it, how we understand and respond to it. Within community based heritage research processes, sharing stories of experience can reveal the underlying motivations and successful ingredients in sustaining local communities in their cultivation of heritage research. Recording and visualising (mapping) these stories formed the agenda of the 'Preserving Place: A Cultural Mapping exercise' AHRC funded Connected Communities project (2014-15).

We sought to co-produce a study with community-led heritage research groups and other local actors. Our participants were those involved in the first ever combination of UK Heritage Lottery Funded (HLF) community groups in conjunction with Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funded universities, who supported co-produced research into local tales of peoples and places in the 'All Our Stories' 2012-14 national programme.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2016","Has resulted in a new large-scale UEA research led, HLF funded community project, entitled '600 Paston Footprints', which has received a Phase 1 Heritage Grant in 2016-17.

Compact multispectral drone sensors capture high-resolution imagery in visible and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing for the calculation of vegetation indices, such as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) for productivity estimates and vegetation classification. Despite the technological advances, challenges remain in capturing high-quality data, highlighting the need for standardized workflows. Here, we discuss challenges, technical aspects, and practical considerations of vegetation monitoring using multispectral drone sensors and propose a workflow based on remote sensing principles and our field experience in high-latitude environments, using the Parrot Sequoia (Pairs, France) sensor as an example. We focus on the key error sources associated with solar angle, weather conditions, geolocation, and radiometric calibration and estimate their relative contributions that can lead to uncertainty of more than &plusmn;10% in peak season NDVI estimates of our tundra field site. Our findings show that these errors can be accounted for by improved flight planning, metadata collection, ground control point deployment, use of reflectance targets, and quality control. With standardized best practice, multispectral sensors can provide meaningful spatial data that is reproducible and comparable across space and time.

The techniques are not well understood and researchers face high set-up costs due to the technical knowledge and programming skills required for implementing machine learning classifiers. Extant research is limited to using Na&iuml;ve Bayes classifiers and the small set of studies that apply these techniques do not make their code and training data available publicly. This lack of transparency hampers progress and reduces replicability.
 
We use of suite of supervised machine learning algorithms including Na&iuml;ve Bayes, random forest, support vector machines, and a neural network to measure linguistic properties of management commentary provided in firms' preliminary earnings announcements. We measure the following three features of management performance-related commentary: tone (positive versus negative), the presence of at least one attribution by management explaining the reasons for reported performance, and the type of the attribution (i.e., relating to internal factors such as strategy, cost cutting, product quality etc. versus external factors such as macroeconomic conditions, consumer behaviour, extreme weather, etc.). 

Our training sample comprises a large set of manually annotated sentences for firms' earning announcements. We develop python code to train our classifiers and also to apply the resulting models out-of-sample. We provide the python code along with our training dataset to help researchers classify tone, attribution and attribution type on other datasets, and to refine our classifiers by adding additional features. The python code and annotated dataset are provided with step-by-step guidelines to help researchers implement and tweak our machine learning classifiers. As far as we are aware, this is first resource of this type to be developed and disseminated to accounting and finance researchers.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2020","No data available as yet","https://github.com/apmoore1/pea_classification","5e627bec4b8f25.21742831","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e627bec4b8f25.21742831&grantRef=ES%2FR003904%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/R003904/1","6D281DFC-CF12-4D84-B7DB-1FE7CBFB6FBB","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","D7B2E58E-FB16-474D-9E5C-D44254A2A766"

The digital storytelling component in Bolivia was facilitated by Tracey Osborne and Ioki&ntilde;e Rodr&iacute;guez with support from Heike Schroeder and Mirna Inturias. We worked with Indigenous leaders and community members of Lomerio, Bolivia to understand Indigenous perspectives of development and document this knowledge through digital storytelling. There were 3 main components to the digital storytelling workshop as carried out in Bolivia. We first led the community in a participatory mapping exercise where they identified the boundaries of their land and highlighted key sites of importance. Community leaders and members then led our group to sites of conventional development and the associated social and ecological impacts, as well as the effects of climate change. We visited sites of mining, cattle production, home gardens, and areas marked by climate change impacts. Finally, we provided training on digital storytelling which involved a story circle where community members shared stories of development and alternative indigenous perspectives. They then created story boards to organize their narratives and then we filmed their stories. This was intended as an initial training workshop after which the community planned to carry further digital stories. Unfortunately, the fires in Bolivia have put a halt on these activities as much of the land outside the region has been burned. The community plans to share stories of the impacts of these fires on their lives and livelihoods.

We also conducted digital storytelling workshops in Papua New Guinea. Emma Gilberthorpe, Bronya Kain, Phillip Gibbs, Lorelle Tekopiri Yakam and Tracey Osborne carried out fieldwork and digital storytelling in PNG 27 September to 4 October 2019 where we worked primarily in Tabubil and neighbouring communities. In discussion with community leaders, we discussed important sites of development and impact, and then travelled to sites to conduct interviews and record videos. We recorded short video interviews with key community leaders and members in locations such as the Ok Tedi mine, Ok Tedi river, a fish farm and a rice farm as well as in Tabubil offices.

These approaches were shaped by the ambitions of the case partners alongside the researchers' own practice-based and scholarly backgrounds. The practice-researchers worked in collaboration with organisational partner stakeholders and residents across rural Northumberland to co-produce artistic and developmental interventions. These included: music commissions; participatory workshops; a community exhibition; programme development and funding strategies; and a creative writing commission. A set of methodologies was used to describe the activity and processes of knowledge exchange in order to make knowledge exchange itself more meaningful, interactive, and reciprocal.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2014","Our research and consultation practice have developed a number of insights into KE practices in rural communities:
• Ethnography and the role of the researcher: the development of artistic approaches to experimental ethnographic research in communities, including how to trace and articulate ethnographically the process of KE as mediated by artistic interventions.
• Third space practice: new ways of thinking about where research is situated in a neutral 'third space' position in relation to the University, research partners and the community members.
• The microscopics of community practice: that only a sustained and intimate engagement with arts, communities and social relations - and recognition of the complexity of that relationship - does justice to the nature of communities.
• Multiple knowledge circulations: that rather than thinking about one-way transfer or two- or three-way exchange, we both practice and describe the multiple and complex circulations of knowledge around arts in communities.
• The role of the university: that universities have to pre-design and co-design research projects in order to maintain effective KE relationships with communities. This includes establishing KE processes that are genuinely participatory and issues of legacy once interventions come to an end. Trust is a vital ingredient and, if small arts organisations are to be involved in research, remuneration is often vital.
• Creativity and entrepreneurship in rural communities: we have described fluid and complex relations around the multiple ways that arts organisations pursue strategies of sustainability. The project has also helped to reveal the hidden value and contribution of arts programmes and organisations to rural places and communities, and their connections to the wider North East. 
• Families, lineages, and cultural production: this is an essential facet of who speaks for certain kinds of knowledge and who is seen to have 'authority' in performing rurality in the arts.
• Knowledge sharing and resistance: we have mapped and understood the challenges around the ownership of information in rural communities and who speaks for it and to whom.
• Networking in rural cultures: this is complex, fragmented and enmeshed in difficulties around travel, broadband and personalities.
• Archiving cultures in Northumberland: how we do this digitally in a way that can be maintained into the future and about different kinds of archives and intellectual property rights and the university's role in this.
• Indigeneity and outsiders: that this is a central theme in who practices art and who represents and speaks for communities.
• The peculiarities of rural arts practice: that there is something distinctive about arts practice in rural areas which is not simply perpetuating a rural/urban duality.
• Dissemination of findings practice: there are new and exciting ways of disseminating information through networks that go beyond the narrowness of current academic practice.
• Landscape and culture: that relations and networks around land and landscape are central to thinking about identity and artistic representation.
• Interdisciplinarity: that there are exciting ways of thinking about doing transdisciplinary work in communities and across University schools, agencies and regions that still hold to some sense of social-scientific discipline and ethics. The project has also revealed something of the nature and value of different kinds of knowledge to knowledge production more generally",,"545e3defddbf92.32410234","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=545e3defddbf92.32410234&grantRef=AH%2FK002678%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/K002678/1","D5FF9BFE-8627-4E5F-8800-7A6E6B1A02BD","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68","D4421920-39E4-4CD2-985C-5CBE678B5853"

The charge/discharge process on a single graphite flake over long time cycling (up to 50 times at 1/2 0C), can be observed via subtle changes of the signal, and used as an early diagnostic probe during the degradation process. 
Both the shear mode and the layer-breathing mode, due to the relative motion of the graphene sheets at the ULF range, usually fall below the notch and edge filter cut-off of many spectrometers. To this end, we have developed an in-situ, ultra-low frequency (ULF) Raman technique. We expect that the ULF signal will reveal useful information regarding the degradation process during battery cycling.
We have also assessed the possibility to use machine learning to analyse in-situ Raman data. The purpose here is to create a diagnostic tool for the identification of key parameters and degradation causes during battery cycling.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2019","The method can serve as an early diagnostic probe for better understanding of the degradation process and fingerprinting different battery materials against Lithium intercalation during cycling and related degradation mechanisms.","https://www.graphene.cam.ac.uk/facilities/raman","5e593eb5635120.24246426","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e593eb5635120.24246426&grantRef=EP%2FS003053%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/S003053/1","26394DF8-FDA9-4E28-AE74-51600EE17294","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","CD843521-A2DF-49EA-9588-36B25E7101B0","3F3EFB3B-8BC3-4289-85E4-DFEEBA593FF6"

This toolkit allows for customization of queries along the lines of natural language, giving users the ability to ask questions of social media datasets based on any choice of input search terms.

This includes queries directly linked to modern slavery, as well as ancillary topics related to other major societal topics, such as climate change and international elections. To make this process more systematic, we focused on a proof-of-concept rule dictionary, capturing the 32 discrete dimensions within Gardner et al's (2020) SDRCS framework. We extended this list to 36 test dimensions based on a combination of splitting dimensions in the original framework, and adding additional dimensions relevant to the specific context of modern slavery (and its presentation) during COVID-19. &quot;Victims&quot;, &quot;Immigration&quot; and &quot;Survivors&quot; are the most prominent dimensions in our test dataset.

POCIS (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) can be used to trap these compounds onto an appropriate sorbent material, to allow a fuller picture to emerge of the range of DOM compounds present in the natural environment. In this work, undertaken by a 4th year undergraduate project student, Laurie Brummitt, supervised by our WP2, the use of POCIS as a means of deriving a representative sample of this material was assessed and compared to conventional grab sampling methods. Modified pharmaceutical POCIS were deployed upstream and downstream of the Chew Valley sewage treatment works outfall for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days.Comparative grab samples were taken at each time point and extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) with Oasis hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) solid phase cartridges. The amount of extracted organic carbon (EOC) in each of the samples was assessed by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. The grab samples showed a consistent DOM concentration, with little deviation between the upstream and downstream samples. From the TOC results the grab sample extraction efficiency was calculated to be 47 - 60%. The POCIS samples exhibited a linear uptake of organic carbon in both locations, with the downstream diverging to higher EOC concentrations. Samples were qualitatively assessed for compositional differences, with respect to the location and sampling method employed, using high-performance liquid chromatography- electrospray ionisation- Orbitrap mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS) and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254 nm). From the HPLC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS data, compounds linearly accumulating onto the POCIS were prioritised, and separated into those with purely anthropogenic origins and those ubiquitous to the river. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) spectra of these compounds were acquired and compared to the online database mzCloud. The only match was citalopram, a common pharmaceutical, emitted from the sewage treatment plant effluent. Polypropylene glycol, also originating from the effluent, was identified from the MS2 spectra. POCIS was shown to be a viable option for untargeted analysis of DOM, although grab sampling should be used as well to provide a more comprehensive picture of DOM as not all compounds are polar and will therefore not be trapped by the POCIS.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","2019","None yet.

In addition, there is a small, dynamic ambient pool of urea in soil associated with metabolic functioning in the microbial community. The diacetyl monoxime (DAM) colorimetric method is routinely used to quantify urea in soil, however, it lacks specificity due to the potential to react with the ureido group (R1NHCONHR2), a common structural moiety in soil organic matter. The aim of this study was therefore to critically evaluate the accuracy of this method for urea determination in soil. Using the DAM assay, we demonstrated significant cross-reactivity with a range of ureido compounds, many of which are ubiquitous in soil. We conclude therefore that the DAM assay is highly likely to overestimate urea concentrations in environmental materials. Such overestimation was confirmed using high resolution HPLC Orbitrap MS to quantify urea in grassland soils using standard addition and the concentrations compared with those of the DAM assay. The results obtained show the DAM colorimetric method overestimated urea concentration by between 7.2 and 58 times for the sites studied. This significant overestimation of urea emphasises the need to validate the colorimetric method with reference to the LC-MS assay to ensure the robustness of measured urea concentrations. On this basis we recommend that reporting of the results from the DAM colorimetric method as &quot;urea&quot; concentration be curtailed and reported as &quot;ureido-N&quot; to recognise the contribution of unknown and variable contributions from other compounds. Indeed, given the problems with quantitatively assessing the latter contributions we would recommend the DAM method is now avoided in surveys of urea concentrations in soil and the wider environment.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2019","Refinement of our understanding of the non-specificity of a standard analytical technique used widely in environmental research.",,"5e66d1fe106e38.00311806","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e66d1fe106e38.00311806&grantRef=NE%2FK010689%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K010689/1","C2E859B5-8451-42A3-8ACE-B587117C3473","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","F3755C41-62CB-439D-959A-2B52F747D106"

The development of this indicator tool to measure emotion and emotional well-being is in response to a call for broader and more holistic approaches to measuring water-security. Complementing the conventional indicators of water security (water quality, quantity or adequacy, source or reliability, and affordability); the analysis of emotional wellbeing provides a way to expand on the direct and indirect ways water security can impact on communities, particularly in detecting societal and/or cultural differences in the experience of water security such as gender and disability in communities. The tool was built on the proven premise that water security is a key determinant of wellbeing and varying levels of access to water triggers emotional responses from populations. The methodological innovation in our tool is via the measurement of emotional wellbeing in different dimensions taking into account valance (positivity v negativity), arousal (active v passive) and discrete emotions. Such sensitivities allow assessment of whether needs are being meet but also provides insights in terms of identifying the types of intervention approach that can be used within populations (e.g. those with high negativity and arousal may be conflict risks).","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","Throughout the 18 month project we provided proof-of-concept of the indicator tool for pastoralist populations in the Lowlands of Ethiopia.

Model development for the Conwy

We used a tidal model (Telemac Modelling System V7.2; www.opentelemac.org) to simulate circulation and water quality in the Conwy estuary and surrounding coast. The Telemac model was set-up in vertically-averaged mode. The model simulates in space and time the evolution of elevations, water depths, velocities, salinities, temperatures and dispersion of dissolved substances such as nutrients and viruses with or without die-off. Telemac uses an unstructured mesh, which in this case comprised 120,000 nodes connected on an unstructured triangular configuration (Fig. 1). This mesh was mapped on to observational bathymetry data, with varying resolution; being very high within the estuary (~20m) and coarser o?shore (50m-2km). Bathymetry for the Conwy estuary has been attained from the UK Government's ADMIRALTY Marine Data Portal (www.admiralty.co.uk/ukho), as well as in-house (Bangor) surveys within the estuary and LiDAR data from the Environment Agency. Additionally, bathymetry data in the outer estuary and surrounding coast has been attained from Admiralty data products at 200 m spatial resolution (digimap.edina.ac.uk/marine).

The model is hydrostatic and based on the depth-averaged shallow water equations of momentum and continuity (Hervouet, 2007), with depth-averaged turbulent mixing (Rastogi and Rodi, 1978). For more information on the model parameterisation, see Robins et al. (2019). For information on model validation, please see Robins et al. (2014).","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2019","The Telemac model is well suited to vertically-mixed coastal applications since the mesh can be optimised to adequately resolve coastal features and the model incorporates wetting/drying capabilities of inter-tidal regions.",,"5e6223754322f7.96022116","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e6223754322f7.96022116&grantRef=NE%2FS004548%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/S004548/1","B90696F1-1793-48FC-9B97-DFB61B6A92A9","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","F9F1D136-12E3-4BE4-9668-0C9BC4A7C1BF","09A4D58F-AFCE-471E-A0A4-33F2E62CE474"

In detail, it requires the documentation and keeping up to date the scripts in the front- and back-end of the web platform, as well as the scraping of the ModelDB database for the identification of new ion channel models, appropriate code inspection and electrophysiological simulation protocol running, collection of related publication metadata (brain region, animal, cell type, etc.), and, finally, publication to the ICG platform. For this purpose Mr. Bozelos developed an array of web scraping and data extraction script utilities for automated parsing of new ModelDB entries, while the inspection, curation, and protocol running tasks are still done manually to ensure the highest quality of results for the ICG. Thus far, in the period of December 2017 - October 2018, 754 new channels have been identified for the families Kv, Nav, Cav and IH, and thoroughly characterized as described above. We believe that appropriate maintenance and sustained development of the existing database will ensure effective support to the community of computational neuroscientists, for whom informed the process of ion channel model selection is critical for successful simulation approaches. 

In order to ensure functionality and seamless integration to the existing database, Dr Alex Seeholzer developed a set of scripts to upload channels to ICG and GitHub as well as to perform re-clustering of the channel catalog. On January 2019 we concluded the process of updating the ICG database. In sum, we added 392 new Kv channels, 238 new Nav channels, 113 new Cav channels and 11 new IH channels, that are now browsable via the different visualizations available on ICG. New channels are also available at the GitHub repository of the ICG project: https://github.com/icgenealogy thus supporting ICG's open source mission with the developer community.

Further direction in the maintenance of the ICG platform include: 
Update the scripts required for the addition of new channels.
Document the process of importing new channels to the database.
Automate as much as possible the curation process of new channels. For this purpose we will require the development of machine learning tools for natural language processing and web scraping, among others.","Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo","","","Yes","2016","Continued and improved visitor numbers of about 800+ visits per year.","https://icg.neurotheory.ox.ac.uk","5e6a0d791574e9.22555071","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e6a0d791574e9.22555071&grantRef=BB%2FN019512%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/N019512/1","25E3803F-A5CE-40D6-88A0-D63A642DEF31","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","4E2B8B86-EBAC-465B-BED1-FD4AD1BA6380"

The methodology and project centred 16 persons with disabilities living in Northern Uganda who were employed as co-researchers and co-producers of this research, and thus became part of the project team. Co-researchers were selected through and by project partner in Uganda (YOLRED), based on those who were in urgent need of support and had been severely impacted during the pandemic. Co-researchers comprised of ex-child soldiers and non-ex child soldiers, and 12 women and 4 men; a greater proportion of women were included to support sustainable development goals 5 (gender equality) and 10.2 (reduced inequalities). 

The project team worked together to provide new evidence to produce a disability-specific and inclusive situational analysis for Northern Uganda (amongst other outputs), which addressed the needs of persons with disabilities, who have been excluded from pandemic safety and recovery measures. Co-researchers, rather than being participants of this project, held temporary contracts issued by YOLRED to carry out the project - making them an integral part of the research team as opposed to merely research subjects. They worked on this project from July 2021 to January 2022, which included four weeks of data collection workshops (carried out over three months), planning dissemination events, attending and participating at civil society outreach activities, and during the stakeholder meetings. All co-researchers and project team were paid the same during the data collection and dissemination workshops, to ensure an equitable distribution of resources.

During the first week of the data collection workshops, co-researchers were trained on ethics and consent procedures, as well as the rationale for the project and expected outputs and outcomes. Informed consent, designed by the project team in line with the University of Bristol and National ethnics committee in Uganda's requirements, was requested upon recruitment of co-researchers and again during the first day of data collection, and then redesigned by the co-researchers based on their understandings of consent, and was ongoing throughout the project period.

During the second week of the data collection workshops, co-researchers were trained on research methodologies and data collection tools, which included interviews, focus groups, surveys, questionnaires, as well as reminded of the local Acholi ways of knowing and sharing, including storytelling and arts-based performances (i.e., poetry, singings, drama). The data collection methods and tools, including questions to be asked and questions not to be asked, were then co-developed by the co-researchers, who selected three techniques: peer-to-peer interviews, focus groups, and arts-based techniques. Co-developing methods and practice ensured this project was able to mitigate potential risk and harm for co-researchers. This also increased trust and rapport between researchers and co-researchers, and facilitated better safeguarding practice. Co-researchers themselves have an understanding of the sensitivity required when engaging with people with disabilities, and were able to guide where questions or methods would cause harm or be potentially traumatic, and as such these were omitted.

During week 3 of the PAR workshops, co-researchers were asked to think through and discuss possible strategies for pandemic recovery and solutions for how to 'build back better'. They explored this using a variety of methods, including poems, storytelling, peer-to-peer discussions, and focus groups. From this, outputs were designed accordingly. For example, an animated video was produced for which the script and storyboard was designed by the co-researchers and the narration provided by them. Other outputs and strategies have been similar informed or directed by them, as a collective.

Week 4 of the PAR workshops concluded the data collection with a dissemination event for the friends and family of co-researchers, for them to showcase their learnings, discoveries, and achievements from the project, and share their experiences of the pandemic with their families in a safe space, with the support of the project team. The agenda and schedule for this event was arranged and led by the co-researchers, who also used this space to present their arts-based performances.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2022","Co-researchers have reported significant changes emerging from their involvement in this project. Firstly, they have stated economic empowerment and confidence-building through being officially employed on this project as co-researchers. Secondly, they have obtained greater awareness and insights into their individual and collective rights under Ugandan law. Thirdly, they have developed new skills, friendships, and networks which has supported their social and mental development and growth. 

Academic colleagues and researchers who are wanting to engage in equitable North-South partnerships, PAR methodologies, or utilising indigenous knowledge systems have reported gaining inspiration from this methodology and recognising its importance in contributing to locally informed research agendas. 

YOLRED, the project partner in Uganda, have also reported skills and knowledge development for their staff and team employed on this project, and their desire to utilise this methodology in all future research projects. They have stated that it has built their capacity and confidence as a team, as well as developed their local and national networks; and strengthened their relationship and status within the local Acholi community and with their beneficiaries who have been employed on this project.",,"622e679dc37ac0.89863317","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=622e679dc37ac0.89863317&grantRef=AH%2FV013432%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/V013432/1","2BA4D34F-1A85-46A6-957F-B36D67B18E9C","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","D6D774FB-B26F-4ADF-9E65-FB90F91CB885"

Alejandra","","Host DNA is protected by the cement that glues head lice nits to the hair of ancient mummies. Ancient lice morphology help gather information on ancient environmental parameters before the death of the hosts","Over the past few decades, there has been a growing demand for genome analysis of ancient human remains. Destructive sampling is increasingly difficult to obtain for ethical reasons, and standard methods of breaking the skull to access the petrous bone or sampling remaining teeth are often forbidden for curatorial reasons. However, most ancient humans carried head lice and their eggs abound in historical hair specimens. Here we show that host DNA is protected by the cement that glues head lice nits to the hair of ancient Argentinian mummies, 1,500-2,000 years old. The genetic affinities deciphered from genome-wide analyses of this DNA inform that this population migrated from north-west Amazonia to the Andes of central-west Argentina; a result confirmed using the mitochondria of the host lice. The cement preserves ancient environmental DNA of the skin, including the earliest recorded case of Merkel cell polyomavirus. We found that the percentage of human DNA obtained from nit cement equals human DNA obtained from the tooth, yield 2-fold compared with a petrous bone, and 4-fold to a bloodmeal of adult lice a millennium younger. In metric studies of sheaths, the length of the cement negatively correlates with the age of the specimens, whereas hair linear distance between nit and scalp informs about the environmental conditions at the time before death. Ectoparasitic lice sheaths can offer an alternative, nondestructive source of high-quality ancient DNA from a variety of host taxa where bones and teeth are not available and reveal complementary details of their history.","Biological samples","","","Yes","2021","Initially to professionals working on ancient DNA; for Holocene samples from archaeological sites the methods provide new means, non-destructive sampling methods to study human history and evolution throughout their lice.

It also includes some specialist functions including geostatistical methods, mixed model fitting of water retention curve parameters and a function for maximum likelihood fitting of normal or log-normal distributions to censored data.

CEPHaStat_2 was released in May 2020 for use in project training with some revisions and additional functions.

The aim of the work undertaken as part of Award NE/R017964/1 is to reassess the resource assessment published by Andrews (2013) in light of the new data that has been generated since then. Recent publications (Hennissen et al., 2017; Hennissen and Gent, 2019) highlighted current resource assessments rely heavily on calculated Vitrinite Reflectance (VR) rather than actual VR analysis, which has a higher degree of uncertainty resulting in less accurate resource estimation that are communicated to the public. 
Vitrinite Reflectance is the most widely used and is demonstrably most robust tool to assess the thermal maturity of organic matter in conventional and unconventional systems. Thermal maturity is a vital parameter to constrain resource assessments because it reflects the burial depth sediments have been exposed to which ultimately determines how much hydrocarbons are retained in the surrounding formations.

Vitrinite reflectance determination is a vital skill that was missing from the energy portfolio at the British Geological Survey (BGS). Co-funded by BGS, I attended a two week training course with Prof. Paulo Fernandes at the Universidade do Algarve to gain a working knowledge of the technique (preparation and analysis) for BGS to be self-sufficient for VR analysis. With additional funding from the BGS we acquired standards to calibrate existing equipment (reflected light microscope with a 50X oil immersion objective) and laboratory consumables to prepare samples using our existing infrastructure (the Biostratigraphy and Palaeontology Laboratory).

Vitrinite reflectance is routinely used with coals and conventional hydrocarbon targets. We will now explore how more effectively implement this technique for the Carboniferous dark shales which are the target of the resource assessment conducted as part of Award. In the future we will also explore how image analysis can be used to partly automate this technique to make analysis more efficient.

The levofloxacin model developed from this data was used to analyse the levofloxacin paediatric PK data on the novel paediatric 250 mg formulation developed for the TB-CHAMP PK lead-in study. Data were compared to our previously developed paediatric levofloxacin population PK model (See Denti et al, 2017).
To inform TB-CHAMP study implementation and practical dosing of study drug in young children, we completed a lead-in study of the PK, acceptability and palatability of this novel dispersible formulation in children &lt;5 years of age, exposed to MDR-TB. Levofloxacin 15-20mg was administered once daily by caregivers to children for 7-14 days. Tablets were administered whole, crushed or dissolved in water. A questionnaire was administered to 15 caregivers on the last day of levofloxacin administration. In brief, following intensive PK sampling (6 time points), data from 24 children (144 samples) dosed with the new dispersible tablet were compared with the prediction from the model derived above. An estimation of the difference in the bioavailability was completed for the novel formulation, while maintaining other model parameters as constant. Re-estimation of the PK parameters of the model was completed for the original cohort study. Figure 1 shows substantially higher exposures with the novel dispersible formulation in children, which was mostly due to improved bioavailability of this formulation (Garcia-Prats, in progress)_. Shaded areas are where the model predicts/expects the various percentiles of the data to fall. Lines are the percentiles of the data). No AEs occurred in this sample of 24 children. The safety and efficacy of this dispersible formulation will be systematically evaluated in the TB CHAMP trial.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","Yes","2017","These data indicate substantially higher exposures of levofloxacin using the novel dispersible trial formulation and has informed the more conservative dosing guidance for levofloxacin using this formulation in our trial, and also for routine clinical use (e.g. through in -country procurement through the Global Drug Facility and WHO).

Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was first identified in 1961; resistance is conferred by a single gene, mecA, which encodes a penicillin binding protein (PBP2a) with a low affinity for ß-lactam antibiotics (including methicillin), and which is located in a mobile staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC, or SCCmec when harbouring a mecA gene). MRSA is sub-classified as hospital acquired (HA-MRSA), community acquired (CA-MRSA) or livestock associated (LA-MRSA); the latter emerged in the early 2000's and provides a reservoir of infection for both farm animals and humans. 

A recent PhD project in the Department of Veterinary Medicine (Defra/Hefce funded) exploring the epidemiology of bovine mastitis identified a novel strain of S. aureus, which although testing negative for mecA or PBP2a using established tests, was found to be phenotypically resistant to ß-lactam antibiotics at levels that would normally identify it as MRSA.

Research into this isolate, led by Dr Mark Holmes culminated in whole genome sequencing of this isolate (in collaboration with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute) which found that the genetic basis for the ß-lactam resistant phenotype was a novel mecA gene, provisionally named mecALGA251 but since reclassified as mecC. mecC was found to be located in a novel SCCmec (type XI). The failure to detect the mecA homologue using PCR was due to the low sequence conservation between mecA and mecC, with 60 % homology at the DNA level and 63% at the amino acid level. New PCR primers were designed to enable detection of this new MRSA. 

Following the design of new PCR primers a further 13 mecC MRSA isolates were found in a collection of 940 S. aureus isolates from 465 UK herds which had submitted mastitic milk samples to the UK Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA). These isolates were among 24 found to have high levels of antibiotic resistance consistent with MRSA status, but not identified as MRSA using established PCR assays (using specific primers for mecA) and slide latex agglutination (using a monoclonal antibody specific for PBP2a).

The discovery of mecC as outlined above raised important questions about the detection and confirmation of MRSA in humans, and resulting decisions about patient care. Based on current molecular diagnostic tests at the time, patients presenting with mecC S. aureus could wrongly be diagnosed as methicillin susceptible rather than methicillin resistant, given the relatively low sequence conservation between mecC and mecA, on which such tests were based. The importance of work was indicated by its dissemination prior to publication via the EuroStaph network, and led the immediate adoption of the Holmes group's PCR primers, or use of their sequence data, for mecC detection of MRSA by MRSA reference laboratories in England &amp; Wales, Scotland, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Belgium.
 
In April 2011, a meeting was called by Prof Maria Zambon, Director of HPA Microbiology at Colindale to explore the potential impact of the discovery of mecC on human health, and on MRSA screening programmes, and to discuss the epidemiology of the new MRSA in humans and animals. The outcome of the risk assessments undertaken at this meeting are now being used to inform the Department of Health, the Health Protection Agency and other relevant bodies of the potential risks and how they might be mitigated.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2012","Based on the work of the Holmes group, and in collaboration with them, microbiology reference laboratories have now developed a number of tests to distinguish mecC from mecA that is more appropriate for reference laboratory use (i.e. multiplex PCRs that include species confirmation and mecA, in addition to detection of mecC).

In hospital settings, there is increasing use of automated PCR testing, and test equipment is currently being updated to make provision for mecC screening of patients presenting with suspected MRSA, by the main test providers (namely Roche and Becton Dickinson). A commercial microarray based MRSA test system incorporating mecC sequence data has been developed and is now being marketed (Greiner bio-one, Genspeed MRSA Test System). A commercial qRT-PCR system incorporating primers for mecC is marketed by ELITech (MRSA/SA ELITe MGB&reg; Kit). The European Union Reference Laboratory for Antibiotic Resistance has published a recommended protocol PCR protocol for the detection of MRSA incorporating primers for mecC.",,"5c87943d450144.00060457","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c87943d450144.00060457&grantRef=G1001787","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=G1001787","F5F06115-0388-4DD0-BA8D-29C59832AA70","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","7D2EF629-B2FA-4A66-BBC6-1DEC3ADC99F5"

The tool-kit has been included as part of a collaboration with AQMeN researchers at Sheffield University and the government of Hebei Province in China to analyse the spatial dynamics of poverty, pollution and health in Hebei.. Hebei province has some of the most polluted cities in the world. A key priority for the 74 million people who live there is to
find ways of reducing air pollution and to address the associated social and health inequalities. It is crucial that the true cost of pollution is included in economic planning. The first step is to develop the necessary data infrastructure needed to provide the government a clear picture of how pollution, health and social deprivation are related and how they have
changed over time. The potential for impact is exceptional due to: (a) the scale and importance of the problem we are seeking to address, and (b) access to senior policy makers made possible through collaboration with the Hebei Institute of Statistical Sciences (HISS). This project offers an outstanding opportunity to make a step change in the quality and richness of evidence available to decision makers in Hebei Province. The new project will give researchers an opportunity to make the statistical innovations of the AQMeN project more accessible and more widely known, including this HSAR (Hierarchical Spatial Autoregressive Model) R toolkit , and techniques for computing inference using Bayesian
CAR (Conditional Auto Regressive) methods.

The methodology seeks to create connections between humans and non-humans through embodied engagements rather than purely intellectual ones by i) facilitating sensory experiences with materialities from or related to objects of interest ii) creating a space where people can perform or relate differently to the object of interest. 

This methodology has been developed into a tripartite structure through the Man Food Project - as described in the Man Food toolbox. Workshop 1: what is protein? Workshop 2: How do different proteins feeling in the body? Workshop 3: When have you changed what you eat? Each workshop is devised from the constituent elements of the Becoming Ecological citizenship methodology.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2016","The methodology was used in the Man Food project has the foundation for the workshops that are describe in the Man Food Toolbox.

Although several Centre members are highly knowledgeable about bioinformatics, the goal of the bioinformatics resource and the High Performance Computing Cluster is to provide expertise for the Centre community. The resource is led by Dr Leo Schalkwyk and is supported by two Centre-funded posts, one for bioinformatics (Dr Matthew Davies who was employed in September 2008) and one for programming and co-ordinating the Centre's Linux cluster which currently links 31 compute nodes and provides 64 AMD Opteron 64-bit CPUs with 82 Gb RAM (Mr Stuart Newman). Bioinformatics applications serve two main functions: data integration and data analysis. The cluster is vital to provide both capacity and speed: capacity to store, integrate and distribute large databases, and speed to perform compute-intensive calculations. The cluster is crucial not only for bioinformatics analyses but also for statistical genetics such as analyses of microarray data, meta-analyses and quantitative genetic maximum-likelihood structural equation analyses. 

Other key issues that are addressed by the team include bioinformatics approaches to the analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) both by pooling and individual genotyping, the use of machine-learning techniques for data integration in interpreting GWAS results, and studies of correlational structure of gene expression profiles across tissues using mouse reference populations.

Before I successfully applied this method to marine sediments from the West Antarctic continental shelf in the Amundsen Sea (Hillenbrand et al. 2010, J. Quat. Sci.), the technique had been applied only twice for constraining the timing of Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat following the Last Glacial Maximum by other colleagues. Further analyses carried out by me and my collaborators, however, showed that in some instances the method of dating marine sediments by analyzing their magnetic intensity fails to provide reliable ages for grounded ice-sheet retreat because the global signal of temporal changes in Earth's magnetic field is overprinted in the sediments by changes in magnetic grain size and/or magnetic mineralogy (Hillenbrand et al. 2010, Geophys.

Substantial populations of cerebral cortical neurons are generated in a specific sequence by the radial glia progenitors that line the ventricular surface during development. These radial progenitors self-renew and generate intermediate progenitors or neurons in a precisely choreographed fashion. 
in utero electroporation has become a central technique in the study of key aspects of neural development, such as progenitor proliferation, neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and circuit formation. This method has also facilitated the exploitation of cell lineage and optogenetic techniques in various species from chick to gyrencephalic higher mammals. This chapter provides a description of the method and gives some examples for its utility in the study of cerebral cortical development and evolution.","http://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-3014-2_2","56cc989fd787f1.42216374","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56cc989fd787f1.42216374&grantRef=G0900901","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=G0900901","8BE58135-8DB7-4CF2-B2F9-E5666CA534BA","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","0D476B57-83D7-40C9-AC5D-EC980E83BB10"

Lipids account for ~3% of dry weight in grasses. There is an incentive to breed grasses with lipid content up to ~6% to improve ruminant livestock productivity and suppress methane emissions. Using wheat as a model grass, we have identified a gain-of-function mutant in a lipid biosynthetic enzyme that's associated with an increase in leaf lipid content. The aim is to test if the mutation is causal by transforming wheat with a copy of the mutant allele or with a wild type allele as a control.

The purpose of the tool is to integrate the effects of different physical process parameterisations on air masses throughout the domain during model simulations. It has been developed for variables that are approximately conserved following air parcels, so that the effects of non-conservative processes can be readily separated from the conservative (adiabatic and frictionless) dynamics of the atmosphere. Examples of variables that are traced include potential temperature and potential vorticity. The relevant model processes that are traced using the technique are longwave and shortwave radiation, convection, cloud microphysics, sub-grid scale turbulence and gravity wave drag. A Met Office CASE PhD student, Leo Saffin, developed this tool further by closing the budget accounting explicitly for the non-conservative effects of the &quot;dynamical core&quot; of the model - the part that represents fluid mechanics without considering cloud, radiation and other processes. One purpose of the tool is to understand how different physical processes influence the nonlinear evolution of weather systems. A second purpose is to trace back forecast errors, identified using observations, to the misrepresentation of physical processes by the model. This is a very challenging task and the new tool enables quantification of effects in a way that was not possible before.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2013","One purpose of the tool is to understand how different physical processes influence the nonlinear evolution of weather systems.

This new method clearly shows an enhanced resolution over conventional MLST analysis. e have created a standardized cgMLST scheme that allows for fast typing of V. parahaemolyticus from WGS data in a publicly available database. This cgMLST scheme was tested with a diverse set of strains belonging to the same or unrelated outbreaks and was able to differentiate them accordingly, therefore showing a great potential for use in outbreak investigations. Application of this cgMLST scheme to V. parahaemolyticus strains collected by different laboratories around the world will help define the global picture of the epidemiology, spread, and evolution of this pathogen. All of this information will be critical in its application to outbreak investigations, providing a unique repository of genomes that can be used for unambiguous comparisons of data generated worldwide.

High-grade brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is considered a cancer of unmet clinical need, in part due to GBM cell infiltration into healthy brain parenchyma making complete surgical resection improbable. Modelling the process of GBM invasion in real time is challenging as it requires both tumor and neural tissue compartments. Here, we demonstrate that human GBM spheroids possess the ability to spontaneously infiltrate early-stage cerebral organoids (eCO). The resulting formation of hybrid organoids demonstrated an invasive tumor phenotype that was distinct from non-cancerous adult neural progenitor (NP) spheroid incorporation into eCOs. These findings provide a basis for the modelling and quantification of the GBM infiltration process using a stem cell-based organoid approach, and may be used for the identification of anti-GBM invasion strategies.","Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human","","","Yes","2018","Not yet applicable; publication in press",,"5aa644f63323c5.30331562","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5aa644f63323c5.30331562&grantRef=MR%2FJ001171%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/J001171/1","E6860B57-223D-4840-BC01-7AB4C88D59C0","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","78F6BB97-4E4A-4420-B0C2-C639E1545F2E"

In a real-world environment, it can also be challenging to physically access the room and change the plates manually in a timely manner without causing inconvenience to the patient or for safety reasons where a patient may have a contagious disease. I created a novel Automated Multi-Plate Air Sampler (AMPAS) for surface sampling purposes to obtain accurate results, and to collect samples at precise intervals with minimal human intervention. This device allows us to capture the transient effects without human intervention. To the best of our knowledge, there is no commercial equivalent to this device. 
The implementation included building (from scratch) the electrical and electronic circuit, the mechanical aspects including motors and shafts, and the programming and configuration of the device using an Arduino controller. I have performed extensive testing and validation for the device in different environments (controlled environment, office environment, and hospital environment) simultaneously performing air sampling to optimize the efficiency of the device and to obtain accurate and reliable data in terms of both timing and data collection.","Biological samples","","","Yes","2021","This device enabled us to quantify the deposition rate of airborne microorganisms on surfaces in both controlled and real-world environments where there is a risk involved with human intervention.

This technique can be applied for the recovery of 2-D temperature and velocity field information at the interface of any flow with a sufficient density gradient between the two fluid phases. The technique relies on a single infrared imager (IR) and is based on the employment of highly reflective particles (in IR wavelengths) which can be distinguished from the surrounding fluid domain due to their different emissivity. The processing is based on the decomposition of the raw IR images into separate thermal and particle images.

It is mainly based on citizen science, with gardeners collecting data on diaries that reserachers designed. Data is uploaded on a database shared between researchers and subsequently visualised through charts on the project's website (www.fewmeter.org). Gardeners and the general public can access the website and utilise the information made available. A second set of data was collected by researchers, which include measurements of all materials utilised in the garden for food production (e.g. timber for raised beds and PVC pipes for irrigation) as well as surveys on the impact on wellbeing and economy of participants. The former set of data is used to develop an LCA for each garden and the latter to determine social benefits. Each set of data is analysed to ascertain the resource efficiency of urban agriculture and the social benefits accrued. Articles are being drafted to document these studies. The tool is presented in a dedicated paper (Applying the food-energy-water nexus approach to urban agriculture: From FEW to FEWP (Food-Energy-Water-People - see publication section).

Data collection for the first year (2019) ran from 1 March to 31 October and in the UK we collected data on water use; compost, fertiliser, seeds, pesticide use; harvest data and data on number of social and educational events held in the gardens during the year. We also measured all the infrastructure in each garden space to inform a later LCA for each garden and completed questionnaires with garden managers and volunteers. Having met with farmers and gardeners in February 2020, we refined our planned data collection methods for the 2020 data gathering season. Covid-19 and lockdown then occurred so we adapted our methodology to allow data collection to continue by the gardeners, reporting to us via online means. Harvest and water data was collected for 2020.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2021","Having used the tool developed in 2019 as an online tool in 2020, its wider use is now possible as it is not restrained by the need for repeat physical visits by the researcher team, saving both time and money. It potentially allows for a wider sample to be included in the study and reduces the time demands on the participants who are not required to attend regular face to face meetings with the research team. Data collected is analysed and graphs with consumption and production are available to farmers on the project's website. This allows farmers to reflect on their practice and improve it. A meeting to discuss the 2019 data analysis was organised in February 2020. We will organise the second workshops at the end of March to present 2020 data analysis and compare it with the previous year.

It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments.
RO-Crate is the marriage of Research Objects with DataCrate. It aims to build on their respective strengths, but also to draw on lessons learned from those projects and similar research data packaging efforts. The RO-Crate effort brings together practitioners from very different backgrounds, and with different motivations and use-cases. Among our core target users are: a) researchers engaged with computation and data-intensive, workflow-driven analysis; b) digital repository managers and infrastructure providers; c) individual researchers looking for a straight-forward tool or how-to guide to &quot;FAIRify&quot; their data; d) data stewards supporting research projects in creating and curating datasets.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2019","RO-Crate is now widely recognised as an approach to deliver FAIR Digital Objects in a web-native way.

Springer New York","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2015","Research in the field of cortical development has benefited from technical advances in recent years, and tools are now available to label, monitor, and modulate cohorts of cerebral cortical neurons using in vivo approaches. Substantial populations of cerebral cortical neurons are generated in a specific sequence by the radial glia progenitors that line the ventricular surface during development. These radial progenitors self-renew and generate intermediate progenitors or neurons in a precisely choreographed fashion. 
in utero electroporation has become a central technique in the study of key aspects of neural development, such as progenitor proliferation, neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and circuit formation. This method has also facilitated the exploitation of cell lineage and optogenetic techniques in various species from chick to gyrencephalic higher mammals. This chapter provides a description of the method and gives some examples for its utility in the study of cerebral cortical development and evolution.","http://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-3014-2_2","56cc989fd787f1.42216374","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56cc989fd787f1.42216374&grantRef=MR%2FN026039%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/N026039/1","CEA2AF5A-F06B-4A68-83DB-8948747892D7","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","0D476B57-83D7-40C9-AC5D-EC980E83BB10"

In the microscopic model for cell wall biomechanics the interactions between chemical processes in a plant cell wall and its mechanical properties are defined on the scale of cell wall microfibrils. Using homogenisation techniques the macroscopic model for cell wall biomechanics is derived. In the microscopic model for plant tissue biomechanics we considered the chemical processes and mechanical deformations on the scale of plant cells. Then using the homogenization techniques we derived the macroscopic model for plant tissue biomechanics. This multiscale approach and analysis of the macroscopic models allow us to define the influence of microscopic interactions and heterogeneity of cell wall matrix and plant tissue on the patterns in the dynamics of chemical processes and on the macroscopic mechanical deformations of plant cell walls and tissues.

Metagenome data is all the genetic material in an environmental sample, which might comprise thousands of different species. It is challenging to obtain metagenomic data from formalin preserved samples as the formalin damages DNA in different ways. Additionally, the pathogen searched for may be in relatively small quantities compared to other species. However, with thousands of different varieties of Vibrio cholerae, with some possessing harmful virulent genes that can be passed onto other strains, genomic or metagenomic data is the only way to identify how virulent a strain is. A modified DNA extraction process has been developed in this project to improve the quantity of DNA from formalin preserved plankton samples from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey. The method combines elements of a published DNA extraction protocol for Vibrio bacteria (Vezzulli et al. 2016) with that used to extract total DNA (Stern et al. 2018) using phenol-chloroform reagent. The method is also safer as it removes the need for toxic phenol reagent. The method provided micrograms of DNA which was a requirement for the next stage. A sample was selected with high levels of DNA and previously confirmed to contain elevated levels of Vibrio cholerae DNA by real-time PCR. This samples was subjected to a whole genomic enrichment developed by project partner L. Vezzulli on CPR samples from an African river to enrich for Vibrio cholerae DNA (Vezzulli et al. 2021 submitted). This recently proved successful and the metagenome data confirmed the presence of Vibrio cholerae metagenomic fragments.","Biological samples","","","No","2020","This method provides a template for retrieving metagenomic DNA of any pathogenic microbe from archival environmental samples but only recently developed. The methodology will be published in protocols.io and in a peer-reviewed publication once the extent of genomic DNA has been assessed. Vibrio pathogens are of increasing concern and their abundance directly increases with increasing sea surface temperature, so likely to be an emerging threat. This method can be applied to retrospectively to any formalin- preserved aquatic archival sample to determine the evolution and spatio-temporal changes of environmental pathogens. As the CPR survey is the most spatially and temporally extensive oceanic plankton survey, and routinely archives it samples- the generation of metagenomic Vibrio data from a greater number of samples over time, could be used to extend our understanding of conditions that promote the development of pathogenic Vibrios. It could also be modified to widen its application to other environmental samples such as soil. The method builds on that from Vezzulli et al. (2021) in that it can obtain microbial metagnomic data from an area that likely has lower, transient quantities of the pathogen and is the second example of successful retrieval of pathogenic metagenome from formalin-preserved CPR samples. Previously, only short pieces of DNA, called PCR products, could be retrieved that could only provided limited information on the identity of a pathogen, insufficient to track the spread of virulence in the oceans.",,"60463f09288c80.72900139","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=60463f09288c80.72900139&grantRef=NE%2FS013431%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/S013431/1","8773A298-6948-4A2E-BD29-9DD287D851E4","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","309F361A-A8CC-438D-AB70-93C74E1E91C3","28E0DE41-DC70-45AA-AEBA-0AB515B29CE1"

Adherent cells are those that exist in a native state attached to surrounding tissues. When isolated from their normal environment adherent cells require an artificial substrate in order to grow and divide in vitro. Adherent cells are being explored as novel therapies for a variety of conditions as well for drug discovery as replacements for animal models to screen new compounds, or for the production of biological materials, such as enzymes, vaccines, hormones, antibodies, interferons and nucleic acids. 

Conventional methods used for manufacturing and storage of adherent cells are sub-optimal for many of the new uses, where delivery of precise quantities of viable and potent cells is often required. Microcarriers are being increasingly explored for the expansion of adherent cells as an alternative to conventional 2D tissue culture substrates. However, two interlinked stages frequently used during the manufacturing process of adherent cell products pose particular risks to the viability and potency of the product: 

The first risk occurs if there is a need for initial detachment of cells from the culture substrate, which poses a critical risk to the viability of the cells and their ultimate function. 

The second risk occurs if the cells require cryopreservation during the transfer from the manufacturer to the end user, with cryopreservation and cell thawing having an impact on cell survival. 

To address these challenges we have developed novel clinically ready, biodegradable, biocompatible synthetic microcarriers (TIPS microparticles) that eliminate the need for cell detachment before clinical delivery. Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated this approach is technically feasible and the technology is currently being translated to early stage clinical studies. 

Building on this, our pilot studies have demonstrated that cells attached to the biodegradable microcarriers are compatible with cryopreservation, with viable cells remaining attached to the microcarriers after thawing. We hypothesize that the microcarriers offer a feasible solution to mitigate the risks associated with the manufacture of adherent cell based products used in biotechnology. 

Since existing methods for seeding adherent cells onto microcarriers are unpredictable and inconsistent we have devised a novel process that involves incubating individual microcarriers with a specific quantity of cells in a droplet of liquid. To date, our pilot studies have demonstrated this approach is technically feasible but have involved the use of manual dispensing of cells and microcarriers into the hanging drop. 

To make the technology attractive for industrial applications, we hypothesize this approach could be scaled-up and automated to provide a process capable of producing large quantities of cellularized microcarriers, each with a specified quantity of cells attached to the surface.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","We are in the process of filing a patent application on the technology outlined above.",,"584718ae3674c2.76947509","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=584718ae3674c2.76947509&grantRef=MR%2FL002752%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/L002752/1","6D479BEA-F907-44BC-B74D-C40779419816","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","57019425-33E1-4859-980C-84915C6EFD81"

The method thus provides first general practical route to directly estimate all the necessary parameters of the DPD model and relate DPD parameters to specific chemical composition.","https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Science_Highlights_2017_2018.pdf","5c8259029743f6.46273164","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c8259029743f6.46273164&grantRef=EP%2FM022617%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M022617/1","6BD6DF59-41DD-4687-8FCE-46B5714D315E","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","670538DA-5B47-4CD2-940F-203E8484DB9B"

RPA is a novel isothermal technology for use in molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases. Unlike many other isothermal technologies, RPA does not require elevated or precise temperature, and proceed at temperatures between 25-40 C. The technique opens the door to extending the application of DNA amplification in fieldwork and at the point-of-care. RPA replaces the thermal cycling needed for PCR with three core enzymes. Buruli RPA has been set up as a lab in a suitcase to be used as a point of care diagnostic test.

Substantial populations of cerebral cortical neurons are generated in a specific sequence by the radial glia progenitors that line the ventricular surface during development. These radial progenitors self-renew and generate intermediate progenitors or neurons in a precisely choreographed fashion. 
in utero electroporation has become a central technique in the study of key aspects of neural development, such as progenitor proliferation, neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and circuit formation. This method has also facilitated the exploitation of cell lineage and optogenetic techniques in various species from chick to gyrencephalic higher mammals. This chapter provides a description of the method and gives some examples for its utility in the study of cerebral cortical development and evolution.","http://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-3014-2_2","56cc989fd787f1.42216374","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56cc989fd787f1.42216374&grantRef=BB%2FI021833%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/I021833/1","EA10EC80-C1D2-4A80-9F82-3A3B3C93625D","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","0D476B57-83D7-40C9-AC5D-EC980E83BB10"

The mass spectra obtained from these scan measurements provide molecular mass and structural information for eluted components, which supplement the qualitative information based on retention times obtained using other LC detectors. They also reduce the need for impurity or degradation product standards, that are often very costly, as antibiotic degradation product can be estimated by using LC-MS/MS even at very low concentrations, by developing the appropriate methods for quantification based on molecular ion peaks. 

All types of antibiotics and related degradation products of industrial waste samples including beta-lactam antibiotics, sulfonamides, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurans, chloramphenicol etc. can be analyzed simultaneously.

The approach relies on assembling all the fastq file reads, DNA short sequences output of the sequencing technology, to create longer sequences (contigs) on which all DNA sequences can be mapped and quantified. We have written several scripts that end users will be able to download from GitHub. The user will be able to run all the scripts on his own server. Whereas step 1 and 2 need to be executed on the user's server, step 3, 4, 5 and 6 have been optimized to be used on the Amazon server as they involve an interactive visualisation and screening of taxonomic and functional profiles at community and taxon level. Therefore, the user can upload the output files of step 1 and 2 and visualise the data on the web interface, programmed with Shiny and JavaScript. Below is a description of the scripts that will be available on GitHub (1,2,3,4,5, and 6) and running on the Amazon server (3,4,5 and 6):

1) script1.pl uses the bwa algorithm to map the fastq file reads from all the samples to the contigs. In the script all the parameters are already set and optimized for this kind of data, but it is possible for the user to change some of those.

2) script2.pl uses a Diamond blastx search to align all the contigs against a non-redundant protein database (UniRef100). The output file reports only proteins that aligned to a contig with bit scores higher and e-value lower than a threshold. All the parameters are pre-set but the user can change them.

3) script3.pl assigns protein coding regions to each contig. It parses the output of script2.pl and looks for non-overlapping proteins on each contig. Whenever more proteins matched the same contig region, only the protein with the highest bit score is kept.

4) script4.pl assigns taxonomy to each contig using the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) method. The LCA is determined looking at the taxon associated with each protein that has been assigned to each contig. The LCA assignment is also weighted with the bit score of each alignment.

5) Once taxon (script4.pl) and coding regions (script3.pl) have been assigned to each contig, script5.pl uses this information and the output files of script1.pl to attribute taxon and gene relative abundances to all the samples. The relative abundances are calculated in reads per kilobase (RPK) and are weighted with the proportion of mapped reads in each sample.

6) script6.pl detects SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) in different samples. The output files report synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs, amino acid and codon substitutions, deletions and insertions.","Biological samples","","","No","2018","As soon as the paper is published, this will become available to the community and impact will be then evaluated.",,"5a9e8b657b0693.78714012","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5a9e8b657b0693.78714012&grantRef=NE%2FJ02399X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/J02399X/1","73B7C5A5-5C79-4D4C-B78E-EFE924C78D59","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","8D533133-1566-4BBB-B2B5-1889F2BAB5F7"

This is due to the increasing number of vehicles that are driving on city roads of limited capacity. The vehicular congestion significantly impacts travel distance, travel time, fuel consumption and air pollution. Avoidance of traffic congestion and providing drivers with optimal paths are not trivial tasks. The key contribution of this work consists of the developed approach for dynamic calculation of optimal traffic routes. Two attributes (the average travel speed of the traffic and the roads' length) are utilized by the proposed method to find the optimal paths. The average travel speed values can be obtained from the sensors deployed in smart cities and communicated to vehicles via the Internet of Vehicles and roadside communication units. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to three other algorithms: the simulated annealing weighted sum, the simulated annealing technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution and the Dijkstra algorithm.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2016","This and related works are linked with the collaboration that we established with new partners in the area of smart cities.","https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/7/1013/htm","603bc9313034e6.58671621","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=603bc9313034e6.58671621&grantRef=EP%2FK021516%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K021516/1","A837044A-84FD-4363-978C-2223EFF24049","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","03D8AFBB-3EA5-4885-B036-BD4F9F4F9849","6D1573D0-440E-4846-AD29-1ECE3658425C"

Our idea, expressed as a specific objective in our proposal was to optimise the growth of chondroprogenitors on microbeads. Following their growth on microbeads we intended to depart from conventional methodology, which is to remove cells from the microbead carriers, and instead induce differentiation of the chondroprogenitors whilst on the beads. The beads are collagen-based and therefore provide the idealised scaffold for cartilage tissue engineering; the microcarriers are biocompatible and also biodegradable. Our innovation has been to devel;op the techniques to produce cartilage sheets made of chondroprogenitor-laden microbeads. This technology allows us to produce large sheets, limited only by the size of culture vessel. As cells are expanded on the microbeads and our data shows at optimal growth that they divide once a day, we can obtain large amounts of substrate for cartilage sheet formation within a week.

Tis subsequently became mebedded as one of the pilots for testing Natrual Englands GI standards.
Once the standadrds had been produced we produced guidance for its application and delivery. I was pleased to play a significant role in the drafting of material. 

This guidance provides support to professionals in the built environment, highways, health, and environment to deliver better Green Infrastructure (GI). Essex's Nine GI standards have been developed to support policy and development management in the planning and delivery of multifunctional GI for placemaking and placekeeping. These standards are written as a form of assessment criteria to enable policy and development management to go beyond the statutory requirements, to create great places for people and wildlife to thrive. 

The standards will help with policy and strategy writing, master-planning, design, and implementations of developments. They can be applied to GI projects and to the management and maintenance of GI. 

This document can assist in:
• the improvement of planning policy, 
• framing planning conditions for future planning applications; and 
• shaping project delivery in securing multifunctional GI in the long-term.

This document brings together existing guidance, examples of good practices and information on how to meet the GI Standards. That will be laid out in the Essex Design Guide .","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2021","The final guidance wil be pulbished shortly and as such no impacts have yet been secured althuogh testing is underway in several local plans.","https://www.dropbox.com/s/7mg42ik7u2j20u5/Essex%20GI%20Standard%20Guidance%20-%20Version%204%20%28Nov-Dec%202021%29.docx?dl=0","6228bdbfd281e2.81503676","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=6228bdbfd281e2.81503676&grantRef=NE%2FR00398X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/R00398X/1","CF842AEF-EBA2-421B-BF74-36B62DDCF0D3","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","EF390CF0-ECD3-47D8-B9A8-7602AF319BEE","CC6423BB-AF63-4F29-BDD2-3B86D967509E"

propose to revolutionise current endocrine diagnostics by replacing conventional, timeconsuming single-analyte hormone assays with ambulatory dynamic endocrine diagnostics.
Disorders of endocrine systems are not only accompanied by changes in absolute hormone
levels, but also secretion patterns. The rapid circadian (24 hour) and ultradian (&lt; 24 hour)
cycling of hormone levels poses diagnostic challenges since random measurements do not
always detect abnormalities. Furthermore, monitoring of treatment of endocrine diseases are
often severely limited by lack of multiple measurements at different time points. To overcome
these hurdles academic and commercial partners propose to validate novel dynamic endocrine
diagnostics with state-or-the-art ultrasensitive assays by liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectroscopy (LCMS/MS) and multiplex proximity extension assays .These will be able to
generate a timeline of &quot;hormonomes&quot; covering the 24 hour cycle without losing sensitivity and
specificity, producing not only hormone levels, but also secretion patterns for diagnostics and
monitoring purposes.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","No","2020","N/A",,"6046473b17e113.48577094","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=6046473b17e113.48577094&grantRef=MC_PC_18041","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MC_PC_18041","201A1753-F4B0-4578-9434-616D43073494","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","8F27F83F-F830-4172-B687-6D7C1E69BB1F"

In addition, other criteria (e.g., social) has to be taken into consideration when analyzing the PV market at the international level, particularly due to the diverse financial support policies that may be in place at this level. In the light of this, this paper presents a multi-criteria methodology to evaluate the impact of different financial support policies on the economic attractiveness of domestic PV systems from an international perspective. In order to reasonably model the complex political influences on the PV support policies and the performance of the aforementioned policies since their implementation, historical records on PV market trends in different countries are assessed in this work and are used for this study. Political influences on such policies are directly reflected by the installed PV cumulative power records. The multi-criteria analysis highlights the policies that have the most potential to encourage investments in PV systems and may facilitate sufficient investment in different countries to meet their specific environmental targets.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2015","Paper presented at the 29th European Photovoltaic Specialists Energy Conference (EU PVSEC), Amsterdam, 2014.

Development of a tool-kit of methods and activities to carry out with museums","4. We have developed a toolkit of activities to carry out with museums. These include:
i) Skills gatherings, where master basket-makers work with objects no longer made in order to renew the baskets and develop an understanding of the intangible cultural heritage embodied in the artefact.
ii) 'From plant to basket' events, where we explore the ecology of the basket as a whole, from the management of the material, to its harvesting, sorting, making and use in basketry. This gives insight to the whole life history of the artefact.
iii) How many ways to make a.? For example, a piece of string, where we consider simple twining, palming, windlassing and so on, all of which can create the same outcome.
iv) Netting bees etc. Here, extending our work with basketry-related techniques such as netting, we work in museums using techniques linked to their artefacts and local history, engaging with the public as a form of 'heritage action day'.
v) Many of these techniques are translatable or relevant for use in other areas of our research.

It is therefore vital that we can representatively sample and preserve DOM in freshwaters for subsequent analysis. Here we investigated the effect of filtration, temperature (5 and 25 &deg;C) and acidification (HCl) on the persistence of low molecular weight (MW) dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and orthophosphate in oligotrophic and eutrophic freshwater environments. Our results showed the rapid loss of isotopically-labelled glucose and amino acids from both filtered (0.22 and 0.45 µm) and unfiltered waters. We ascribe this substrate depletion in filtered samples to the activity of ultra-small (&lt; 0.45 µm) microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) present in the water. As expected, the rate of C, N and P loss was much greater at higher temperatures and was repressed by the addition of HCl. Based on our results and an evaluation of the protocols used in recently published studies, we conclude that current techniques used to sample water for low MW DOM characterisation are frequently inadequate and lack proper validation. In contrast to the high degree of analytical precision and rigorous statistical analysis of most studies, we argue that insufficient consideration is still given to the presence of ultra-small microorganisms and potential changes that can occur in the low MW fraction of DOM prior to analysis.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2017","Clarifies the role of ultra-small microorganisms in compromising sample integrity for DOM analyses prior to analysis, and recommends to other researchers a modification in sample storage in order to mitigate these impacts.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717308847?via%3Dihub","5aa8f6157985c1.94833574","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5aa8f6157985c1.94833574&grantRef=NE%2FK010689%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K010689/1","C2E859B5-8451-42A3-8ACE-B587117C3473","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","F3755C41-62CB-439D-959A-2B52F747D106"

The proposed hierarchical framework is presented as day-ahead scheduling and two-layer intra-hour adjustment systems. Two objectives, namely the operating cost minimization and tie-line power smoothing, are integrated into the framework. In the intra-hour adjustment, a master-client structure is designed. The CHP and thermostatically controlled loads are coordinated by a method with two different time scales in order to execute the schedule and handle uncertainties from the load demand and the renewable generation. To obtain the optimal set-points for the CHP, an integrated optimal power flow method is developed, which also incorporates three-phase electric power flow and natural gas flow constraints. Furthermore, based on a time priority list method, a three-phase demand response approach is proposed to dispatch thermostatically controlled loads at different phases and locations.
The developed methodology is applied to a simulated community energy system obtained from a modified IEEE 37-node system. Numerical results have shown that the proposed scheduling method can effectively reduce the operating cost while smooth the tie-power power fluctuations. It is also shown that the amount of data traffic will be significantly reduced as only the operating boundary information is transmitted. The proposed method can also be used to meet other requirements for the integrated community energy system, such as minimizing the energy loss and emissions.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","The developed management system could help to reduce energy loss and emissions for integrated community energy system.",,"56d971c1e59ca9.67068486","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56d971c1e59ca9.67068486&grantRef=EP%2FL001063%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/L001063/1","34FFD228-2F72-461E-AD54-A92D2D826225","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","EC23DA53-CA73-4104-A3F6-2A9523484E69","805BF1A0-B634-4558-BA5E-9CB38293A4AC"

Our data however after testing the Musashi promoter activity showed that Musashi activity is not restricted to intestinal stem cells. 
Then we applied similar strategy to label intestinal stem cells by bio-imaging techniques using Lgr5 (Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5) promoter fused to RFP for in vitro validation assays. Then, we cloned the 2.9kb Lgr5 proximal promoter by PCR using mouse genomic DNA and fused it to RFP for in vitro validation assays in cell culture. Our validation assays using colon cancer HCT116 and SW620 cells transfected with the Lgr5-promoter-RFP confirmed Lgr5 activity and positivity only in 1-2% of the cell population by fluorescent microscopy.
Then, we constructed the transgenic vector in which the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to IRES is controlled by a specific mouse intestinal stem cell marker, Lgr5 promoter and with conditional Cre/LoxP mediated recombination strategy; e.g. villin-Cre. We have already generated few ES cell clones using Electroporation and subsequently genome screening assays based on PCR. These ES cells clones were subjected to Lentivial transduction that express Cre-recombinase and the expression of GFP confirmed by the fluorescent microscopy.
Currently 2- ES clones have been used to generate chimera mice using the tetraploid (4N)-embryonic aggregation technique by the transgenic service facility of the University of Nottingham.","Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo","","","No","","Stem cells are a pluripotent, self-renewing cell type that give rise to differentiated cells.

Once the transgenic mouse is equipped it will in principle allow the genetic tracking of normal and/or transformed Lgr5 cells and their offspring within established normal gut and/or tumour tissues. In longer term, we would cross the Lgr5 transgenic mouse with an APC single allele mutation (ApcMin/+) and a conditional homozygous deletion of Tcf4 (Tcf?G) generated in our lab to investigate the involvement of intestinal stem cells in tumourigenesis.

Professor Pratibha L Gai and Professor Edward D Boyes, University of York

With the award of the EPSRC grant we have developed the world's first full function high performance aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). It has &lt;0.1nm resolution capability and single atom sensitivity for dynamic in-situ experiments on solid state heterogeneous catalysts for gas reaction studies and we are now moving into the application intensive phase of the project. 
Our development has created in the UK a novel and globally leading research capability providing Angstrom Analysis for dynamic in-situ reaction studies under controlled conditions of temperature and continuous gas atmosphere; rather than the usual high vacuum or pulsed gas. 
We have modified an existing AC TEM/STEM instrument to complement and extend its capabilities with gas reaction studies while maintaining, and in some aspects extending, vacuum especially, the full performance and functionality of the core tool. Our new design provides the world's first full function aberration corrected environmental scanning transmission electron microscope (AC ESTEM). The global competition (approx. 20 labs, all overseas - Europe, USA, Japan) continues to use a version of our earlier ETEM design which is in practice high resolution in TEM only and come with a single aberration corrector for TEM imaging. The old design has significant analytical and imaging limitations which make it unsuitable for multi-user environments; to the extent several laboratories have a dedicated machine (as we did with the original) and second instrument for other uses. This is expensive in both capital and operating costs as well as in real estate and support needs. With the modifications to the machine at York, ETEM is also (re-) introduced into the UK in high resolution form. Perhaps more significantly, cost-wise, the full ESTEM functionality also supports full STEM for the parallel high vacuum operations. This in itself is major advantage of the new developments which not only enable the new functionalities but also support a much wider and more intensive utilisation of the core capital kit investment in multi-use applications, as well as ensuring the substantially fixed support coats are spread over as wide a range of applications as possible.
In association with partners in the vibrant UK chemical and energy industries we are generating fundamental application science underpinning nanoparticle based solid state heterogeneous catalysis used in gas-solid reactions. Our primary industry partners are Johnson Matthey Plc.
With the award of the grant in 2012 we began construction of modifications beyond the very limited initial proof-of-principle demonstrations for gas operations on the multi-use high resolution microscope in our laboratory at York. This included a complete rebuild of the column pumping systems and replacement of the supplied pipework with new designed for purpose stainless steel pipework and fittings to full UHV standards of cleanliness. As planned, this proved to be an economical route to go; in part due to the standardisation of parts in a competitive market and because the UK retains an industry able quickly to make special pipework, also at modest cost.

The year 2013 saw the launch of our aberration corrected ESTEM as a scientifically useful capability. Further improvements to the new core capability and to support other uses of the capital kit with a minimum of compromises and crucially without the need to change the machine configuration for different applications, are continuing. For example there is a simple and rapid switch over from gas-mode to high vacuum mode with no changes to the hardware involved. For the first time we have designed and built a machine in which the gas introduction, pumping and control systems do not interfere with the conventional high vacuum performance and in some respect improve on it. 

Phase one technical developments on the microscope have been successfully completed and they have produced a first high profile application publication in Annalen der Physik in June 2013. With the developments we have made we have created at minimal expense world leading new ESTEM functionality without compromising other attributes for these and other applications on the existing high vacuum multi-user machine. 

Recent progress with the new generation of MEMS hot stages we have been able to purchase with the grant (substituting for part of the originally proposed old technology), has been transformational in what we can do scientifically, in productivity and with most of the technical support by ourselves on site rather than regular sagas of return- to-foreign-factory for service. This development makes it practical to track areas continuously over time and during temperature transits, with especial relevance to comparison data for the MC calculations; themselves not part of the project but augmenting it through studentships.

The science the new capabilities open up is exciting. It provides a key tool for the study of single atoms in catalysts under reaction conditions in a machine also able to analyse the structure of the nanoparticles. This is a novel and potentially very important development in terms of impact. As well as new information on the migration of materials from one discrete, in this case metal, nanoparticle to another; it shows the potential importance of these species as active sites themselves; out there on the support surface. This work relates to parallel on-going Monte Carlo calculations and provides important input for further calculations of functionality and specific chemical reactivity; through for example the DFT methods we used for catalytic nanoparticles (at that time studied without gas) in a 2012 Nanoletters paper.

In 2014 further technical developments on the microscope have increased the gas pressures inside the microscope (as outlined in our EPSRC grant proposal) and resulted in high profile publications in the first quarter of 2014, including in Comptes Rendu (Physique). This is also the time for ramping up the PDRA supported applications of the new kit developments. 3x PDRAs have now been appointed; all of them experienced electron microscopists with application domain science backgrounds in nanoparticle physics and chemistry for cstalysis. In this we have been most fortunate.

Support for continuing as associate partner of EPSRC SuperSTEM at Daresbury, as the in-situ component of the EPSRC National facility for aberration corrected electron microscopy. Project work with Leeds and Sheffield on this. 

There has been significant industrial collaboration leading to joint publications with Johnson Matthey Plc, a FTSE 100 company and world leader in precious metals and catalysis. JM was also a strong supporter of our grant proposal and the interaction continues to be further strengthened at the strategic and tactical levels. 
The latter include CASE studentships, access to their extensive technical resources for both specimen preparation (including custom preparation to our specifications where needed) and testing, and regular direct technical work for which they pay the University.

The first activity is a guided walk with community members (preferably women) to get a first understanding of the neighbourhood and the sanitation facilities and practices at stake. By sanitation facilities we mean the infrastructure, sites, and related service, both in the home and public, that people use to process, dispose of, and clean up faecal and menstrual waste. By sanitation hotspots we mean places where key sanitation improvements are happening and/ or places where key sanitation related challenges can be found (e.g. open defecation, dumping of waste, overflowing pits, exposure of sanitation users to risk/ harassment, flooding). Data is recorded with GPS/spatializing applications (eg. RamblR), photos, notes, short videos and sound clips. 
. The second method consists in building the history of the community and of sanitation. This is a collective activity, starting with the enumeration of participants, and then the recalling of major events, and further of sanitation events, prompting participation along different features/identities (tenants/landlords, women/men, young/old, facilities/emptying/disposal/menstruation). The third method consists of focus group discussions on taboos and sensitive issues related to sanitation. Participants are divided by gender and report on key taboos, their causes, and consequences, as well as the options for those who cannot respect the taboos and must contradict them. This is followed by a collective discussion where groups report back. The fourth method is a mapping activity, where participants locate their dwellings, their sanitation facilities, and the hotspots (good or bad) of concern to them. This is discussed collectively. The fifth method is designed to facilitate a collective discussion of official bylaws and social and community norms (including traditional and market-based norms) that together structure the everyday governance of sanitation in all studied cities. Participants first identify these norms and assess their enforcement, the sanctions for breaking the laws/rules and if they are applied or not. In turn, this method allows for an excavation of the taboos underpinning urban sanitation and also of their function (e.g.: protection or discrimination). Together these methods enable a reframed collective and intersectional conversations observations on the governance, practices and experiences of urban sanitation in a respectful way, one which values the agency and investments of community members, while pointing to the diversity of experiences and practices and the differentiated impacts , weight, and opportunities, of different sanitation constellations.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2022","This method was piloted in Mwanza (Tanzania), refined in Freetown (Sierra Leone) and adapted to Beira (Mozambique) and it is currently being applied to three selected sites in each city.

o In summary, LIPS detects PPR specific antibodies theoretically across a wide range of hosts including wildlife and can be operational alternative gold standard test. 

o The LIPS have analytical sensitivity and specificity of greater than 95% but its implementation should be accompanied by validation and verification across a panel of samples from different PPR lineages.

o The strength of the LIPS lies in its robust systems in which you can manipulate the type and the length of the target protein of interest and can be used for mass screening similar to ELISA. 
 
o Technical problems including cross neutralization and cross reactivity with morbilli virus are overcome by using specific epitopes and thus might be useful in the final stages towards PPR eradication programme. 

o At present, the standardisation of cut off across species vs per species in LIPS remains to be done 

o A substantial number of negative sera against the background of both typical and untypical hosts is a current constraint.


o Furthermore, the effect of having a full length protein on the specificity versus, a more refined or defined fragment of the protein required further exploration.

o In LIPS, so far most efforts have been invested in testing full length of PPR lineage 4 from Tanzanian samples missing crucial components of other PPR lineages and thus more representative samples from other regions will be sensible for the extrapolation of the results. 

o The use of the full length of PPR lineage 4, might increase the sensitivity, but not the specificity and true infection is the desired outcome for PPR eradication programme.

The ability to take an ERT system and use it to determine the real time movement of the freshwater / saltwater interface within an acquire is highly significant and has been achieved by the team at our field site.

DnaB-AID was found to increase 2.5 &times; 103 fold relative to the mutagenesis frequency of wildtype. 97.9% of these edits were observed on the leading strand during DNA replication suggesting deamination to be highly coordinated with DNA replication. Using DnaB-AID, a 371.4% increase in ß-carotene production was obtained following four rounds of editing.

Using MCM5-AID, the average editing efficiency of five strains was 2.1 &plusmn; 0.4 &times; 103 fold higher than the native genomic mutation rate. MCM5-AID was able to improve ß-carotene production of S. cerevisiae 4742crt by 75.4% following eight rounds of editing.

Second generation biofuel production is one such process. HTP screening allows the investigation of large sample sets to be undertaken with increased speed and cost effectiveness. This paper outlines a methodology that will enable solid lignocellulosic substrates to be hydrolyzed and fermented at a 96-well plate scale, facilitating HTP screening of ethanol production, whilst maintaining repeatability similar to that achieved at a larger scale.

The results showed that utilizing sheets of biomass of consistent density (handbills), for paper, and slurries of pretreated biomass that could be pipetted allowed standardized and accurate transfers to 96-well plates to be achieved (&plusmn;3.1 and 1.7%, respectively). Processing these substrates by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) at various volumes showed no significant difference on final ethanol yields, either at standard shake flask (200 mL), universal bottle (10 mL) or 96-well plate (1 mL) scales. Substrate concentrations of up to 10% (w/v) were trialled successfully for SSFs at 1 mL volume. The methodology was successfully tested by showing the effects of steam explosion pretreatment on both oilseed rape and wheat straws.

This methodology could be used to replace large shake flask reactions with comparatively fast 96-well plate SSF assays allowing for HTP experimentation. Additionally this method is compatible with a number of standardized assay techniques such as simple colorimetric, High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Furthermore this research has practical uses in the biorefining of biomass substrates for second generation biofuels and novel biobased chemicals by allowing HTP SSF screening, which should allow selected samples to be scaled up or studied in more detail.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2015","Not known","https://biotechnologyforbiofuels.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13068-014-0181-z","5a86a90d429602.28530299","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5a86a90d429602.28530299&grantRef=BBS%2FE%2FF%2F00044476","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BBS/E/F/00044476","5D64B9E2-D3DF-4813-A22A-1E6ED3ED2636","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2D8E82C0-85D1-4809-90FC-4716F4AF5865","7F3EA362-AEB4-49B6-A7B1-C1BB02373585"

Participants are asked to observe actions. At some point, the body part carrying out the action (e.g. the hand) disappears, and participants have to judge where they have last seen it, by pointing on a touch screen. This method is a significant advance to the other method described here. It is highly usable even by participants that struggle with the relative difficult first paradigm (such as children, participants with an autism spectrum disorder). 

As before, the results reveal a perceptual distortion: participants report the hand to have travelled further than it actually has, in line with the idea that perception itself is not a veridical representation of reality, but includes a prediction of what will happen in the future. Importantly, we were able to show that this prediction is affected by the participants' knowledge of the environmental constraints.. For example, actions are distorted away from an obstacle if it blocks the way, or towards a straighter path towards a goal if there is no obstacle.. This paradigm can therefore reveal (a) not only that predictive processes do take place in social perception, but (b) that these processes are not only stimulus-driven by directly influenced by high level information about the other person's goals, and (c) with reference to the current environmental constraints.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","Yes","2015","This procedure is not published yet, but we have demonstrated our novel procedure in talks and posters at conferences, and at invited talks at other universities.

Destructive sampling is increasingly difficult to obtain for ethical reasons, and standard methods of breaking the skull to access the petrous bone or sampling remaining teeth are often forbidden for curatorial reasons. However, most ancient humans carried head lice and their eggs abound in historical hair specimens. Here we show that host DNA is protected by the cement that glues head lice nits to the hair of ancient Argentinian mummies, 1,500-2,000 years old. The genetic affinities deciphered from genome-wide analyses of this DNA inform that this population migrated from north-west Amazonia to the Andes of central-west Argentina; a result confirmed using the mitochondria of the host lice. The cement preserves ancient environmental DNA of the skin, including the earliest recorded case of Merkel cell polyomavirus. We found that the percentage of human DNA obtained from nit cement equals human DNA obtained from the tooth, yield 2-fold compared with a petrous bone, and 4-fold to a bloodmeal of adult lice a millennium younger. In metric studies of sheaths, the length of the cement negatively correlates with the age of the specimens, whereas hair linear distance between nit and scalp informs about the environmental conditions at the time before death. Ectoparasitic lice sheaths can offer an alternative, nondestructive source of high-quality ancient DNA from a variety of host taxa where bones and teeth are not available and reveal complementary details of their history.","Biological samples","","","Yes","2022","Published just weeks ago, too early.

This tool relies on the FCLP database: Household crime victimisation survey. We developed new models which integrates a range of street-level characteristics (for example, socioeconomic deprivation and business activities etc.). We created models which uses the study area's street layout and configuration to predict levels of accessibility and permeability for every single road and street segment that exists in the study area. The above information, in turn, were integrated in a statistical model to quantify their risks associated with property crime that occurred on streets. The integration of the above techniques enabled us to also generate risk maps that show which street segments has the lowest or greatest burden of property crime.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2018","Most of the research on environmental criminology focusses on data collected from cities in the Global North and analysed from a Western intellectual perspective.

The physical mechanism underpinning the effect is deemed to be entropy changes arising from changes in the relative alignment of microscopic dipoles. However, there is little direct evidence of the correlation between heating/cooling and the associated microstructural changes that are responsible. Hence, we have been developing a technique that allows us to measure electrocaloric temperature changes with sub-micron resolution using an Atomic Force Microscopy technique known as Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). SThM enables local mapping of temperature distributions by using a very sharp temperature probe which enables sub-micron spatial resolution and order of 10mK temperature resolution. The tip monitors induced temperature changes at a given point on the surface while an electric field is cycled on and off. Once the measurement is complete, the tip moves to a neighbouring location and the field cycling and temperature recording process is repeated. Iterating this process across the surface allows 2D maps of electrocaloric heating and cooling to be extracted with sub-micron spatial resolution.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2022","The technique has not yet been reported to the wider community.

• Awarded Wellcome Trust funds (2018-2021), as collaborative project with the University of Cambridge's InterMine team to link the two resources and reward researchers for annotating and publish FAIR data; also, ISA is embedded in two ELIXIR Implementation Studies, on a Plant-focused data validation and on metabolomics. 
• With the uptake of ISA-Galaxy tools (https://github.com/ISA-tools/isatools-galaxy) and integration with the Galaxy Framework, ISA has struck a major milestone by showcasing how prospective data management can be done, demonstrating a full deposition workflow to Metabolights and creating training material (10.7490/f1000research.1115757.1). 
• Jupyter notebooks (https://github.com/ISA-tools/dtp-isa-exercises) have been developed as teaching material to showcase the use of ISA-API in various context to undergraduate and postgraduate courses on data readiness.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","Community use and impact is tracked via the ISA Commons, which currently has over 40 international groups, projects, and organizations that use and contribute to the development of components of the ISA metadata tracking framework. Therefore, we can say that the ISA user base ranges from hundreds to thousands of researchers from increasingly diverse domains (ranging from -omics, cell-based research, biomedical nanotechnology, plant phenotyping, toxicology, biodiversity, metagenomics, stem cell research, system biology, neuroscience, microbial science and immunology), and goes beyond researchers, curators, others resource developers and service providers, to also include journals. For example, ISA is used by the University of Oxford' GigaScience and underpins Springer Nature's Scientific Data data journal, supporting intelligent data sharing and credit; ISA is used to describe the experiment and to provide browse and search functionality for Scientific Data's content (http://scientificdata.isa-explorer.org). 
The ISA framework is currently embedded in a number of UK, EC and NIH and pharma funded infrastructure and research projects; here are exemplars from the ELIXIR UK Node and other Nodes: 
o EMBL-EBI MetaboLights' new web-based submission relies on ISA-JSON format to build web component and on the ISA-API to validate, convert experiments represented in ISA objects.
o BBSRC-funded COPO infrastructure relies on the ISA API, ISA-JSON serialization and on the ISA configurations to support plant-based experiment molecular profiling experiments; it also used the ISAconverter to deposit to the ENA database.
o ELIXIR-UK Node partners, University of Birmingham and Imperial College London use ISA Galaxy Tools, ISA-API and ISA validator - as part of their work in the UK Phenome Centre - to collect data prospectively but also organise public deposition to repositories.
o ELIXIR Plant Community's MIAPPE standards and BrAPI rely on availability of ISA parsers and validation tools in the context of data validation programs.","http://isa-tools.org","5c86b6f06e5a26.75760505","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c86b6f06e5a26.75760505&grantRef=BB%2FL005069%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/L005069/1","1374F2DE-7552-4DC8-A593-0DA9E6427580","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","8F8C28F1-22C4-4E4D-935B-A431D732F5B8"

In order to enable a deeper understanding of these complex signalling networks we have developed a bioinformatic pipeline that enables the simultaneous consideration of several regulatory layers, at the whole-cell scale. Using the Hfq transcriptional/translational regulatory network in the model bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens as a test case, we used extensive 'omic-analyses to assess how hfq deletion affects mRNA abundance, translation and protein abundance. The subsequent, multi-level integration of these datasets enabled us to highlight discrete contributions by Hfq to gene regulation at different regulatory levels.

1) Smart-seq2 for single cell RNA-seq
This method is currently being translated into the genomics pipelines group, to be offered as a service through NC1. It enables sequencing library preparation from single-cells sorted into 96-well plates, with a transition to 384-well plates envisioned in the coming year. Through automation and volume reduction we have introduced ~10 fold reduction in library preparation costs. 
2) Single cell whole genome amplification by multiple displacement amplification
We have optimised Qiagen's single cell whole genome amplifcation kit to work at 1/4 volumes, allowing whole genome amplification for approximately &pound;4 per cell. This work has been supported by a TRDF awarded to Neil Hall and Iain Macaulay.
3) Single cell multi-omics approaches, including G&amp;T-seq
We have established G&amp;T-seq at EI and are currently developing it further to translate it to 384 well plates, enabling further cost savings and broadening applicability to include pollen sequenencing and environmental single-cell sequencing. 
4) Flourescence Activated Cell Sorting
At the foundation of all of this, we have established a cell sorting capability at EI - the only one in Norwich with the capability for single-cell sorting - and have worked up protocols for gut and bone marrow stem cell isolation, bacterial sorting and sorting from environmental samples. We currently support a number of research programmes across the NRP with cell sorting.

Short description of the developments and achievements of the resource over the last year:
• Awarded Wellcome Trust funds (2018-2021), as collaborative project with the University of Cambridge's InterMine team to link the two resources and reward researchers for annotating and publish FAIR data; also, ISA is embedded in two ELIXIR Implementation Studies, on a Plant-focused data validation and on metabolomics. 
• With the uptake of ISA-Galaxy tools (https://github.com/ISA-tools/isatools-galaxy) and integration with the Galaxy Framework, ISA has struck a major milestone by showcasing how prospective data management can be done, demonstrating a full deposition workflow to Metabolights and creating training material (10.7490/f1000research.1115757.1). 
• Jupyter notebooks (https://github.com/ISA-tools/dtp-isa-exercises) have been developed as teaching material to showcase the use of ISA-API in various context to undergraduate and postgraduate courses on data readiness.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","Community use and impact is tracked via the ISA Commons, which currently has over 40 international groups, projects, and organizations that use and contribute to the development of components of the ISA metadata tracking framework. Therefore, we can say that the ISA user base ranges from hundreds to thousands of researchers from increasingly diverse domains (ranging from -omics, cell-based research, biomedical nanotechnology, plant phenotyping, toxicology, biodiversity, metagenomics, stem cell research, system biology, neuroscience, microbial science and immunology), and goes beyond researchers, curators, others resource developers and service providers, to also include journals. For example, ISA is used by the University of Oxford' GigaScience and underpins Springer Nature's Scientific Data data journal, supporting intelligent data sharing and credit; ISA is used to describe the experiment and to provide browse and search functionality for Scientific Data's content (http://scientificdata.isa-explorer.org). 
The ISA framework is currently embedded in a number of UK, EC and NIH and pharma funded infrastructure and research projects; here are exemplars from the ELIXIR UK Node and other Nodes: 
o EMBL-EBI MetaboLights' new web-based submission relies on ISA-JSON format to build web component and on the ISA-API to validate, convert experiments represented in ISA objects.
o BBSRC-funded COPO infrastructure relies on the ISA API, ISA-JSON serialization and on the ISA configurations to support plant-based experiment molecular profiling experiments; it also used the ISAconverter to deposit to the ENA database.
o ELIXIR-UK Node partners, University of Birmingham and Imperial College London use ISA Galaxy Tools, ISA-API and ISA validator - as part of their work in the UK Phenome Centre - to collect data prospectively but also organise public deposition to repositories.
o ELIXIR Plant Community's MIAPPE standards and BrAPI rely on availability of ISA parsers and validation tools in the context of data validation programs.","http://isa-tools.org","5c86b6f06e5a26.75760505","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c86b6f06e5a26.75760505&grantRef=BB%2FL005050%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/L005050/1","D669FCC1-292C-4A98-9B11-D58D76A16B29","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","2E6EDFEF-507F-4350-B2D1-281D8B669378"

Validation of this new technology is already achieved in laboratory exposed and mussels collected from the field (Sfrozini et al, 2018, The Science of the Total Environment 628-629, 319-328). 
New immunohistochemical methods using specific antibodies have been developed to study the accumulation and the distribution of B[a]P and C60 in mussel tissues. Changes in actin/tubulin cytoskeleton were also analysed. The role of mTOR in the regulation of the autophagic process stimulated by environmental contaminants was demonstrated and proposed as new biomarker of stress (Sfrozini et al., 2018 Aquatic Toxicology 195, 114-128).","Model of mechanisms or symptoms - non-mammalian in vivo","","","Yes","2014","This new platform is now considered as robust and reliable transcriptomic tool for the analysis of mussel's gene expression regulation. The platform could be further implemented with newly identified molecular targets in mussels. Moreover, the new platform can be used for routine biomonitoring analysis thus offering a rapid and relatively low cost tool. This technology has now been implemented by us in the field situation along with other classical biomarkers 
The use of an immunohistochemical approach will allow identifying minimal amounts of PAHs and fullerene in the tissues of molluscs and other organisms. mTOR was found to be a valuable stress biomarker also in field biomonitoring and therefore it should be used in the future as a powerful indicator of the effects of environmental contaminants on mussel physiology. mTOR results will help to realise new studies on the autophagic process and more, in general, on the control of the physiological status of the molluscs.

The assessment of material efficiency is based on the objectives of using less material processing to produce a unit product, to improve production yield, and to reduce the environmental impact of material processing. The framework uses a combined quantitative and qualitative approach to give structure to the investigation of complex systems, with the aim of uncovering innovative opportunities for improvement. The framework consists of five distinct phases: 1) production system scope, 2) material flow inventory, 3) material flow assessment, 4) improvement scenario modeling, and 5) interpretation. These phases are largely interdependent, with phases 1-4 following a largely sequential but potentially iterative progression.

It enables sequencing library preparation from single-cells sorted into 96-well plates, with a transition to 384-well plates envisioned in the coming year. Through automation and volume reduction we have introduced ~10 fold reduction in library preparation costs. 
2) Single cell whole genome amplification by multiple displacement amplification
We have optimised Qiagen's single cell whole genome amplifcation kit to work at 1/4 volumes, allowing whole genome amplification for approximately &pound;4 per cell. This work has been supported by a TRDF awarded to Neil Hall and Iain Macaulay.
3) Single cell multi-omics approaches, including G&amp;T-seq
We have established G&amp;T-seq at EI and are currently developing it further to translate it to 384 well plates, enabling further cost savings and broadening applicability to include pollen sequenencing and environmental single-cell sequencing. 
4) Flourescence Activated Cell Sorting
At the foundation of all of this, we have established a cell sorting capability at EI - the only one in Norwich with the capability for single-cell sorting - and have worked up protocols for gut and bone marrow stem cell isolation, bacterial sorting and sorting from environmental samples. We currently support a number of research programmes across the NRP with cell sorting.

When information on protein sequences was not available, a protein prediction algorithm was run on sequences in order to derive this information. Additionally, the mycobacterium M fortuitum was sequenced using Illumina technology, and we were provided with the unpublished and incomplete genome sequence of M parascrofulaceum.","Database/Collection of Data/Biological Samples","","","No","","The construction of this database has allowed us to define multiple proteins which are present in common non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), but which are absent from M tuberculosis (Mtb) and other members of the Mtb family. We hope that this will allow us to define T cell responses which are specific to NTM, indicating exposure to these mycobacteria. We have gone on to select proteins which are predicted to be secreted or cell-surface associated, so are more likely to represent T cell antigens. We will next test their ability to predict exposure to NTM, first in a mouse model and then in humans who are known to have been exposed or who are naive to exposure to NTM. If successful, this will allow us to quantitate exposure to environmental mycobacteria in the context of trials of new TB vaccines, and to establish whether this exposure has an effect on the immunogenicity of these vaccines. This will also be a very useful resource for the field of bovine immunology, where exposure to NTM is thought to be of critical importance in the immunogenicity of novel TB vaccines, and is also important in the use of diagnostic reagents.",,"E7E144A0BFC","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=E7E144A0BFC&grantRef=G0701309","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=G0701309","DEF46B10-8D25-4C9F-8ED3-566FA1E12562","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3EAE04CA-9D62-4483-B9C4-F91AD9F4C5A9","236677B5-BD5F-44C6-B1AA-3E05E7458A7B"

The software is used to calculate a variety of different properties from protein amino acid sequence and/or protein structural data. Properties calculated for sequences include: amino acid compositions; combinations of charges to give net predicted charge, fraction charged, predicted isoelectic point, ratio of conservative amino acids; propensity for disorder; and ß-strand/sheet forming propensity. These properties are calculated as averages over the entire sequence and as minimal/maximal values in windows of 21 and 51 amino acids along the sequence. For structures and structural models, properties calculated include: patch non-polarity, calculated as non-polar solvent accessible surface area (SASA) divided by polar SASA, size distribution of charged patches (positive and negative, including the largest patches) from Finite Difference Poisson Boltzmann (FDPB) calculations; average contact order for heavy atoms in the protein, relating to the degree of close packing as an empirical proxy for structural stability. Charge patches are dependent on ionic strength and pH, features that are also part of FDPB calculations, which allows us to account for ionic strength and/or pH effects on solubility.

The analysis outputs include virtue continuum mapping and a video series plus other media to form a story line linked to an existing virtual community (Stilwell). We have also produce a decision making briefing and debriefing tools and resources. The aim is to allow personalised ethical debate in medical schools, junior doctor peer groups or with experienced doctor peer groups to build phronesis that is relevant to the medical leadership and ethical decision making in their particular contexts and specialties.

To date little research has explored the ways in which phronesis is cultivated over a period of time within one professional community. Conroy et al (2012) did this for a health and social care community including the medical community but there is an absence of research with medical professionals to explore how they have accumulated and enacted phronesis within their daily practice. Questions have rarely been asked as to how professionals are equipped morally (or otherwise) to navigate a chaotic world of practice rife with competing demands and relationships. To date, many researchers within medicine (e.g. Kaldjian 2014, Montgomery 2006) have made the case for a reorientation towards phronesis in medical education, but little has been undertaken to explore what that might look like.

Existing studies have tended to capture practical wisdom within one snapshot, within one organisation or by following one practitioner. We have followed three communities of doctors over three time periods: beginning of formal medical study; on placement at the end of formal study; and established medical professionals with 5 years plus qualified experience. This design (Conroy et al 2015) will offer an opportunity to see how phronesis develops over time whilst enabling a varied discussion about how moral resources are accessed and what the role of formal education is in equipping practitioners for the messy and subjective realities of practice.

By exploring how doctors at different points in their careers have access to or draw upon moral resources, the study gathered narratives about how they make 'good' decisions for the patient at hand; balancing care, compassion, quality, resources, capacity, medical outcomes and the wider well-being of the community. The added artistic element is that we gathered a collection of the participants narratives to creatively shape an original 'soap opera' style video series that connects to an existing virtual community of health and social care practitioners, patients and the public. That fictional virtual community is known as Stilwell (city suburb) with all the health and social care issues associated with a typical town in the UK. 

The methodology used is applicable to other sectors and disciplines such as care, education, law and business and therefore the research promises much wider benefits. 
This entry has three main sections. First it begins with an explanation of the methodology, second, the research design and methods are described in detail and then the entry ends with conclusions that explain the potential contribution to the field and the potential implications for policy and practice as well as suggested further research.

Methodology
The methodology is capable of answering the following research questions:

1. What does phronesis (pratical wisdom) mean to medical students and practitioners?
2. To what extent is phronesis cultivated, maintained and moulded over the educational and practice life of doctors in the UK?
3. To what extent can phronesis be promoted through educational and practice interventions?

Secondary questions:

a. What does an empirical study of phronesis within the medical context tell us about theoretical debates in virtue ethics?
b. Do understandings and enactments of phronesis change through medical education, and if yes how? 
c. How much room do doctors in the UK have for exhibiting phronesis in their professional practice?
d. Does phronesis play a role in sustaining the community's trust in the medical profession?
e. Are there enabling factors (e.g. presence of role models) and/or competing forces (e.g. marketization or bureaucratization) that influence the extent to which doctors can exhibit phronesis in professional practice? 
 
Conroy et al (2012) used MacIntyre's (1981) practice based community theory of virtue ethics including the virtue of Phronesis to present a mapping of virtue continuums for a health and social care community. The virtue continuums mapped were based on the stories told by the participants and showed where on the continuums each story was positioned hence the claimed Phronesis. What was clear from the last workshop with the community was how useful it was to the community to be able to see the virtue continuums presented and where the stories indicated decision points on the continuums. Their response to seeing this depiction of Phronesis was typically 'I realise now I need to move in x direction with y virtue continuum to make a better decision' (p9) In other words they were using the constructed picture of virtue continuums to help them improve their decision making based on their understanding of their own practice. This is very different to giving health and social care practitioners a set of ethical guidelines i.e. deontological principles to work to. Many writers on this subject e.g. Dawson (2010) have argued against the approach of using such ethical principles as they do not take into account the many different contextual variables of each ethical dilemma.

What is missing from studies to date is a fully contextualised depiction of stories about decision making and how they relate to all the professionals involved. Dawson (2010) additionally argues against deontological guidelines arising from quantitative or qualitative based research that do not acknowledge the uncertainty in the research evidence. Conroy (2010) acknowledges this issue in qualitative studies using narrative accounts and argues for a social constructionist based narrative approach as an ethical way to approach leadership and virtue ethics research and change with practitioners. In other words stories told by practitioners to a researcher may or may not be accounts of what actually happened, however, they do offer a window into the socially constructed nature of ethics and intersubjective reality of decision making in the professional community they practice. The arts based development to the methodology described here offers an ethical approach to the research by constructing a video series that depicts a virtual medical community making decisions, again based on the stories as in Conroy et al (2012) but also themes and a serial with episodes as demonstrated in Conroy (2010) and Czarniawska (1997) that shows the characters developing in their Phronesis due to certain events and therefore for them, how and why particular decisions have been taken. This arts based addition to the presentation of findings is novel in that although the virtual community (Stilwell 2016) has been used before to help substitute for placements (Walshe 2009) and as a leadership development resource (Conroy and Corrie 2014) it has not been used for the specific purpose of showing the socially constructed virtues and Phronesis informed decision making. We argue that this methodological approach leads to a useful resource for doctors in pre-clinical undergraduate education and post clinical/graduate training as well as offering a CPD resource for experienced doctors. This innovation in the methodology means that research can bridge the gap (Smith 2016) between research and practice in an ethical way that could have a very positive impact on the medical community and impact positively on the public perception of that community.

As we have seen above, an overall narrative approach to the nature of virtue (including phronesis) has been crucial to this project. In order to answer questions 1 and 2, we collected narratives of phronesis in action from medical students and doctors as well as narratives of the development of phronesis. We collected these narratives by conducting interviews, by observing medical students and doctors at work and by asking some of them to keep a narrative diary. We approached question 3 by involving the medical community in the co-production of a video series that uses dramatized stories to illustrate phronesis and its development in the medical context. In keeping with the narrative approach it is our contention that phronesis can also be best communicated and developed through narratives. For this part of the project we used a similar approach to that used by the Stillwell Multi-Media Virtual Community (Stilwell 2016) developed by the University of Cumbria. 

Methodological approach in detail
The methods were designed to collect narratives, diaries and observations about phronesis from medical students and doctors at various stages of their careers in the United Kingdom. Three main forms of data collection were used in the first phase of the study: e-portfolio notes, interviews and ethnographic observations. Interviews were semi-structured and developed from story gathering methods developed in Conroy et al (2012). Observations used an overt non-participant approach and all field notes were taken as unobtrusively as possible. Some of the study participants were asked to bring or later send their e-portfolio reflections of important. All interview, observation and e-portfolio notes were entered into NVivo10 with confidentiality protected. 
Interviews 
Semi-structured interviews lasting roughly 45 -60minutes have been held with 131 participants from all four cohorts and are used as the primary form of data collection in the study. The interviews were lightly-structured at first starting by explaining that we are interested in exploring the participant's experience of making ethical decisions whether these be their own or others they work with. Also whether they perceived them to be good or not good decisions. Participants were allowed to start discussion of the topic wherever and however they want. If they did not respond to this then the interviewer might say 'It seems hard for you to start on this subject, would you like to start with the difficulty?' We then asked them about instances or stories that they allude to in the difficulty. If the interviewee presented facts or offers general accounts they were invited to give specific examples relating to their account. Experience from previous studies (e.g. Conroy 2010) show that for most interviews explanation of the research aims and active listening signals are an excellent means of generating stories. The secondary research questions (framed in relation to their accounts) informed the structure for the second part of the interview to gain clarification of context, the characters involved, dilemmas, competing pressures, community response, etc. Participants were asked to recount stories of the following sorts: 
• where they felt they have applied their own practical wisdom to a work situation
• where they felt they could have acted more wisely 
• where they had seen a colleague making a particularly wise decision 
• where they had seen a colleague making a particularly unwise decision 
• whether they know of any particularly wise or unwise decisions that they have not experienced directly, but that have influenced them in their thinking 
• what they think the characteristics are of wise or unwise decisions in medicine. 

Observations 
Observations of individual participants from the four cohorts were undertaken during the fieldwork. Observing participants also provided context to the participants' development of phronesis (if it occurs), as well as their interviews and e-portfolios, which was important when developing the video series. A selection of experienced practitioners were observed in the multidisciplinary team meetings that many attend on a weekly basis. 
Participant kept diaries - e-portfolios 
Originally we were going to ask our participants to keep diaries about any ethical decisions they experience but we later established that some keep e-portfolios where they record their experiences and reflections. These are self-reflexive and can be used to provide context and reflections for decisions the diarist makes, or decisions they see others making in practice. The participants were asked to send e-portfolios to the researchers. Only a few e-portfolios were collected and entered into NVivo. 
Analysis 

The initial social science-based analysis was used as a way to reveal themes and extract stories and a serial for the arts-based analysis. The thematic (social science) analysis element used a Framework Approach (Ritchie et al 2010) to yield themes or categories of what doctors find important, typologies of people and events and medical workers' behaviour. Virtue Continuum coding was conducted in NVivo 11. The end goal was to consolidate a set of virtues contained in the data that could be used as the basis of the video series and the theoretical analysis. The nature of phronesis was examined through two theoretical lenses: MacIntyre's (1981) virtue ethics and Kaldjian's (2010) medical phronesis. Virtue ethics provides a virtues-goods-practices-institution schema (Moore and Beadle 2006) which comprises a number of theoretical concepts relating to phronesis: 
• Virtues: disposition to act in a certain way that enables us to achieve internal goods (includes wisdom) 
• Internal goods: the excellence of products/services and the perfection of the individual in the process. 
• External goods: only contingently attached to a practice e.g. money, status and power Practice: any coherent and complex form of social activity e.g. medicine, nursing, social work etc. 
• Institutions: primarily concerned with producing and distributing external goods
• Narrative quest: search for our purpose (telos) toward wellbeing (eudaimonia) 
• Communal narrative quest: arising from a meshing of practice virtues and a telos of collective wellbeing. 
The Medical Phronesis lens held alongside virtue ethics helped us to contextualise the notion of phronesis. According to Kaldjian (2010: 559), phronesis in the context of medicine encompasses: 
• Pursuit of worthwhile ends 
• Accurate perception of concrete circumstances 
• Commitment to moral principles and virtues
• Deliberation that integrates ends, concrete circumstances and moral principles or virtues 
• Motivation to act in order to achieve the conclusions reached by such deliberation. 
 
An initial output of the analyses has been a virtue continuum mapping of 15 virtues to illustrate phronesis enactment across all the data. The next stage was the virtual community media production. The media includes a video series, blogs, social media, newspaper pages etc. to create a whole teaching package. The process of moving from data and analysis to the video series was a co-production between the creative director, the research team, participant representatives and a consultant and GP. Initially a series of workshops were convened to map out the story boards and characters for the video serial and to link to characters within the wider Stilwell virtual community (http://www.stilwelleducation.com) Once the story boards were agreed the creative director arranged for a script to be written for each video episode based on our findings (15 virtue continuums and the narratives from our participants relating to each virtue) The scripts was reviewed by cohort representatives, the researchers and medical educators from each of the partnering institutions. Ethical dilemmas are presented in each episode and provide focus for each episode. These will be related to a session within a series of blocks in a medical training programme module. For example a first theme might be 'From Pillar to Post' showing the competing pressures as described above and the potential for impressionable and unstable positions taken by a fledgling doctor. Second might be 'A Purposeful Stand' showing a doctor gaining clarity of purpose and deciding where they stand in relation to the competing pressures, ideologies and practical dilemmas. Third might be 'Maintaining an Ethical Stance' showing how that stance plays out in a number of different interactions with other doctors, nursing staff, patients, family, social services etc. and how in practice that stance might not always produce the desired outcomes for patients. These examples show that many different themes and storylines that were explored in a serial format with the same characters to enable medical student reflection and debate on the concept and practice of phronesis. Once the scripts were agreed the film production team, who are well versed in Stilwell productions, co-produced the videos using professional actors and advice from cohort representatives, a consultant and the researchers. 

Conclusion 
The methodology described here is capable of providing an artistic presentation of the issues of phronesis in a medical community or any practice based community for that matter. The video series 'soap opera' and the way it links to the existing virtual community will be debated with a broad audience of academics, practitioners, patients and policy makers and others with an interest in the field at our final workshop. The video series will offer an innovative, edgy complement to the many text based recommendations that have emanated from scandal enquiry reports and social science based studies to date. New understandings of the cultivation of phronesis in medical communities and its role in rebuilding public trust in the light of many scandals will be of interest to healthcare researchers, educators, practitioners and policymakers. The aim is to impact on the medical and professional education of doctors as a community, building stronger links between the medical community and the public and rebuilding public confidence in the medical profession. MacIntyre (1981, 2009) argues that moral debating resources are missing from ethical education and the wider theological and philosophical context of any practice. We argue here that the methodological approach and the resultant outputs offer the education and training of doctors a moral debating resource in the form of virtue continuum mapping and the added resource of a video series plus other media to form a virtual community presentation and the possibility of a decision making resource to aide in-action decision making and after- action reviews of decision making.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","Two of the most most notable impact examples are first, interest from the UK Merchant Banking sector and an offer has been made to the PI to meet Merchant Banking advisors. The idea proposed is to use a similar methodological approach (research, film production and moral debate resource) tailored for their use. Their ethical decision-making is associated with multinational corporations and high net worth individuals and has considerable international impact. Typical decisions involve international financing, underwriting, real estate, trade finance, foreign investment, consultation on trades and trading technology. The second example, a senior advisor to the UK government's Department for International Development (DfID) who reviewed the resources on the project website thought their non-prescriptive nature means they are more likely to be embraced and used by DfID members. This has the potential to improve ethical decision-making to impact on the well-being of people in the countries supported by DfID. These include Somalia, Nigeria, South Sudan, Congo, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Rohingya. The advisor has already discussed the use of the resources with the DfID members. He said 'This looks really interesting and I am sure that [UK government cabinet minister] would go for this. His bookincludes a lot about this type of knowledge that he says is missing' The DfID connection will progress with the co-authoring of a paper (with the advisor taking a lead) tailored to the interests of the members and then presented at one of their meetings. 

A great deal of national and international interest has been shown in the methodology and the PI, Dr Mervyn Conroy, has been approached by academics from the UK and US who have asked him to share the methodology so they can replicate the study with medics and nurse in healthcare institutions connected to their universities. The methodology is defined in the final report but will also be a journal publication that will be published later this year.","http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/social-policy/departments/health-services-management-centre/research/projects/2015/phronesis-and-the-medical-community.aspx","58c0647b3d8753.22568682","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c0647b3d8753.22568682&grantRef=AH%2FS000763%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/S000763/1","C25C7A55-A882-4A27-ADE7-1B579700BE01","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","32F4C0BC-6B69-46C2-B2B5-30D1D271D977"

In our recent paper, we have described that just minutes after in vivo challenge of mice, 'typically-extracellular' bacteria efficiently replicate in tissue macrophages (Ercoli Nature Microbiology 2018). Subsequently, we have realised that once bacteria have been delivered in vivo to splenic tissue macrophages, the organs can be collected, sliced and cultured ex vivo in the laboratory. In these tissue slices - which conserve the 3D microarchitecture - we observe that bacteria continue to replicate within the macrophages (unpublished). The availability from a single infected organ to prepare approximately forty slices in which bacteria are rapidly replicating within cells, and which can be conveniently incubated in flat bottomed micro-titre plates, prompted us to attempt to exploit this tool for within-tissue susceptibility testing.
Our unpublished data show that a 6-hour incubation of the tissue slices in the presence of serial dilutions of antibiotic allows for detection of bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of the drugs in question. The format of the method is comparable to a classical microbroth dilution assay, with the exception that one infected organ slice (obtained 30 minutes after in vivo challenge) is incubated in each microtitre well. Antimicrobial drugs are then added as in standard susceptibility testing and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBC/MFC) are detected by bacterial colony counting. After six hours of incubation bacterial enumeration allows determination of growth, inhibition and bactericidal activity of a drug. Our pilot data show that pharmacokinetic drug penetration ratios correlate well with the experimental intra-extra-cellular drug efficacy ratios determined by our method on a model strain.","Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo","","","Yes","2019","An outline grant on the use of organotypic slice as an antimicrobial drug activity testing method during the phases of hit characterisation and hit to lead development.

What do you think made this collaboration work?
• Adrian Mulholland (AM): 
o The 'right people' ie people that are:
? Able to speak for their discipline and are open to others
? Able to (or learned to?) translate from one discipline to another
? Open to collaboration
? Interested in developing ideas
o Clear scientific area, AMR, which was recognised politically and scientifically as being really important so people cared about it; people wanted to make a difference.
o Attitude of the team that managed it- people that became involved in the projects had (or adopted?) the same ethos
 
• Matthew Avison (MA):
o We had good fun and we got on well, we still do.
o We didn't have too many egos in the room [AM:Just me. MA:We massage it every now and again]
o When we had meetings we amicably came to decisions.
o I wanted it to work because of self- interest (in AMR)- it keeps us (in AMR) all going
 
• Annela Seddon (AS):
o Within the management team- people were interested in the success of the project as a whole, rather than the individual successes that it might bring. 
o Leaders advocated for the project rather than themselves
o People were really willing to raise up other people because that was important for them rather than it always being about them.
 
• MA:
o It wasn't about suppressing egos for the common good, the management team just didn't have that big egos anyway- and they've shown in other things that they've done that it is generally about the common good (values)
o It helped that we just kind of got on with it
o It might have been a bit of luck at the time but if I went back and did it again they would always be the people I would choose.
 
• Katy Turner (KT)
o Maybe the people that agreed to it maybe were willing to kind of...
• MA
o And that may be true, there may be an element of self-selection.
• AM:
o Team was deliberately not the highest profile Professor in every department, it was people who were interested in learning
o AMR could be a part of advancing all of our careers
o Not saintliness but an openness to learn and I knew that people were willing to learn
• MA:
o Apart from you (Adrian), all of us were senior lecturer at that point, we've all moved on at least one rung since then so it has helped all of our careers.
 
• Jim Spencer(JS)
o I wonder if the fact that we made it clear at the beginning that the funding was available for anyone to bid for, it wasn't, from the point of view of people from outside of the applicant team. I think we succeeded in making it clear that there was something in it for them, that the pot of money we had applied for wasn't going to be carved up between ourselves.
o Any perception that we were a closed shop and I think we succeeded in making clear really early on that this something that was inclusive and that anybody could bring an idea and they had as good a chance as anybody else in Bristol and getting some money
• AM:
o That was important and the other thing that was important was that within the management group we had a structure that was intended to demonstrate that it was collaborative. We were divided into themes and every theme embodied bringing someone from the EPS side and someone from the biomedical side.
o So every theme had joint leadership and those people that led the themes were joint leads
o That embodied what we wanted to see through the project
o Seed funding proposals had to be collaborative- they had to bring people together from different domains.
o Strong thrust on these should be new collaborations
 
• Rob Hughes (RH)
o Something that was really obvious coming from an external perspective coming into it was how inclusive everyone was and how quickly and effectively they would wrap you in, everything you needed to know, they would get you trained in the areas that you needed, it didn't feel like there were any boundaries to where you could go, who you could go and talk to, what kind of techniques and tools you could use or learn. And that was, at that stage of career that I was, invaluable. It exposed me to a huge wealth of other things, and other fantastic people.
o Initially AS was my main point of contact as I quiveringly went up and spoke to her at a conference. I saw a presentation that Annela had spoken at and I thought there was some sort of connection there, so I spoke to her and she immediately leapt on it and gave me lots of time to talk to her about it and develop the idea and then introduced me to JS and other people as well, to continue that and within a few months I found yself in a biology lab being trained how to stain bacteria, and I had never done anything like that since 6th form!
o And so I was plunged into this world but there was a lot of positive and optimistic responsibility given to me and so, them trusting me that I would be able to pick it up as I went and not worrying that I was going to, not understand things straight away, just giving me the time to build those skills and knowledge was really helpful for me, not having any knowledge of that really.
• AS:
o I just remember a hilarious phone call from RH at about 11pm in Thailand, I sent Rob over to Thailand to collect water samples and apply all of the techniques that we were developing in the lab and to see if he could get them to work in real samples. Rob had been in the lab since 8 in the morning and it was 11 at night and you were like &quot;I've done a thousand agar plates today&quot; and only a few months ago you were an engineer! You've probably plated out more samples in a day than most people do in their PhD. It was brilliant!
• RH:
o I was on someone's grant as a PostDoc in the Engineering department.
o They were very supportive, of expanding your horizons and things like that, they paused the work that I was doing at various points so that I could work on these projects.
 
• MA:
o Coming back to the point about &quot;allowing you to...&quot; the reason why I think we could do that we didn't feel under any pressure to make the individual projects succeed, it was about making the collaboration and the network building succeed and so the individual projects, many of them did really, really well, but actually we could be a bit risky and thats one of the benefits of this type of funding.
• KT:
o And it wasn't loads and loads of money. It was short, defined projects, and we spread them around and there was that feeling that- it is risky to do this, lets see what we can get out of it.
• AM:
o There was much less worry about the outcomes of the projects, more about getting the spending done as it was quite a short project (2 years).
o You had to identify someone like Rob whose supervisor was prepared for them to move off a project or be seconded or something and didn't get a job in the meantime
o So various things we could have funded didn't happen because someone moved away or something else happened
o So the practicalities.
 
• MA: 
o It was a flexible pot.
o Claire did a huge amount of work just to make the finance work, HR, some of the contracts
• AS
o And getting visas sorted out
• Claire Spreadbury (CS)
o It's not easy to do that, across the university.
• AM:
o And that wasn't envisaged in the application, that came up because we got some additional GCRF funding, can you arrange visas for 20 people from Thailand!
• MA:
o A large part of the success of the project is that we got Claire in, we got someone who can manage multiple tasks, from organising a conference to organising a visa
o They are very different skills and we were very fortunate (and thats why we're trying to keep her :-))
o If we hadn't had someone like that we may not have been successful.
o CS can remember everybody's names and what everybody does, and she's like that with the students she remembers exactly what they're doing, she remembers them all and she has many skills but that's one of the important things when you are building a network, just remembering who people are is one of the most important parts of it!
• CS:
o You get good oversight because you've got the paperwork in front of you, its more tangible.
• AM:
o It's a lot of people, a huge number of people that you've dealt with.
• CS:
o I know a lot of people in the AMR world, now, across the country!
 
Serendipity vs deliberate?
• Bringing people together is important 
o E.g. Mervyn Miles meeting someone in a lunch queue at a conference that sparked a project
o Making the space for luck to happen
o Events are really important for that
• MA:
o Academics are generally quite good at bumping into each other and finding things that are interesting- reasonable common ground
o But what we could do with BristolBridge is that we could put some &pound;s in front of it and say &quot;well there's a reason for you to actually do this&quot;, and once people saw projects funded and the university were very supportive of the project in terms of advertising its successes and seeing management attending some of our events and then the wider university sees it as a success and then they become more likely to become involved.
o And its funny now like the money has kind of gone, that actually we very much worry about it kind of falling apart a little bit.
• AM:
o And people retreating into their silos
• DH:
o Now with no &pound; we have no avenue for it really
• AS:
o Its funny I had a conversation soon after we launched we did an event, a workshop, we had a series of flash talks, and a very senior academic who I won't name came over and said , &quot;I don't know why you are bothering with these piddling little bits of money, you should just take a big tranche of money and give it to one or two people to solve the problem.&quot;
o And I thought You. Don't. Get. This. Like, you don't understand the role of what we are trying to do, you don't understand the riskiness of these short term projects, you don't understand the collaboration.
o Because their point of view was, &quot;I'm the best in my field. You should give the money to me, and I will make all of this go away and it will all be fine.&quot; And I thought &quot;but you haven't done it so far so what makes you think if we gave you the money now you would be able to, that it would be any different?&quot;
o And that attitude, kind of, I was quite taken aback by that. I wanted to say (but I couldn't, I was too scared), &quot;look around this room, can you not see the conversations that are happening and the things that are coming out of this, do you not recognise the value in that?&quot; And I thought well if you don't, then maybe this isn't something you should be involved in. 
o And that person never got involved in anything. And never turned up again, never engaged. And never applied.
• AM
o Its a very different sort of funding. Much of science funding is, you know, a slogging, long long process of getting funding, a lot about reputation and facing down referees and all the rest of it. This is a very, very different model of funding. 
o It wasn't a lottery, it was competitive.
o But it was, &quot;you've got a good idea, well, OK, we can probably give you money within a few weeks to begin with and take it from there.&quot; And lots of things came out of that.
o And I think thats a model of funding that lots of universities and Research Councils could usefully use. 
o And then because its not really worth the mega beasts going after this, &pound;20k, they're not interested, but for someone else, its going to change their career.
• AS
o That &pound;20k could lead to a slightly bigger pot of money and then you start to look at the -O-Star project which was about &pound;3million- something like that?
• MA
o The Thailand- O Dart? One? 
• AS
o Yes that one it grew and grew and it was like a snowball
• MA
o It was KT doing a bit of work and people coming together and a bit of GCRF investment from the university and CS working hard and BristolBridge and it all came together and we got to that point.
o And there's been other examples of success and Rob may well have got himself a lectureship anyway, but now he's got himself a lectureship with that bit of knowledge of AMR, that bit of knowledge of microbiology and now going forward in his career he's going to be always thinking &quot;oh, maybe there's something we can do in that area&quot; that is as much, as far as I'm concerned (given he's got another 50 years before he is allowed to retire), that's a really good outcome just a much as a &pound;3million grant.
• LO
o Importance of intangible- this is the effect that this project has had on me, and this is what I have been able to do. Social value of the collaboration. 
• DH
o About 3 different pump priming projects working with 3 different people who were some involved with the initial Bristol Bridge- some have come on board, some have dropped away a bit, you know.
o The initial project was I went to one of the initial world cafe events and I sat down on a table on my own saying I'd like to talk about Gonhorrea and I thought that I would spend the afternoon and I would have a nice day out and I'd have a cup of tea and a bun and that would be me! But actually lots of people were interested and I met lots of people with really cool technologies that you think , wow, I wonder how I could use that and so I had a sort of half idea in mind but it really consolidated and I think there were twelve people on the initial application.
o And we got really nice principle data that enabled more funding elsewhere and thats led to confidence in concept award ultimately from MRC, which is now moving forward which is really good.
o Different members of the team have come and gone as its gone on. 
o KT is the only other person at the university who loves Gonhorrea as much as I do...
o We've got now a joint PhD student, co-funded by GSK vaccines and maybe more to come. Building quite a nice nucleus around Gonhorrea expertise in Bristol. 
o With Charlotte (Birmingham) and the company we've got one of the prototype microscopes now that we're going to apply that technology to the problem so again that's an ongoing, and I'm a molecular microbiologist but its been re-engineered (and thats the extent of my knowledge still about engineering!) but to make a heater stage so thats lots of cross disciplinary stuff happening
o And we're working with synthetic chemists as part of the CiC award, so there's still lots of clusters and Shaun, who I met through Merv(yn Miles) - a physicist, we've now got a PhD student on atomic force microscopy as well looking at the surface of bacteria and these are all direct results of a cup of tea and a bun and a chat.
• CS
o Scones, actually, a cream tea.
• AM
o We spent quite a lot of time choosing the catering actually
• CS
o It is important- you want to run a good event so people want to come to the next one
• DH
o Compared to other events, and I've been to a few different things, over the years, because I've been in Bristol quite a while, and what struck me are, what Adrian said, not only the people, first and foremost, but also the set-up in terms of the space, and the tangible hook that there might be some money that you could apply for, but with so many meetings you sit there and there is talk after talk after talk and they overrun and then you get coffee and then you get &quot;we're only going to have 10 minutes for coffee&quot; and then its back into more talks and then everyone goes away.
o Having the space to sit with people from other disciplines and be creative, was what led to that initial application.
• AM
o We had never done World Cafes before, but we'd defined them in the proposal, we'd said, we'll do that.
o I'd never run a world cafe and you do, you have to be quite strict with people to let them be free form in their thinking and by giving short talks, it meant moving people around tables, it meant telling people you can't sit next to your friend from your own department you need to sit next to someone else. Anf that took a bit of prodding but it was worth it.
• CS
o It was quite nice the way we had a GP and a secondary care physician and a vet lay out the problem of AMR from their perspective.
o For all the Engineers and the Physical Scientists in the room, they just explained what the problem was as far as they were concerned, and that allowed people to really focus on their needs. 
• MA
o The world cafes were incredibly successful and the key in DH's case, Gomhorrea is a massive problem and yet its a relatively simple problem in many ways, and so you kind of capture the audience with that. And then you use their technology.
o So DH's acts as a nucleus to all of that collaboration. At the time, DH didn't have big funding pots or other things so he had time to think and be reactive in that way but also he's the sort of personality that we've talked about who is prepared to talk to people, ask questions and get involved in a social way as well.
o Actually, that experience has made me collaborate with other people differently. Because I know how I reacted in that situation to those people so now when I'm collaborating with the medics who I work with a lot, I now use them to tell me the problem. I never used to do that before. And I feel that that's kind of what the microbiologists and the AMR experts in BristolBridge were doing, we were telling them the problem, thinking they're the ones with the massive brains and they'll come up with a solution. Now I'm constantly hounding clinicians saying &quot;Tell me the problem, I want to solve a real problem&quot;. 
o Now I hope that that makes my grant applications better, my impact in my research more significant, because this is not just something I'm vaguely interested in, some esoteric thing, but something that's relevant to an application.
o Yes it has changed the way I do research, the way I look at collaboration.
 
• LO
o Space the leadership of this project gave you to explore? How important is the leadership in setting the culture?
o Like the idea of the co-investigators around themes?
• KT
o I think AM was really clear right from the beginning that it was collaboration and I think he said &quot;no stupid questions&quot;, he probably said that 50 times
• MA
o Yes that was the motto of BristolBridge
• KT
o It became a bit of a mantra
• AM
o I tried to ask some fairly simple questions, I learned a lot from this project and I tried to make clear that I would ask questions that I felt other people might think were stupid, they were quite basic but they were honest questions. So you know, I am the leader of this but I am prepared to ask simple question and prepared to make myself perhaps look silly but I am more interested in the answer.
• KT
o And that genuine curiosity about understanding
o We all felt that we were in, none of us were experts in all of the different areas
• AM
o We were all out of our comfort zone
• MA
o We all learned so much, the last 3 years I've learned more than in the rest of my... We've all learned so much and thats party the joy of it.
o But we were all kind of equal in our ignorance, lets face it!
o Thats the point, thats where the ego thing comes in as well.
o The other thing is I think it was tacitly frowned upon for us as a management committee to corner all of the funding as well. Alright we were involved in quite a lot of the projects, because we were kind of the nucleus for a lot of it but it was kind of like &quot;yeah guys I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable because Mulholland has got 17 of these projects funded and you know...&quot; but it may be that that helped it to be broader and bring people in and that was slightly tacit but still a leadership decision to do that.
• JS:
o I think it goes very early that, MA and AM, you did a really good job made it very clear at the application stage that if we were going to make an application it was going to be run on a decent basis. The university when the call was announced they went down their standard route for how they would deal with all other calls where there is a limit to the number of applications, 1 per institution, and they asked people for EoIs with the idea of making it competitive amongst ourselves and it was down to AM, once we'd had some conversations about who might put something together it was very clear that it was going to be inclusive
o You know not everybody took an interest in the final application but there were a lot of people across the university that were aware that this was going on at the application stage and that they would be mentioned during the application where it was hoped that they would participate so right from the word go it was set up as something that would be visibly inclusive.
• AS
o Although AM was the PI (name above the door), within the meetings that we had it never felt like AM was dictating to us what we shoudl be doing or how things should be run. It was very very collaborative, very equal, it was a flat management structure in a way. What was really nice was that there was always, we always kept coming back to the same thing which was, &quot;We're going to organise a World Cafe. What do we want the outcome to be?&quot; And CS kept us really honest with that. Always asking &quot;whats the purpose of what we're doing? Why are we doing it? What should our outcome be?&quot;- constantly challenging us, reminding us that it's great to have a meeting, it's great to have a workshop, but you actually have to have it for a purpose.
• AM
o Every one of our events had a purpose. A distinct purpose.
• AS
o Absolutely. And I think that was instigated by you (AM), very much hit home by CS in the organisation and how she challenged us in the organisation of it, but then brought together by the rest of the team so it felt like a really, it felt like the structure worked in order to make that happen.
o It was good leadership, and brilliant facilitation, it sort of all fell into place after that although at the time it probably felt a lot harder than I'm making it sound!
o We didn't agree on everything and we'd go round and round on certain things, and go &quot;what is the point of this?&quot; 
• AM
o We were flying by the seat of our pants....
• KT
o We were saying like &quot;we're going to have 2 hours for discussion&quot; and we were like &quot;what do you mean? You know we are going to have 5min talks and then we are going to make people talk to each other and then what if it doesn't work???&quot;
o It was pretty scary actually we were like, what if nobody's going to come, but once you've done the first one... 
• CS
o The AM/MA double act is quite engaging....
o No question is too stupid was really helpful
• AM
o No question is too stupid is my motto
• MA
o Adrian's too stupid is my motto!
o The VC came, he did a really nice, we kind of rolled him in and that was good because then people think &quot;ooo, this is and area of strategic importance and therefore I'm going to get along&quot;
• CS
o And Nishan (PVC-R) came as well
• AM
o For what was not a really huge grant either.
• MA
o But boy has it borne fruit for them. You know, now its one of the top 3 priorities for GW4, so its really gone a long way.
• AM
o I think we are able to say that BristolBridge aligned with the ethos of the university so Bristol likes to see itself as an interdisciplinary university, we are not enormous but what we re is quite strong across the board so we were able to say, we've got a big EPSRC portfolio, a good Medical School, we've got a dental school, a vetinary school and we've got microbiology etc. And we are quite good (relatively speaking) at talking to each other. So it was kind of Bristol is, relatively speaking a kind of friendly academic environment and a fairly collaborative environment. And I think that message chimed at high levels of the university.
 
Places/venues- choice?
• CS
o Good to get people away from campus
• AM
o Off campus and into something that was not a university setting where you couldn't just go back to your office and do your email 
• AM
o 2 at the zoo, Engineers' House
o Also different scales of events- so the themes did their own events, smaller than the whole BristolBridge, so a bit like cells, designed to have sub-units and layers
• MA
o Yes it was budget driven too wasn't it- the strand areas tended to do them within the university.
• DH?
o Every event was very different or felt very different, as well, so there was never any opportunity for you to get comfortable, you know if you expect the same thing every time then that stifles certain things but because every one was different even with people you'd met before you interacted in slightly different way and I think that helped because it kept people constantly on their toes.
• MA
o I think it helped having people from different disciplines on the management committee because different disciplines have their own specific way of doing things and so if you've got...the input of &quot;we did one of these&quot; and &quot;we did one of these&quot;, it helped us think outside the box a bit. 
o Most of those events it was all down to CS and CS's prior experience of managing these sorts of things. Cs is always down to the catering because she used to run a pub so she knows about these things and I think that helps, and as someone said &quot;if you go in and you give them a nice cream tea, they will think &quot;oh well we're going to go to another one of those events because they are good&quot;.&quot;
• AM
o Its everything, you've got to have a clear structure, a clear goal and within that structure the people have the freedom to be creative and if you didn't have that structure people wouldn't have had that freedom.
• CS
o You've got to have a hook, you've got to have a reason for someone to go, and I could see how it should move through in terms of an event. 
• AS
o That first world cafe we were sat there- like- what are we going to do, we all know what the concept of a world cafe is but we need to make it actually valuable, whatever we produce at the end of it has got to count, so one of the activities was we gave people the application form after they'd had their chance to network with each other and said &quot;write your proposal&quot; and we gave them half an hour to just write a proposal.
o And actually, that forcing people to go &quot;oh- this isn't just a chat, I've got to come up with a thing at the end of it&quot; was brilliant.
o And a few of the things that came out of that got funded, but it was the - OK, now you've had your chat, now the work starts. Here's the application form, if you want the money, this is what you're going to have to fill in.
• KT
o And the deadline was like a week away
• AS
o Yes so, you might as well do it now. And people were in the same room together and they really threw themselves into it.
o I remember because we discussed what we were going to do and we were like &quot;why don't we just get them to write their application?&quot; and we were all like &quot;yes that's great!&quot; and secretly I'm thinking &quot;God almighty!&quot;, I was thinking &quot;how would I feel if someone made me write an application on spec?&quot; but actually people just went with it, it was brilliant.
• RH
o Yes it was very much out of your comfort zone! Because you thought literally you were sitting down for a bit of a discussion and then we would go away and have a think about it and then I thought- I'm giving a talk on this in 15 minutes time!
o Yes because there were pitches.
• AS
o And I remember [Sarah] doing one and me going &quot;WOW, thats really amazing&quot;
• AM
o The York BtG took that to an extreme, most of their funding was for ideas that were put forward at a cafe, and they had to come directly from that; I didnt want to go to that extreme, I was slightly formed by an EPSRC experience at an Advanced Fellows event. 
o The fellows were far too disparate (and maybe too drunk) to come up with anything coherent, but that idea of maybe you can write an application in half an hour and if the idea is interesting, it might fly, and then we will develop it. 
o And it turned out to be effective.
• KT
o You didn't have to submit it that day
• MA
o A few people will have drifted away and maybe never come back again, we didn't necessarily know everybody anyway so we didn't miss them, frankly.
• AM
o The idea wasn't that everybody in the whole university would suddenly do AMR, the idea was to deliver 12-20 projects
• MA
o If a few people didnt really engage with the process we would still get something done given the numbers of people involved
• KT
o Most people stayed actually
• MA
o There were a couple of areas where there was a bit of negativity. There were a few &quot;oh, its the AMR people&quot;- they've created their little enclave and we're not part of it and there were a few people who did feel that they weren't part of it but actually they never came to any of the events either; and then there was a few people that kept submitting applications that weren't quite / nowhere near what we wanted, and that may have led to some internal frictions- I don't know because I didn't know them personally- I don't know if that caused any problems for colleagues?
• AM
o There were a few... The hardest thing probably was dealing with unsuccessful applicants, CS had to deal with some of that but in the end what we said was &quot;CS is simply the messenger so If there is a problem bring it to me&quot;. And I did have a few dissatisfied people. But mostly, the applications weren't for a huge amount of money so Ok, if you spent a few days writing an applications for &pound;20k and you haven't got it, sorry but we can't fund everything. Many of them we went back to and said &quot;this is the feedback, this is what was lacking.&quot;
• MA/AS
o We did try really hard to give feedback, how to change things
o Some people listened and really came back with brilliant things
o And some people were repeat offenders- you would keep giving them the feedback and they would keep coming back with something that was a tiny bit different, and then eventually, you would have to go, well if you're not prepared to change it..
• AM
o Thats your hobby horse, we are not going to fund it, it doesn't fit
o Often, it was because its not AMR, they are trying to cram something into AMR thats not really an AMR thing.
• MA
o We had a lot of interest from people outside EPS communities, and it was difficult managing that and being inclusive given the grant
o Some of the interactions caused a few issues in terms of focus. Bristol AMR has expanded it further and we still suffer from some of those problems, but nonetheless
o The thing we didnt do as well was the industrial engagement side- we did put industry events on and we have spun out one company and there is another company that was spun out that ius involved so we have had some successes in that area , but I felt that personally, that was the weakest part in what we did.
• AM
o The mechanisms that we had were not really well set up to stimulate that. We did spend time cultivating an industrial partner who then pulled all their funding for AMR
• JS
o It did spawn one project where we had a student together and then now we have an EPSRC grant together
• KT
o Maybe its just a bit more of a slow burn
• AM
o The projects were more likely to be entrepreneurial scale up projects in the end and a company isn't going to be interested in 3 months of post doc usually
o As you say we had the industry day and we got interest there are lots of people that want to associate with AMR in industry but there are not a lot of industrial partners, there is not really big pharma in AMR any more, and the things we were doing- is there industrial value in chlorohexadrine nanoparticle gel- well probably there is but thats really- from the ground up to define theres a market
o And we spent most of our time on procedural stuff- how do you get the money spent, how do you recruit people, dealing with visas and so on.
o Running the admin on multiple projects with one person to run it was a huge admin effort really
• DH
o From my perspective the way you did it was the best way to do it and if you then brought in industry partners at that initial stage and then you got tied up with NDAs and contracts and material transfer etc, probably nothing would have happened, nothing would have nucleated.
o From the project I was involved in which was very early stage discussions to now a CiC grant the next step is would be- if this is successful to engage with industry. And theres already been a spin-out. So that is going to happen, naturally.
o But the remit that you guys set out to establish cross disciplinary collaborations where the focus was on AMR was a huge success looking at it from the outside in.
• MA
o It would be interesting to know whether Massimo moved down the spin out route through conversations he had at the industry days or whether he did it off his own bat.
o I thought we might give people the skills to take it forward themselves...
• Charlotte Birmingham (CB)
o I don't think it was the intention at the beginning
o I think it was more that he always wanted it to have an application, he was quite focussed on the application of it
o But I don't think it was the plan to have a spin out, the project was very much that he had built this microscope and we hadn't really found the killer application for it and the project allowed us to throw some bacteria at it and see what happened, basically.
o So, there wasn't an expectation at that point that here would be a spin out coming from it but then we got talking to, probably through events relating to Bristol Bridge, I can't remember, but talking to the commercialisation people in Physics, and talking to people who had that link and that led to a CiC grant which is commercialisation based.
o So I think the contents right.
• MA
o MRC CiCs in Bristol are managed by the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute and I think through BristolBridge we did well at interacting with the other research institutes within the university; we did a joint thing with Data Science, the JGI on AMR, and we did EBI, and now EBI with Wellcome Institutional Support, pay for Bristol AMR to exist, so we did link quite well with other interdisciplinary institutes
• CS
o Actually what really helped was that JGI and the PBI stuff was CS going to RED (Research and Enterprise Development) going to their meetings as like an 'honourary person' as Bristol Bridge was onbiously trying to get grants funded across EPS and Life Sciences, and just CS being in the room and everyone in the room being aware of what BristolBridge was about and AMR, so that the arts and humanities research development managers and the life sciences and the EPSRC, they all got to know about BristolBridge, like everyone knew about it and what we were trying to do. SO having Patti Holley there from JGI and people from all the other research institutes were there and that really helped (my note- also Patti Holley used to manage another big interdisciplinary EPSRC Centre in Bristol so she knew EPSRC and HT and what we were trying to do too.)
o We were very well known within the university
• LO
o And very well known for what you were doing
• CS
o And then you can start having joint workshops
• MA
o And leveraging a bit of their funding to help joint events
• LO
o And so you get the ball rolling and it gathers as the ball
• MA
o Yes and we put AMR on the agenda for the University and they thought- Aha! 
• AM
o Became involved in steering committee for Bristol Challenges because of AMR
• CS
o And with Helen Lambert as well it all just nucleated quite
• LO
o That happened because of linkages, you all brought your networks
• AM
o Just looking back at our original objectives I think Bristol Bridge what it achieved was interesting because what it achieved was closer to the case for support than almost ALL grant applications that I've ever been involved in!
o It actually did what we said we would do! SO we had 3 objectives, 
? To develop and facilitate a wide range of networking activities to build new interdisciplinary research communities, focussing on the EPS community and the current and future AMR challenge
? To fund pump priming projects across 3 different and distinct strands building on EPS research strengths and aligned with the AMR strategy
? To fund training activities to help EPS research to understand AMR and to equip biomedical researchers to apply EPS methods to training a new generation of researchers.
o Those were our objectives and I think we actually met them and we met them in the way that we said we would meet them.
o We did pay lip service to industry but it was really lip service
o And it was remerkably close to what we said we would do, but we had a good idea of what we wanted to do in the first Place
• CS
o We did have - who was that chap who was based in Chemisty and he did a lot of work with... He went to work with InnovateUK?
• AM
o Colin?
• CS
o And unfortunately we lost him but he did help
• AM
o SO that was how we had the Redx thing
• MA
o It was pretty good wasn't it really- it was pretty good!
 
• LO
o It strikes me the importance of clarity in a collaboration like this, it was very clear what you were trying to do and its easy to be part of that and driving it forward when you've got that clarity in objectives and outcomes from whatever networking events you choose to use.
• AB
o Extent to which BB contributes to REF?
• MA
o Do you know if Vitamica is going in as its not quite ready? It isn't there yet but its not quite there yet- maybe next REF
• AS
o It will feature as part of the environment statement for Physics around Interdisciplinarity and how Physics works with other departments and this will feature its this kind of types of activities that BB did that will go into the environment case study
• KT
o Vet school plan to have AMR but likely to be more around policy and AMR in agriculture
• MA
o But we are hoping to get a bit of credit there because we did do a little bit of stuff there
o And by building the interdisciplinary community we've allowed other interdisciplinary consortia to build in their own right.
• KT
o Arguably a large part of what is going on now was facilitated by BB but there were things going on separately as well?
• MA
o Maybe one of mine might have come from BB/would not have happened without BB
• AM
o Because of the way REF is set up it has a tendency to iniquitous consequences, excluding minority groups, because its so heavily reliant on publications, the first paper coming out of BB probably didn't come out until 2016 so its a bit early for them to demonstrate impact.

o But its a slow burner, you know, we're hoping that there will be some more, we have some exciting things coming along and we are feeding into other applications for translation of technologies
o Thats another thing- it has allowed that better interaction through people like KT, being ambassadors in certain areas, to the data science, to the healthcare science, and I'm talking to people now that I would never, ever have met at all if it wasn't for BB
o And now we're going to potentially be developing clinical applications, and actually, the future is bright and there will be a lot of fall off on that but some of us will make it through if REF still exists..
• AM
o The group was not only the right people but it was consciously a diverse group, we struggle with ethnic diversity in our academic body generally, 
o But we were scientifically diverse, diverse in background, diverse in gender, diverse in personality type...
o Miserable yorkshiremen, 
• MA
o Stuck up Mancuians...
• AM
o Actually we did, as a management team, take that into consideration when we were thinking about who we were going to ask to speak at our events
o We were very upfront about this
o We all generally believed about the best science coming from different viewpoints and that means different backgrounds and different life experiences.
• AS
o Coming to BB advisory meetings were one of the very few university meetings I actually looked forward to, that I also felt like when we were considering matters of diversity it come from a very natural, bottom up discussion and it wasn't a chore.
o We talked over lunch about shared values, and this was one of the shared values we naturally have which was that we all believed that diversity was important and it was almost inherent in how we worked.
 
Advice for others?
• AS
o Pick the right people and the right people aren't always going to be super famous professor X or Y
o Its actually pick the right people for the job because one of the other things that I think made this work was that everybody put in the legwork. Nobody was too important
• AM
o That is true. Everybody worked really hard
• AS
o Everybody worked hard and we never sat round and thought so and so is not pulling their weight
o Thats not the same for every collaboration that I've been in, and I know that I've sometimes been that person who hasn't pulled their weight
o Definitely picking the right people
o The shared values thing I'd go back to again and again, making sure you have the same shared core values
• KT
o We all had quite clear roles as well, you felt, you were a representative and so you had a responsibility not just for yourself but to turn up and take Bristol Bridge back to wherever.
• LO
o Importance of this tribe and somebody being able to come and take and translate back to their tribe
o Interlocking networking stuff. Neat way of working
• MA
o I find I have not patience anymore where people don't pull their weight and are always asking for more money- they always want their bit of money or they always want their, you know. I've stopped engaging with that
o And its because we were all relatively junior and prepared to do it, and maybe had a bit more time and it just kind of worked!
o Partly luck, partly judgement but it worked.
o I run a national integration project that NERC fund, they deliberately make you fight against each other to get the funding and then they say oh we are going to give you a bit of extra funding so you can all be nice to each other. Its impossible!
o We just got the funding for an Argentina call and they've done the same thing
• LO
o It doesn't work because its actually contra to collaboration
• MA
o Exactly!
 
BB one of 11 BtG awards- did that work, was it useful?
• AM
o On the whole not that useful
• AS 
o I didn't come away feeling like I had learned anything useful- other than reinforcing my views about the way we were doing it being the right way and that we were having a lot more fun than everybody else!
o Genuinely
• LO
o The energy here is amazing
• AS
o Quite a lot of bitching/complaining at those meetings
o It was like the polar opposite of the experience of BB which was challenging and positive and fun and not without complexity
o Always a couple of great people where you share values but also people that you don't
o Reason nothing came out of that was that there wasn't that set of shared values
• AM
o They had different values and different structures
o Quite good links with Imperial (EMBRACE), one of PDRs exchanged and a joint application.
o There is an assumption that they are all the same and they just weren't at all.
o DH sitting next to John Crosby and you could actually see the collaboration happening like &quot; so you want to join those molecules together and we could do that by using Click Chemistry&quot; and it sort of clicked!
 
What would you like to tell an incoming PVC-R about this?
• AM
o There are things for the university to learn
o The AMR community in Bristol has done well from a number of activities one of which was BB, and we have an ongoing strong AMR community.
o There are a number of things the university could have learned from this and I'm not sure it has happened, 
o This model could be applied at different scales, doesn't need to be a big scale, very effectively, you could do it with other small pots of funding.
o Some of the people within the university still embody it but its a bit frustrating its not been acted upon
o Disappointed that the RCs didn't do a bit more- 2 years of funding has paid off enormously
• AS
o Uni had a good opportunity, because we do brand ourselves as an interdisciplinary environment in Bristol- they ahd a good opportunity to understand how the back room processes that support research needed to adapt for us to truly be an interdisciplinary university
o And what it never did was even when we fed back things like contracts and finance and all of these things that CS took a huge burden of, every single one of us at some point had to engage with, and they were getting the same message from a number of different people over a very short time period and they nodded and smiled and then did nothing about it.
o That was immensely frustrating and I still see the legacy of that now, I run an interdisciplinary CDT that spans 4 faculties and I am still having the same conversations I was having 9 years ago about how students transfer and where the money goes.
o BB was a small prject with relatively small pots of money that should have been, should have been easy, almost like because some of the pots of money were so small it wasn't worth their time to actually deal with it.
o OK, &pound;5k, &pound;10k, &pound;15k might not mean much to the university's budget - probably what you find down the back of the VC's sofa, but to a short project like the stuff that we did, that &pound;15k was everything. And there is not always an appreciation from the higher echelons of the university, while they are always very supportive of the work, that the kind of scale of money that they are used to working with is something that we are never going to concern ourselves with because we are never going to be working with &pound;350M, but they've kind of forgotten that &pound;15k matters and &pound;15k can make or break somebody's career.
• LO
o I really think you are so right, I don't think a lot of VCs really understand the power of small, pump priming seedcorn.
• AS
o If I was running the university and I wanted to look at how to change the structure of how a university runs to support multiple activities of this type I would have A finance team whose job it was simply to process quick turnaround short pump prime projects.
o So instead of having a faculty team you would have a rapid response finance team who would be there entirely for when RCs drop funding at last minute and you have 2 weeks to turn an application round, or you've got a pump prime project where money is handed out throughout the university and you would have a team whose job it was to be fast response (and across the university) and that would take away the barriers.
o In our faculty we have a brilliant finance team but trying to move things across faculties is really really tough so why not have a cross faculty finance team to fund interdisciplinary pump prime projects.
• AM
o The idea that structures are trivial- they're not. Structures define what you do. In universities and research councils. Applications are written to fit the structure of a RC. Its different for another Council and there are gaps and you have to work to bridge those gaps.
o This project at a small level exemplifies what interdisciplinary research should be about
? Clear objectives,
? Bringing people together
o Universities I hope will move away from that one PI model and look that PI has got a &pound;20M grant clearly its not that one person its loads of people in a team doing it. Science is not done by one person and &pound;20M. Its done by lots of people with small amounts of money or even no money. Can't we move to that model of doing science ? And that would have to be accepted by all sorts of organisations.
• AS
o Having that flexibility in how we worked.
o You would have to put in the same FEC costing form to get some BB money as you would for a whole massive grant. The overhead on our time was huge. The number of times we were like- we've some up with an idea, the deadline's tommorrow, **** we've got to do the FEC costing! Oh god its got to get signed off. Why can't the university understand that we've already got the money, why have we got to cost it again? And they would be like no, this is the procedure, and I would be like why? It was maybe more frustrating for us because we worked so well together and we'd figured out a way of transcending the boundaries, I couldn't understand why everybody else couldn't do it! That really upset me in a way and it was putting so much unnecessary pressure on people like CS, when she had other things to do with her time
• JS
o One of the things that has been important to the success and why things multiplied why BB is still going is that Bristol is a big enough and successful enough university mean that there have been other small pots of money to bid for and keep things going.
o I wonder whether part of the fact that some of the projects went on to bid for other sorts of funding &pound;15k, &pound;20k-&pound;50k is due to like the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute, GCRF things so there have been other mechanisms in place?
• MA
o That is true- other universities may not have been able to provide that additional support
o The GCRF, EPSRC institutional support went a long way
o GW4 money that we got, not huge amounts, but because BB existed we gave the university a vehicle to be able to spend some. Universities often find it difficult to spend some of the pots of money that they are given, and the reason that they would give us the money is that we could spend it for them.
o When they made it so difficult for us to spend it, we ended up not spending any of it (they actually gave us the money after the deadline!)
• KT
o With BB we had enough time to have multiple rounds.
• AS
o Examples of university contracts not liking the contracts that they negotiated and wanting to renegotiate them
• KT
o We need all sides, not just finance. Its one of the biggest hassle we had, everything else is fine!
• AM
o The spirit of BB lives on in Bristol AMR
• RH
o The ethos behind it and the amount of legwork that went on to train and connect people is enormous and thats the legacy
• MA
o You can tell by the way we interact why it worked.
 
Technology
• Only skype- people skyped in to meetings occasionally. Otherwise post its and flip charts.
 
Future of collaboration
• RH
o Technology that's available now means that you can communicate with people much more readily- it makes things easier, to work with people o the other side of the world but the fundamental cornerstone of it is still those personal relationships which I think requires people in person having conversations and the willingness to stretch across the divides.
• CS
o PhD students- although they have met physically they keep in touch through WhatsApp- we designed this portal for them, but no-body uses it. They have a whats app for their own cohort and a joint whats app
• MA
o Maybe we were successful because we used to play out in the street!
o We are going to Thailand next week for a project that KT and I are involved with and I will get more out of the 3 hours that we spend with them then than I have out of the last 6-7 skype meetings, I just think there is something, particularly when you are working across cultures as well, 
• KT
o The number of times you get pulled aside and its like &quot;actually, this is the problem, and we couldn't say it in an email&quot;.
• AS
o EPSRC SAT meeting- sustainable science- should people really be flying people across the world?
o If EPSRC would fund the tech to do teleconferencing properly,then you could do it but
o Industrial teleconferencing facilities that work are basically like an immersive whole room, so you genuinely feel like you are in the room with someone and it takes the whole wall, it costs &pound;1M.
o There are ways of doing virtual stuff effectively but you have to make a really committed effort to install the technology widely
o Facetime is ok for a 1:1 catch up but it doesn't work for a meeting or for world cafes etc
• LO
o It ruins the flow of conversations and its not being in the room and seeing what is happening over coffee and over lunch
• AM
o You miss that is going on in your peripheral vision
• LO
o And there serendipitous stuff is almost impossible
• AM
o That's right you can't
o We have a project with BP on VR- how you visualise catalysts virtually, where you can be in different locations but in the same physical space, and you could do that, for a specific purpose.
• KT
o We did do some technological things- like the crossfire thing
o Its like live youtube streaming- and people can ask questions and watch them live
• MA
o Sabine Hauert- had a lot of techy ideas and set up crossfire.
• RH
o It was quite good for telling people in the AMR sphere in Bristol what you are doing, and you can watch it later if you can't attend live.
• KT
o The time and space for creatvie thinking and the time in a room with cups of tea is important.
 
Language- was time the major way that you overcame these
• MA
o Guidance for people giving talks- not using jargon, explaining everything, most people went with that.
o Give plenty of chance for Qs
o Many of us took one for the team and asked potentially stupid Qs
o And thats one thing I have taken forward into future collaborations- I may ask a Q that I know the answer to already just to make sure that everybody knows the answer
• AS
o Its about not making assumptions- people might think they understand but within their world they do but not across disciplines
o One of the courses I run for postgrads- one of the things we do as part of the interdisciplinary team building exercise is we talk about language, I say to them write down, when I say, what is a cell?, write down what you understand a cell to be and most f them will write down its the basic function capable of sustaining life, a couple of the will write down its the american for mobile phone, and then I show them that if you look it up there are 28 different definitions of what a cell is. So depending on where you're coming from you might have a perfect understanding of what a cell is, to you, in your world, but actually that could be completely different to someone else's definition. And unless you have somebody clarifying and removing the assumptions that we all think we are on the same page, but actually we are not.
o So we used to start every kick off meeting with a few slides- this is what AMR is, this is what we are talking about when we mean AMR, because there was still the misconception right at the beginning about what was it that was actually resistant, people think its them, no its not you its the bacteria that are resistant and just getting people to understand that, which to one person might be a really simple concept but to others, the antibiotics work on me, so I must be resistant, that totally flies in the face wof what the project was trying to do.
o So I think removing assumptions by asking questions is crucial
• LO
o Common understanding creates common language
o Makes it easier for others to come in and join you
• KT
o When we were facilitating trying not to just talk but to listen and to clarify, what do you mean by that?
• MA
o Its really helped in aspects of my career that I'd never really though about until today, when I just thought about it!
o I gave a talk at Weston College to a group of 6th formers, and I feel that I now give PE talks that are much better than they work because I can think about it from different perspectives and I can think about what the misunderstandings can be for all of us, and you can bring that in to talks.
o You can really inspire kids about working together
o With social sciences- academic collaborations very difficult because of some of the absolutely fundamental differences in the way we do our jobs as academics and I think we were fortunate in a sense that the management team of BB have a similar way of doing our jobs and a similar way of doing research which is fundamentally- we have ideas with the people in our teams but we have teams, thats the point and if we have another project we have another team member to do that project. If you are in humanities, or an anthropologist, its you, its your research, you might have aPhD student but you almost certainly won't have a team, and so you've got to fit it into everything else that you've got to do, or you're not interested in doing it at all. To try and say, come on , we'll give you &pound;15k and we'll do a project, they'll look at you and go, well, alright, but when am I going to do this thing. 
o So it doesn't always work and sometimes it can fall apart if you don't understand the culture, now we've learned all that and now in Bristol AMR we are trying to learn to bridge a bigger divide which is how to bring a Professor of English or in Art History or Law into this
• CS
o And they don't do posters, we've learned that
• MA
o And if you had a session where people would discuss, they'd spend half the time explaining to you why that particular word shouldn't be used in that context, or why are you talking about combatting AMR
• LO
o And wanting to get that right before you move on.
• MA
o You have to get used to their world and work with it, but you can learn so much I think
• LO
o Its about people and emotional intelligence, EI as well as I- understanding what its like and putting yourself in other people's shoes.
• AM
o We were all aware of unconscious bias
o It taught me that we are unconsciously formed by the structures that we worked within, of your disciplines, how you communicate impact and output within a discipline, some disciplines don't have posters, some disciplines have conference papers, some disciplines have postdocs and some don't, things that you regard as the way the university works, well no this bit of the university doesn't work like that at all, so if you want to work with this bit of the university you are going to have to mish mash two bits of structure together so recognising the structure and how that defines what you do is quite important.

The analysis outputs include virtue continuum mapping and a video series plus other media to form a story line linked to an existing virtual community (Stilwell). We have also produce a decision making briefing and debriefing tools and resources. The aim is to allow personalised ethical debate in medical schools, junior doctor peer groups or with experienced doctor peer groups to build phronesis that is relevant to the medical leadership and ethical decision making in their particular contexts and specialties.

To date little research has explored the ways in which phronesis is cultivated over a period of time within one professional community. Conroy et al (2012) did this for a health and social care community including the medical community but there is an absence of research with medical professionals to explore how they have accumulated and enacted phronesis within their daily practice. Questions have rarely been asked as to how professionals are equipped morally (or otherwise) to navigate a chaotic world of practice rife with competing demands and relationships. To date, many researchers within medicine (e.g. Kaldjian 2014, Montgomery 2006) have made the case for a reorientation towards phronesis in medical education, but little has been undertaken to explore what that might look like.

Existing studies have tended to capture practical wisdom within one snapshot, within one organisation or by following one practitioner. We have followed three communities of doctors over three time periods: beginning of formal medical study; on placement at the end of formal study; and established medical professionals with 5 years plus qualified experience. This design (Conroy et al 2015) will offer an opportunity to see how phronesis develops over time whilst enabling a varied discussion about how moral resources are accessed and what the role of formal education is in equipping practitioners for the messy and subjective realities of practice.

By exploring how doctors at different points in their careers have access to or draw upon moral resources, the study gathered narratives about how they make 'good' decisions for the patient at hand; balancing care, compassion, quality, resources, capacity, medical outcomes and the wider well-being of the community. The added artistic element is that we gathered a collection of the participants narratives to creatively shape an original 'soap opera' style video series that connects to an existing virtual community of health and social care practitioners, patients and the public. That fictional virtual community is known as Stilwell (city suburb) with all the health and social care issues associated with a typical town in the UK. 

The methodology used is applicable to other sectors and disciplines such as care, education, law and business and therefore the research promises much wider benefits. 
This entry has three main sections. First it begins with an explanation of the methodology, second, the research design and methods are described in detail and then the entry ends with conclusions that explain the potential contribution to the field and the potential implications for policy and practice as well as suggested further research.

Methodology
The methodology is capable of answering the following research questions:

1. What does phronesis (pratical wisdom) mean to medical students and practitioners?
2. To what extent is phronesis cultivated, maintained and moulded over the educational and practice life of doctors in the UK?
3. To what extent can phronesis be promoted through educational and practice interventions?

Secondary questions:

a. What does an empirical study of phronesis within the medical context tell us about theoretical debates in virtue ethics?
b. Do understandings and enactments of phronesis change through medical education, and if yes how? 
c. How much room do doctors in the UK have for exhibiting phronesis in their professional practice?
d. Does phronesis play a role in sustaining the community's trust in the medical profession?
e. Are there enabling factors (e.g. presence of role models) and/or competing forces (e.g. marketization or bureaucratization) that influence the extent to which doctors can exhibit phronesis in professional practice? 
 
Conroy et al (2012) used MacIntyre's (1981) practice based community theory of virtue ethics including the virtue of Phronesis to present a mapping of virtue continuums for a health and social care community. The virtue continuums mapped were based on the stories told by the participants and showed where on the continuums each story was positioned hence the claimed Phronesis. What was clear from the last workshop with the community was how useful it was to the community to be able to see the virtue continuums presented and where the stories indicated decision points on the continuums. Their response to seeing this depiction of Phronesis was typically 'I realise now I need to move in x direction with y virtue continuum to make a better decision' (p9) In other words they were using the constructed picture of virtue continuums to help them improve their decision making based on their understanding of their own practice. This is very different to giving health and social care practitioners a set of ethical guidelines i.e. deontological principles to work to. Many writers on this subject e.g. Dawson (2010) have argued against the approach of using such ethical principles as they do not take into account the many different contextual variables of each ethical dilemma.

What is missing from studies to date is a fully contextualised depiction of stories about decision making and how they relate to all the professionals involved. Dawson (2010) additionally argues against deontological guidelines arising from quantitative or qualitative based research that do not acknowledge the uncertainty in the research evidence. Conroy (2010) acknowledges this issue in qualitative studies using narrative accounts and argues for a social constructionist based narrative approach as an ethical way to approach leadership and virtue ethics research and change with practitioners. In other words stories told by practitioners to a researcher may or may not be accounts of what actually happened, however, they do offer a window into the socially constructed nature of ethics and intersubjective reality of decision making in the professional community they practice. The arts based development to the methodology described here offers an ethical approach to the research by constructing a video series that depicts a virtual medical community making decisions, again based on the stories as in Conroy et al (2012) but also themes and a serial with episodes as demonstrated in Conroy (2010) and Czarniawska (1997) that shows the characters developing in their Phronesis due to certain events and therefore for them, how and why particular decisions have been taken. This arts based addition to the presentation of findings is novel in that although the virtual community (Stilwell 2016) has been used before to help substitute for placements (Walshe 2009) and as a leadership development resource (Conroy and Corrie 2014) it has not been used for the specific purpose of showing the socially constructed virtues and Phronesis informed decision making. We argue that this methodological approach leads to a useful resource for doctors in pre-clinical undergraduate education and post clinical/graduate training as well as offering a CPD resource for experienced doctors. This innovation in the methodology means that research can bridge the gap (Smith 2016) between research and practice in an ethical way that could have a very positive impact on the medical community and impact positively on the public perception of that community.

As we have seen above, an overall narrative approach to the nature of virtue (including phronesis) has been crucial to this project. In order to answer questions 1 and 2, we collected narratives of phronesis in action from medical students and doctors as well as narratives of the development of phronesis. We collected these narratives by conducting interviews, by observing medical students and doctors at work and by asking some of them to keep a narrative diary. We approached question 3 by involving the medical community in the co-production of a video series that uses dramatized stories to illustrate phronesis and its development in the medical context. In keeping with the narrative approach it is our contention that phronesis can also be best communicated and developed through narratives. For this part of the project we used a similar approach to that used by the Stillwell Multi-Media Virtual Community (Stilwell 2016) developed by the University of Cumbria. 

Methodological approach in detail
The methods were designed to collect narratives, diaries and observations about phronesis from medical students and doctors at various stages of their careers in the United Kingdom. Three main forms of data collection were used in the first phase of the study: e-portfolio notes, interviews and ethnographic observations. Interviews were semi-structured and developed from story gathering methods developed in Conroy et al (2012). Observations used an overt non-participant approach and all field notes were taken as unobtrusively as possible. Some of the study participants were asked to bring or later send their e-portfolio reflections of important. All interview, observation and e-portfolio notes were entered into NVivo10 with confidentiality protected. 
Interviews 
Semi-structured interviews lasting roughly 45 -60minutes have been held with 131 participants from all four cohorts and are used as the primary form of data collection in the study. The interviews were lightly-structured at first starting by explaining that we are interested in exploring the participant's experience of making ethical decisions whether these be their own or others they work with. Also whether they perceived them to be good or not good decisions. Participants were allowed to start discussion of the topic wherever and however they want. If they did not respond to this then the interviewer might say 'It seems hard for you to start on this subject, would you like to start with the difficulty?' We then asked them about instances or stories that they allude to in the difficulty. If the interviewee presented facts or offers general accounts they were invited to give specific examples relating to their account. Experience from previous studies (e.g. Conroy 2010) show that for most interviews explanation of the research aims and active listening signals are an excellent means of generating stories. The secondary research questions (framed in relation to their accounts) informed the structure for the second part of the interview to gain clarification of context, the characters involved, dilemmas, competing pressures, community response, etc. Participants were asked to recount stories of the following sorts: 
• where they felt they have applied their own practical wisdom to a work situation
• where they felt they could have acted more wisely 
• where they had seen a colleague making a particularly wise decision 
• where they had seen a colleague making a particularly unwise decision 
• whether they know of any particularly wise or unwise decisions that they have not experienced directly, but that have influenced them in their thinking 
• what they think the characteristics are of wise or unwise decisions in medicine. 

Observations 
Observations of individual participants from the four cohorts were undertaken during the fieldwork. Observing participants also provided context to the participants' development of phronesis (if it occurs), as well as their interviews and e-portfolios, which was important when developing the video series. A selection of experienced practitioners were observed in the multidisciplinary team meetings that many attend on a weekly basis. 
Participant kept diaries - e-portfolios 
Originally we were going to ask our participants to keep diaries about any ethical decisions they experience but we later established that some keep e-portfolios where they record their experiences and reflections. These are self-reflexive and can be used to provide context and reflections for decisions the diarist makes, or decisions they see others making in practice. The participants were asked to send e-portfolios to the researchers. Only a few e-portfolios were collected and entered into NVivo. 
Analysis 

The initial social science-based analysis was used as a way to reveal themes and extract stories and a serial for the arts-based analysis. The thematic (social science) analysis element used a Framework Approach (Ritchie et al 2010) to yield themes or categories of what doctors find important, typologies of people and events and medical workers' behaviour. Virtue Continuum coding was conducted in NVivo 11. The end goal was to consolidate a set of virtues contained in the data that could be used as the basis of the video series and the theoretical analysis. The nature of phronesis was examined through two theoretical lenses: MacIntyre's (1981) virtue ethics and Kaldjian's (2010) medical phronesis. Virtue ethics provides a virtues-goods-practices-institution schema (Moore and Beadle 2006) which comprises a number of theoretical concepts relating to phronesis: 
• Virtues: disposition to act in a certain way that enables us to achieve internal goods (includes wisdom) 
• Internal goods: the excellence of products/services and the perfection of the individual in the process. 
• External goods: only contingently attached to a practice e.g. money, status and power Practice: any coherent and complex form of social activity e.g. medicine, nursing, social work etc. 
• Institutions: primarily concerned with producing and distributing external goods
• Narrative quest: search for our purpose (telos) toward wellbeing (eudaimonia) 
• Communal narrative quest: arising from a meshing of practice virtues and a telos of collective wellbeing. 
The Medical Phronesis lens held alongside virtue ethics helped us to contextualise the notion of phronesis. According to Kaldjian (2010: 559), phronesis in the context of medicine encompasses: 
• Pursuit of worthwhile ends 
• Accurate perception of concrete circumstances 
• Commitment to moral principles and virtues
• Deliberation that integrates ends, concrete circumstances and moral principles or virtues 
• Motivation to act in order to achieve the conclusions reached by such deliberation. 
 
An initial output of the analyses has been a virtue continuum mapping of 15 virtues to illustrate phronesis enactment across all the data. The next stage was the virtual community media production. The media includes a video series, blogs, social media, newspaper pages etc. to create a whole teaching package. The process of moving from data and analysis to the video series was a co-production between the creative director, the research team, participant representatives and a consultant and GP. Initially a series of workshops were convened to map out the story boards and characters for the video serial and to link to characters within the wider Stilwell virtual community (http://www.stilwelleducation.com) Once the story boards were agreed the creative director arranged for a script to be written for each video episode based on our findings (15 virtue continuums and the narratives from our participants relating to each virtue) The scripts was reviewed by cohort representatives, the researchers and medical educators from each of the partnering institutions. Ethical dilemmas are presented in each episode and provide focus for each episode. These will be related to a session within a series of blocks in a medical training programme module. For example a first theme might be 'From Pillar to Post' showing the competing pressures as described above and the potential for impressionable and unstable positions taken by a fledgling doctor. Second might be 'A Purposeful Stand' showing a doctor gaining clarity of purpose and deciding where they stand in relation to the competing pressures, ideologies and practical dilemmas. Third might be 'Maintaining an Ethical Stance' showing how that stance plays out in a number of different interactions with other doctors, nursing staff, patients, family, social services etc. and how in practice that stance might not always produce the desired outcomes for patients. These examples show that many different themes and storylines that were explored in a serial format with the same characters to enable medical student reflection and debate on the concept and practice of phronesis. Once the scripts were agreed the film production team, who are well versed in Stilwell productions, co-produced the videos using professional actors and advice from cohort representatives, a consultant and the researchers. 

Conclusion 
The methodology described here is capable of providing an artistic presentation of the issues of phronesis in a medical community or any practice based community for that matter. The video series 'soap opera' and the way it links to the existing virtual community will be debated with a broad audience of academics, practitioners, patients and policy makers and others with an interest in the field at our final workshop. The video series will offer an innovative, edgy complement to the many text based recommendations that have emanated from scandal enquiry reports and social science based studies to date. New understandings of the cultivation of phronesis in medical communities and its role in rebuilding public trust in the light of many scandals will be of interest to healthcare researchers, educators, practitioners and policymakers. The aim is to impact on the medical and professional education of doctors as a community, building stronger links between the medical community and the public and rebuilding public confidence in the medical profession. MacIntyre (1981, 2009) argues that moral debating resources are missing from ethical education and the wider theological and philosophical context of any practice. We argue here that the methodological approach and the resultant outputs offer the education and training of doctors a moral debating resource in the form of virtue continuum mapping and the added resource of a video series plus other media to form a virtual community presentation and the possibility of a decision making resource to aide in-action decision making and after- action reviews of decision making.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2018","Two of the most most notable impact examples are first, interest from the UK Merchant Banking sector and an offer has been made to the PI to meet Merchant Banking advisors. The idea proposed is to use a similar methodological approach (research, film production and moral debate resource) tailored for their use. Their ethical decision-making is associated with multinational corporations and high net worth individuals and has considerable international impact. Typical decisions involve international financing, underwriting, real estate, trade finance, foreign investment, consultation on trades and trading technology. The second example, a senior advisor to the UK government's Department for International Development (DfID) who reviewed the resources on the project website thought their non-prescriptive nature means they are more likely to be embraced and used by DfID members. This has the potential to improve ethical decision-making to impact on the well-being of people in the countries supported by DfID. These include Somalia, Nigeria, South Sudan, Congo, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Rohingya. The advisor has already discussed the use of the resources with the DfID members. He said 'This looks really interesting and I am sure that [UK government cabinet minister] would go for this. His bookincludes a lot about this type of knowledge that he says is missing' The DfID connection will progress with the co-authoring of a paper (with the advisor taking a lead) tailored to the interests of the members and then presented at one of their meetings. 

A great deal of national and international interest has been shown in the methodology and the PI, Dr Mervyn Conroy, has been approached by academics from the UK and US who have asked him to share the methodology so they can replicate the study with medics and nurse in healthcare institutions connected to their universities. The methodology is defined in the final report but will also be a journal publication that will be published later this year.","http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/social-policy/departments/health-services-management-centre/research/projects/2015/phronesis-and-the-medical-community.aspx","58c0647b3d8753.22568682","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c0647b3d8753.22568682&grantRef=AH%2FM006646%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/M006646/1","CA9BD931-CE4F-46BE-92DC-276D8BF99FC3","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","818CD6C9-61EE-41F2-9F37-0C7A8F43E25D","32F4C0BC-6B69-46C2-B2B5-30D1D271D977"

In this project, a state-of-the-art multi-fidelity design and modelling research tool and method were developed to provide a systematic assessment of a micro gas turbine combustion system. In particular, the developed research tool/method provides design, analysis, and optimisation towards the development for a multi-fuel, reliable, high efficiency, cost-effective, and low emissions micro gas turbine combustion system.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2019","The key features of the developed state-of-the-art design tool are as follows:
1) Rapid design strategy and design space exploration -A dedicated state-of-the-art was developed to allow researchers quickly identify and derive the design strategy/solutions in order to achieve the design goals based on various of design inputs involving combustor inlet and outlet aerothermal and geometrical information; type of micro gas turbine cycle (i.e., simple or recuperated), fuel types (i.e., gas or liquid), engine operating conditions, design requirements (i.e. efficiency, cost, low emissions, reliability, etc.)

2) Aerodynamic design for a multi-fuel combustor- The detailed design and development on a multi-fuel combustor for micro-gas turbines are not yet fully explored. The current developed state-of-the-art provides a dedicated aerodynamic design for a multi-fuel burner. In particular, the method to estimate the airflow splits, the method to conceive a multi-fuel injector arrangement, the method to investigate the effect of different fuels on combustor performance, etc. are incorporated in the developed framework.

3) Improved first-order accuracy of the preliminary design method/tool: For preliminary design and sizing of a micro gas turbine combustion system, the currently developed state-of-the-art comprises inter-related design elements including aerodynamics, heat transfer analysis, performance and emissions that are coupled in the preliminary design phase. Furthermore, the data generated from the high-fidelity studies were used to refined methods for the combustor component design and allow more design factors to be taken into account. In particular, the effects of combustor liner geometry, the effects of fuel nozzle geometry and arrangement, the effects of dome front shape, the effect of other source of renewable and alternative fuels, etc. 

4) Multi-fidelity design and modelling approach specific to micro gas turbine system - A dedicated multi-fidelity state-of-the-art was developed to improve the fundamental understanding of the design process and numerical simulations specific to micro gas turbine combustion system. For combustor chamber development, the state-of-the-art provided evaluation for design approaches and assessed the robustness and applicability for the typical micro gas turbine system.

In our recent paper, we have described that just minutes after in vivo challenge of mice, 'typically-extracellular' bacteria efficiently replicate in tissue macrophages (Ercoli Nature Microbiology 2018). Subsequently, we have realised that once bacteria have been delivered in vivo to splenic tissue macrophages, the organs can be collected, sliced and cultured ex vivo in the laboratory. In these tissue slices - which conserve the 3D microarchitecture - we observe that bacteria continue to replicate within the macrophages (unpublished). The availability from a single infected organ to prepare approximately forty slices in which bacteria are rapidly replicating within cells, and which can be conveniently incubated in flat bottomed micro-titre plates, prompted us to attempt to exploit this tool for within-tissue susceptibility testing.
Our unpublished data show that a 6-hour incubation of the tissue slices in the presence of serial dilutions of antibiotic allows for detection of bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity of the drugs in question. The format of the method is comparable to a classical microbroth dilution assay, with the exception that one infected organ slice (obtained 30 minutes after in vivo challenge) is incubated in each microtitre well. Antimicrobial drugs are then added as in standard susceptibility testing and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBC/MFC) are detected by bacterial colony counting. After six hours of incubation bacterial enumeration allows determination of growth, inhibition and bactericidal activity of a drug. Our pilot data show that pharmacokinetic drug penetration ratios correlate well with the experimental intra-extra-cellular drug efficacy ratios determined by our method on a model strain.","Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo","","","Yes","2019","An outline grant on the use of organotypic slice as an antimicrobial drug activity testing method during the phases of hit characterisation and hit to lead development.

The Government websites were seminal to the process, which began with the National Cyber Security Centre website and nodes were created in the structure deduced from the information provided on the website. Then, the focus moved outwards to other Departments and agencies in the Government. Throughout this process connections between programmes, units, and departments became more evident and these were also drawn on through the 'relationships' tool. 

This process for such a widely ranging policy issue like cyber security is extremely ad hoc in discovering new programmes and teams within departments. Many of these were derived from third party sources such as an official press release as opposed to a programme or unit website. Furthermore, the nature of the policy issue is consistently shaping and re-shaping the security landscape, and the Government reacts to these changes. Thus, the map is constantly shifting in structure to accurately represent the different outputs/teams/departments with cybersecurity programmes or teams. 

Through this iterative methodology allowances of accuracy must be made due to the available information from URL sources, especially those from such a large entity like the UK Government. Often the information on URLs are outdated as a result of the consistently changing structures and programmes within HMG, therefore it is not possible to obtain complete accuracy. However, the mapping of alternative policy issues may be easier. For instance, the mapping of the environmental policy network does not shift so quickly because current Government emphasis on policy and security is directed towards cybersecurity and not the environment. Furthermore, each department does not create environmental policies and thus the map will be smaller and more organised. The composition of the map (complexity, scope, etc.) will depend largely on the nature of the policy issue and its organisation/emphasis within the Government. 

After the HTML map was generated a commenting function was coded into the map in order to allow users to individually comment on the accuracy of the map, thereby enabling faster validation. This was created by the ECSEPA team who also assessed the map for further iterations and liaised with an external graphic designer to create an interactive, user-friendly web version.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2018","Through this new technique readily available mind mapping tools can be used to generate visually accessible policy network analysis and be exported in several useful formats. The most important and useful exporting format is HTML, whereby a user can interact with the map through opening/closing nodes, attaching URL links, documents, and notes to each node which enable enhanced accessibility. This can significantly increase the impact of research by exploring network analysis and provide a comprehensive tool for readers/users, which could significantly change how academics carry out policy network analysis. This software enables a tangible visual representation of organisational structure, allowing for more in-depth analysis of networks but also provide a usable product that could be significant to their research design and outputs. This method could also provide a step in the creation of widely distributed maps. For example, through the Mindjet software a basic map was created with all essential information, structures and links, and the next step is to provide a graphic designer with the map to create a more marketable and user-friendly version as we have done in our research. Such maps have been very well-received by the Government as a potential skills, training, and educational tool for staff working in the public and private sectors. It is also regarded as a useful product for the general public to learn about what the cybersecurity landscape looks like within the Government and how its governance is being carried out.","https://www.mindjet.com/","5a9eb320c1b183.52649153","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5a9eb320c1b183.52649153&grantRef=EP%2FP011691%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/P011691/1","505A72C3-B780-4AC3-9AA1-A264103FBC5F","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","9C10D78F-6430-4CA7-9528-B96B0762A4C6","D554E5B9-1E74-4A86-851B-FA571FED48F2"

Busy roads can cause problems for people who want to walk along them or to cross them, and also for people living nearby. In addition to noise and air pollution, the main difficulties are caused by:
? the volume, or sometimes the speed, of traffic;
? too few crossings; and
? not enough time to get across. 
All these can be unpleasant, but they can be more than that too - they can affect people's health and wellbeing. The impacts can be direct, for example from air pollution. They can also be indirect: for example, health can be affected when busy roads separate local residents from goods, services, or other people. This barrier effect is sometimes called 'community severance'. The UCL Street Mobility team has developed this toolkit, offering a suite of research approaches to identify, assess and value this barrier effect or 'community severance'.

This toolkit contains tools developed to help local government and local communities assess, and value the costs of, community severance in their area. Knowing what the problem is in more detail helps to make a case for change. 
The toolkit is divided into eight sections, as follows: 
Introduction (this section) provides background information about the purpose of this project. It includes a table summarising the various tools for assessing the barrier effects of busy roads and what resources are needed to use for each one.
What we know summarises the evidence about what 'community severance' is and how it affects people's lives, including their health and wellbeing. It also includes some references, for anyone who wants to read more about this. All work produced by UCL Street Mobility team members is available to all (open access). Where possible, we have used freely available sources for referencing other people's work, but access to some studies may be restricted.
The next five sections explain the tools we have created to help local government and communities measure the effects of busy roads (Participatory mapping, the Health and Neighbourhood Mobility survey, Video surveys, Valuation, and Walkability).
The last section describes other, existing tools that we have found useful (Space syntax, Street audits). 
Which tool (or tools) are selected for use depends on:
? What the users want to find out and/or measure; and
? What resources they have available (time, people, expertise, money).

A Table is included in the toolkit to help potential users decide which tool(s) to use. It lists the tools, describes what they are for, and what resources are needed to use them. Each of the tools can be used independently, but can also be used in combination with any of the other tools, and in any order. 
For example, a community group might use participatory mapping and a street audit. A local authority might start with the Health and Neighbourhood Mobility survey and the valuation tool. A single tool can provide useful information, but using a range of tools will provide a more comprehensive assessment. The tools allow the problem to be broken down into smaller sections that can be dealt with by different people or groups. The toolkit also helps to forge links across sectors and departments. Local community groups and local government staff working together can produce the best information.

Certain people, such as children and the elderly, or those with physical or mental health impairments, may be particularly sensitive and vulnerable to the effects of busy roads. Several of the tools contained in this toolkit can be used to identify and assess such inequalities. 

The tools will generally be used to measure the current barrier effect. However, some of the tools can be used to predict what the effects might be if there are changes. They can contribute to a vision of what streets can be like. They can also be used to monitor or evaluate the effects of interventions.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2017","It was launched on 8th March 2017, so it is too soon to show any impacts.","http://www.ucl.ac.uk/street-mobility/toolkit","58bec16084f8b4.39213154","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58bec16084f8b4.39213154&grantRef=EP%2FK037323%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K037323/1","7EEE154B-3AB6-4FC4-9788-8F08785909CC","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","5E6B1EA0-63D0-4D4B-B7E6-6CB08878725D"

CARDAMOM (CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework) is a computer programme that retrieves terrestrial carbon (C) cycle variables by combining C cycle observations with a mass balance model. CARDAMOM produces global dynamic estimates of plant and soil C pools, their exchanges with each other and with the atmosphere, and C cycling variables for processes driving change. A Bayesian method is used to retrieve model parameters that statistically reduce the difference between model outputs and C observations for each model cell. The outcome is a probabilistic assessment of the fluxes, pools and process variables of the C cycle in each cell.

Why is it useful?
CARDAMOM produces a C cycle analysis consistent with C measurements and climate. It is well suited for using with global-scale satellite observations, for instance aboveground biomass or leaf area index. CARDAMOM produces a confidence interval on all retrieved quantities, so that there is a clear assessment of model-data consistency, and the value of assimilating extra datasets can be quantitatively assessed.

Why is it novel?
Conventional C cycle estimates rely on prescribed C cycle parameters; CARDAMOM retrieves parameters by combining models with data. The implementation of the CARDAMOM family of C models, (DALEC models), differs from typical model implementations: there is no spin-up for biomass and soil C, and no prescribed plant functional types or C pool steady state. CARDAMOM generates maps of key model parameters as an output, rather than as an input. Rather than being compared to data, the CARDAMOM outputs represent the best fit to all data within each CARDAMOM cell.

How does it work?
CARDAMOM has several components. First is a C mass balance model, DALEC, that has four vegetation pools and two dead organic matter pools (these pools can be adjusted to test alternate structures). There are around 20 model parameters associated with phenology (plant timing), allocation, residence times, temperature sensitivity and productivity. The second component is a system to arrange and organise spatial data related to forcing (climate, burned area, management) and to observations for assimilation (currently LAI, biomass, soil C). The third component is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo code, that operates on each model grid cell to retrieve model parameter vectors consistent with data. The fourth component is a structure to manage model-data interactions, distribute jobs to parallel computing nodes, retrieve state and process variables from optimized model parameters, and to summarise results for analysis.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2016","We have generated publications, begun international partnerships, and been invited to speak about our research tool.",,"5c6eaf9a285989.83464690","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c6eaf9a285989.83464690&grantRef=NE%2FK002619%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K002619/1","4D6BF013-631B-4B24-ABB6-9AC8CF1C4F93","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","B5BB39B9-0CFA-4514-8973-73C327F59EFE"

essential tremor and epilepsy is an established palliative
treatment. DBS uses electrical neuromodulation to suppress
symptoms. Most current systems provide a continuous pattern
of fixed stimulation, with clinical follow-ups to refine settings
constrained to normal office hours. An issue with this management
strategy is that the impact of stimulation on circadian,
i.e. sleep-wake, rhythms is not fully considered; either in the
device design or in the clinical follow-up. Since devices can be
implanted in brain targets that couple into the reticular activating
network, impact on wakefulness and sleep can be significant.
This issue will likely grow as new targets are explored, with
the potential to create entraining signals that are uncoupled
from environmental influences. To address this issue, we have
designed a new brain-machine-interface for DBS that combines
a slow-adaptive circadian-based stimulation pattern with a fastacting
pathway for responsive stimulation, demonstrated here for
seizure management. In preparation for first-in-human research
trials to explore the utility of multi-timescale automated adaptive
algorithms, design and prototyping was carried out in line with
ISO risk management standards, ensuring patient safety. The ultimate
aim is to account for chronobiology within the algorithms

The aim of this study was to rethink the current method to process thermograms and derive temporal responses of stomatal conductance (gsw) using dynamic energy balance equations. Time-series thermograms provided the basis for a spatial and temporal characterisation of gsw responses in wheat (Triticum aestivum). A leaf replica with a known conductance was used to validate the approach and to test the ability of our model to be used with any material and under any environmental conditions. The results highlighted the importance of the coordinated stomatal responses that run parallel to the leaf blade despite their patchy distribution. The diversity and asymmetry of the temporal response of gsw observed after a step increase and step decrease in light intensity can be interpreted as a strategy to maximize photosynthesis per unit of water loss and avoid heat stress in response to light- flecks in a natural environment.","Physiological assessment or outcome measure","","","Yes","2019","This study removes a major bottleneck for plant phenotyping platforms and will pave the way to further developments in our understanding of stomatal behaviour.","https://watermark.silverchair.com/erz068.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAmMwggJfBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJQMIICTAIBADCCAkUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM76OpANAULNLydekYAgEQgIICFrun73qMqQQDHgNVwjX3YC688TKyXEeIiir0uA_2HAXYUAarvsAX7cdwPYpAbej_mZp41D1IQkz9i0TFH0Y3EEGA7v58vTXrS1jckizdqnjUOIuYSxYO2hHMGJPJ5n4iHMGNWTCJu2O3sh3bJIkHzeflxl-cTqkKU1TFF_ehLsuZ4vCyldY1TS4xXmGO85og96lKjeVixpqLJKavalNN9RRR3r691OuGKSCkx_gnSFZmHK6fJQKeTwEN4IHMrZWNnX43KCZibVwYfqtABPENaRywRd-s_oz4QC-q","5c88e2083c4b36.15105538","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c88e2083c4b36.15105538&grantRef=BB%2FN021061%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/N021061/1","7C2D6728-7E0A-4C1F-8C43-30C81FE1C801","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","936D002F-A8D1-4A93-AE5D-825ED0903D8D","2D3AE7F2-F8C9-4902-8E72-8612B03E74CA"

We present a stochastic two-state switch model for the population of mRNA molecules in single cells where genes stochastically alternate between a more active ON state and a less active OFF state. We prove that the stationary solution of such a model can be written as a mixture of a Poisson and a Poisson-beta probability distribution. This finding facilitates inference for single cell expression data, observed at a single time point, from flow cytometry experiments such as FACS or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as it allows one to sample directly from the equilibrium distribution of the mRNA population. We hence propose a Bayesian inferential methodology using a pseudo-marginal approach and a recent approximation to integrate over unobserved states associated with measurement error.
We provide a general inferential framework which can be widely used to study transcription in single cells from the kind of data arising in flow cytometry experiments. The approach allows us to separate between the intrinsic stochasticity of the molecular dynamics and the measurement noise. The methodology is tested in simulation studies and results are obtained for experimental multiple single cell expression data from FISH flow cytometry experiments.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2018","The paper describing the tool has been cited already four times despite its recent publication, indicating acceptance by the research community and therefore positive impact on academia.",,"5c87e85139f492.07680782","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c87e85139f492.07680782&grantRef=BB%2FL006340%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/L006340/1","45731C59-EF9B-40AB-AD86-CEDDE29F0D9B","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","B6FB652A-60C3-48DD-9A33-075D1F759B48","A85C1BEB-2F00-43BB-A9DD-4C0D550FE346"

CARDAMOM (CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework) is a computer programme that retrieves terrestrial carbon (C) cycle variables by combining C cycle observations with a mass balance model. CARDAMOM produces global dynamic estimates of plant and soil C pools, their exchanges with each other and with the atmosphere, and C cycling variables for processes driving change. A Bayesian method is used to retrieve model parameters that statistically reduce the difference between model outputs and C observations for each model cell. The outcome is a probabilistic assessment of the fluxes, pools and process variables of the C cycle in each cell.

Why is it useful?
CARDAMOM produces a C cycle analysis consistent with C measurements and climate. It is well suited for using with global-scale satellite observations, for instance aboveground biomass or leaf area index. CARDAMOM produces a confidence interval on all retrieved quantities, so that there is a clear assessment of model-data consistency, and the value of assimilating extra datasets can be quantitatively assessed.

Why is it novel?
Conventional C cycle estimates rely on prescribed C cycle parameters; CARDAMOM retrieves parameters by combining models with data. The implementation of the CARDAMOM family of C models, (DALEC models), differs from typical model implementations: there is no spin-up for biomass and soil C, and no prescribed plant functional types or C pool steady state.

While they were originally developed in the context of single or multisite datasets covering small spatial scales, they are increasingly applied across much larger regions that transcend major abiotic gradients and dispersal barriers. Incorporating spatial variation in occupancy is a significant problem in this context, due to the large number of species, each with varying spatial patterns of occupancy, and due to the difficulty in capturing some of these determinants of occupancy via environmental covariates. Our solution is to use pre-existing range information (in the form of range maps) to constrain occupancy to areas in which a species is known to exist and allow for generating spatial covariates such as distance to range margin. Specifically, range maps are used to crop out areas that are distant from a species range so that occupancy is treated as 0. Further, a covariate summarising range position allows for occupancy to drop off towards geographical range margins. The bMSOM generates dramatically better predictive performance than traditional MSOMs, while also reducing the computational overhead of fitting these models. It avoids the severe spatial biases in predictions that are generated by MSOMs and allows for principled species-specific inference, even for rarely or never-observed species.","Biological samples","","","Yes","2022","The MS describing the method is currently available on bioArxiv, and associated code is on github.

This framework allows one to consider:

- spontaneous patient colonization,
- patient-staff contamination/colonization,
- environmental contamination,
- patient cohorting,
- health-care workers (HCWs) hand-washing compliance levels,

among other factors affecting bacterial spread in hospital settings. I believe this will represent a significant step forward in the area, since it is a single unified framework which contains many existing models in the literature as particular case studies. Thus, by computing the reproduction number of the different agents in the hospital ward, one is able to identify the most probable routes of bacterial spread for different outbreaks in different hospital settings. In particular, bacterial outbreaks involving Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, or Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, are analysed in this work for outbreaks occurring at different hospital wards, such as the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit at Beijing Tongren Hospital, or the onco-haematological unit at the University Medical Center Freiburg in Germany.","Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human","","","No","2018","I believe this work, once published, will represent a significant step forward in the area, since it is a single unified framework which contains many existing models in the literature as particular case studies.

While they were originally developed in the context of single or multisite datasets covering small spatial scales, they are increasingly applied across much larger regions that transcend major abiotic gradients and dispersal barriers. Incorporating spatial variation in occupancy is a significant problem in this context, due to the large number of species, each with varying spatial patterns of occupancy, and due to the difficulty in capturing some of these determinants of occupancy via environmental covariates. Our solution is to use pre-existing range information (in the form of range maps) to constrain occupancy to areas in which a species is known to exist and allow for generating spatial covariates such as distance to range margin. Specifically, range maps are used to crop out areas that are distant from a species range so that occupancy is treated as 0. Further, a covariate summarising range position allows for occupancy to drop off towards geographical range margins. The bMSOM generates dramatically better predictive performance than traditional MSOMs, while also reducing the computational overhead of fitting these models. It avoids the severe spatial biases in predictions that are generated by MSOMs and allows for principled species-specific inference, even for rarely or never-observed species.","Biological samples","","","Yes","2022","The MS describing the method is currently available on bioArxiv, and associated code is on github.

The seeds include improved varieties of maize, sorghum, soya and sunflower. After a lottery assigning participants to a treatment (40%) or control group, treatment subjects are awarded a free insurance on the land they farm using certified improved seeds. If they do not buy any improved seeds they do not get the insurance-even if they have won the lottery.
Of 832 farmers correctly reached by the intervention, 366 won the insurance lottery and 466 did not. Table 1 shows that the randomization worked as expected; there are no significant differences across the two groups.
The main objective of the project is to see to what extent the presence of free insurance increases the appeal of improved seed varieties (conditional crowding-in) as well as other inputs (unconditional crowding-in), and to what extent this leads to different farming decisions and outcomes. It is possible to conduct an intention to treat (ITT) analysis, taking all lottery winners as if they had indeed benefitted from the insurance and vice versa (as the insurance is conditional on purchasing quality seeds, this is not necessarily the case). This will yield conservative estimates of the impact. It is also possible to conduct LATE and TOT estimates.
By design, it is expected that the presence of insurance may induce some farmers that otherwise would not have purchased improved seeds do to so. Indeed, 434 farmers purchased at least one packet of quality seeds: 46% of the control group and 59% of treatment. The difference in uptake may mean that &quot;worse&quot; farmers are taking up improved seeds that they would not otherwise have purchased. This may downwardly bias the estimates with respect to average productivity and income when comparing these two groups. To measure this effect, in 28 out of 40 farmer groups we also provided a random subsample of control farmers a surprise lottery (40%) in case they had previously decided to purchase quality seeds independently of the project. The insurance is based on the amount of seeds purchased within three days after participation to the surprise lottery, allowing everybody to increase the amount of packets purchased regardless of its outcome. This allows for differences in total input purchases between surprise lottery winners and losers. In total 228 free crop insurances conditional on quality seeds were awarded.

The probes used in the OLA assay were designed against the core gene sequence of genotype E (ayw4) (Genebank accession number X75657). Ligation primers specific for wild-type sequences were labeled at the 5' end with digoxigenin, mutant-specific primers were labeled with fluorescein. The common oligonucleotide which hybridises downstream of the wild type and mutant was labeled at the 3' end with biotin and phosphorylated at the 5' end . This primer anneals to nucleotides in the specific regions of the HBV pre-C/BCP gene immediately adjacent to the 3' end of both the mutant and wild type genomes. The tests were performed utilizing a reaction mixture containing 1x ligase buffer (100 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM NAD (Sigma, UK.), 80 Mm KCl (Sigma), 0.1% Triton X-100), 3 U of thermostable ligase (Epicentre Technologies, UK.) and 3 pmol of each ligation primer. Detection of mutant and wild type genotypes was achieved by the simultaneous addition of anti-digoxigenin-peroxidase (POD), (Boehringer Mannheim) and anti-fluorescein-alkaline phosphatase (AP), (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by sequential washing and addition of GIBCO ELISA amplification system (Invitrogen) and TMB substrate (Promega) to detect mutant and wild type sequences respectively. The optical densities were measured using a Multiscan Ascent Elisa plate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Finland) at wavelengths of 490 nm and 450 nm for mutant and wild type respectively. It was also possible to read the plates visually as this may be important for areas of poor resource settings where ELISA plate readers are not easily available (data not shown). Samples were considered mutant alone (magenta and positive OD490), wild type alone (yellow and positive OD450) or mixture of wild type and mutant (magenta and yellow plus positive OD490 and OD450). 2) Real-time PCR to quantify hepatitis B virus DNA in chronic carriers. DNA was extracted from 200 &micro;L of serum using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was eluted into 100 &micro;L nuclease-free water and 5?l added to a 25?l PCR reaction mixture. The reaction was carried out using a commercial SYBR-Green reaction mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The kit contains HotStarTaq polymerase which is included to avoid false positives in the quantitative PCR. The primer sequences were 5'-GTG TCT GCG GCG TTT TAT CA (sense) and 5' GAC AAA CGG GCA ACA TAC CTT (antisense) designed to amplify a 98 base pair product from positions 379 to 476 of the HBV genome. Thermal cycling was performed in an ABi 5700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Reaction conditions were: 95OC for 15 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94OC for 15 seconds, 55OC for 30 seconds and 72OC for 30 seconds. A four point standard curve (1.5x108copies per millilitre (cpm), 1.5x106cpm, 1.5x104cpm, 1.5x102cpm) was generated from a high titre plasma donation quantified by end point dilution PCR. The calibration of this standard was confirmed by comparison with an International HBV DNA standard, (97/746) (NIBSC, Potters Bar, UK). Test samples falling above the top of the standard curve were re-assayed at a dilution of 1:100. Each test run included positive and negative controls. The performance of the assay was evaluated by comparison with a commercial assay (HBV Monitor, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ 08876 USA) performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","Both tools are cheaper than conventional DNA sequencing and commercial assays.",,"A802E9B74AB","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=A802E9B74AB&grantRef=MC_U190081996","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MC_U190081996","CDD177FB-452D-4829-8CD0-9D3D7BCA75F1","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","6083E7FB-0220-4F5F-97B0-7F6113B49A0C","13569EF5-7C82-4648-9E00-EBA5A579BF8C"

Pericytes control blood flow in capillaries, regulate leukocyte migration to underlying tissues and can contribute to tissue fibrosis and repair. Vascular smooth muscle cells strengthen the walls of large blood vessels and regulate blood flow. The analysis of these cells in animal models has been complicated due to the lack of cell type specific genes. Contractile proteins that are often used to mark smooth muscle cells are expressed by numerous other cell types, whereas only few markers have been identified for pericytes and even these are widely expressed in diverse mesodermal and neural tissues. I found that in most tissues CD146 shares expression with NG2 only in pericytes and not in other cell types where either one or the other gene is expressed separately. Both of these genes are also expressed in developing aortic smooth muscle cells and in developing as well as mature smooth muscle of smaller arteries. Here we established a novel triple-transgenic mouse model that combines the specificity of the expression patterns of CD146 and NG2 to label perivascular cells and accurately follow their fate. In a previously established mouse model NG2 gene regulatory elements drive the expression of CRE recombinase after tamoxifen administration (NG2-CRE-ERTM) (Zhu et al., Development 2011). I generated a new mouse model in which CD146 gene regulatory elements drive the expression of flippase and red fluorescent protein (Roostalu et al., Circ Res 2018), but only in cells that simultaneously express CRE recombinase. When this model is crossed to NG2-CRE-ERTM model CD146+NG2+ perivascular cells are marked by red fluorescence and start to express flippase. Cells that express either CD146 or NG2 alone remain unlabelled. When the double transgenic model is crossed to a third established line in which ubiquitous promoter drives the expression of green fluorescent protein only in cells that express flippase (Sousa et al., Cereb Cortex 2009) the CD146+NG2+ cells are also marked by green fluorescence. When CD146+NG2+ cells differentiate (in smooth muscle maturation or by pericyte differentiation into other cell types) they cease expressing red fluorescent marker protein but maintain green fluorescent marker, which is carried over to the following cell generations through mouse lifespan. This model provides a unique opportunity to specifically identify when and how perivascular cells are replaced in blood vessel walls in healthy physiology and in tissue injury response and whether pericytes can give rise to other cell types.","Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo","","","Yes","2018","Using this transgenic mouse model we found that CD146+NG2+ cells emerge at first in early embryonic development in the wall of the primitive aorta. These cells share many characteristics with microvascular pericytes. They proliferate extensively to give rise to all the smooth muscle cell lineages that are maintained in the aortic wall to adulthood. These results suggest that there is very limited contribution from cells outside the aorta to its composition during postnatal growth period and in adult vascular wall homeostasis. The vast majority if not all the cells in aortic wall are descendants of embryonic CD146+NG2+ immature smooth muscle cells.
We showed that while CD146 is rapidly downregulated in aortic smooth muscle already in the fetus it is maintained at aortic branching sites. We demonstrated that these cells represent a unique self-renewing immature smooth muscle cell population with distinct molecular and functional characteristics. It is widely recognized that aortic branching sites are prone to atherosclerosis, but the reasons have remained largely unknown. Our discovery of a specialized cell population at these locations provides new opportunities to specifically target these cells in mouse models of cardiovascular diseases and to develop drugs that precisely inhibit the activation of these cells and formation of atherosclerotic lesions.
Smooth muscle cell activation and excessive proliferation following arterial surgery can lead to vascular wall thickening and occlusion. Anti-proliferative drugs are frequently applied with stents to prevent the process and have shown success in limiting in-stent restenosis. However this is not possible in most other types of surgeries and consequently the failure rates have remained high (30-50% failure in coronary bypass surgeries over 5 year period). Characterization of arterial cellular response to surgery is of paramount importance to find ways to improve the efficacy. This mouse model enabled to trace the fate of green fluorescent femoral artery smooth muscle cells following different types of surgery. Remarkably, our study showed that the cellular response is very different depending on whether surgical trauma is limited to a small area and vascular lumen or transects all arterial wall cell layers. In the first case smooth muscle cells respond by activation and cell division. In the latter case however the local smooth muscle cells die and are replaced by migratory adventitial cells. These results suggest that anti-proliferative drugs may impair the repair of arterial walls following anastomosis.
The established mouse model has enabled me to follow the fate of pericytes across mouse organs from early embryonic development to adulthood. Contrary to previous studies we did not detect skeletal muscle differentiation of CD146+NG2+ pericytes in embryonic development, postnatal muscle growth and in injury repair. We found evidence for limited osteogenic differentiation of pericytes, but no epithelial conversion in the intestine or lung. Comparative immunohistochemical analysis suggests great diversity among pericytes and adventitial cells in the microvasculature, highlighting the possibility that distinct cells may contribute differently to tissue regeneration.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29167274","56d492f62c6432.52860500","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=56d492f62c6432.52860500&grantRef=BB%2FM013170%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/M013170/1","78FDC7B4-50EC-43D3-A985-20A49BF4354B","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993","D59498C9-2EA3-4013-8DE2-F7AB9D4A9DF8"

It integrates advanced methods in statistics, spatial analysis and spatial epidemiology within an intuitive user interface requiring minimal training with exportable results. The two main functionalities of the RIF are:

• Risk analysis, which can determine whether a point or area source shows a statistical association with a health outcome in a local population.
• Disease mapping, which can visualise mortality or morbidity rates and spatial patterns of disease using smoothed and unsmoothed maps.

The RIF version 4.0 represents a substantial upgrade on the previous version 3.2, moving to open source software, new visuals and better integration with statistical packages R and R-INLA, good flexibility for study selection and easier data loading. Co-funding from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has helped develop the software so it can support both US and UK-based public health tracking activities.&quot;
The RIF redevelopment project seeks to produce a suite of interoperable software tools which continues SAHSU's support for disease mapping and risk analysis studies. The new RIF software will rely on the following free technologies: Java, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, PL/pgSQL, Javascript, PHP, HTML and R. A SQL Server port will be created for the CDC. The storage of health data in external databases (e.g. Oracle) will continue to be supported. Whilst started in 2015 - without continued monetary contribution to fund the continuation of creating RIF, the existence of this useful tool in its present and evolved status would not be possible.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","No","2015","The new RIF will combine epidemiological analysis with data extraction to allow users to formulate an hypothesis; perform initial exploratory analysis with the option of either exporting the study extract (health, population and covariate data) and/or the results data into another tool; or continuing the analysis using R.
In a RIF project, the database team will use the Data Loader tool to populate the RIF database with GIS, covariate, population and health data sets. Epidemiologists working on projects will then use the Study Submission Tool to create a data extraction request. Database managers can optionally use the Information Governance Tool to assess whether it is appropriate to extract and disclose the results to the project who requested them. For example, SAHSU will use the tool to determine whether results contain low cell counts that could identify individuals. Once their data sets have been approved, the RIF will run the study and epidemiologists will use the Viewer Web application to inspect their results.
The new RIF will be extensible supporting integration with complex dispersion models to quantify exposure, integration with external data sources (e.g. Importing of disease map areas) and R.

The fluid of interest is mixed with very small volumes (~1 pL) of a highly concentrated aqueous suspension of 1.02&micro;m fluorescent microspheres (Fluoresbrite&reg; YG Carboxylate Microspheres, Polysciences Inc.). Samples are then placed on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss AxioVert A1 Fl), which is equipped with an LED source (CoolLED pE-300 white) and a temperature controlling stage and mounted on an antivibration table to eliminate environmental noise. Videos are then recorded at 00X magnification with a long-distance objective (ZeissLD Plan-Neofluor 40x/0.6NA Corr) with an ultra high speed camera (Photron FASTCAM MINI UX100). Microspheres are tracked as they undergo Brownian motion using in-house Matlab code. From the frequency-dependent mean square displacements (MSD) it is possible to construct spectra of the viscoelastic moduli of the fluid of interest. Currently, using this setup we have been able to obtain spectra spanning more than 4 orders of magnitude of frequency (from 1 to 50000Hz). In the case of hemolymph (1) the sample is extracted from the specimen using a capillary previously seeded with the suspension of microspheres, and visualized directly on the capillary. To minimize optical distortions we used capillaries with a square cross-section (CM scientific). In the case of the fluid in the acoustic vesicle, the volume is too small (&Oslash;nL) to perform an extraction. To overcome this we have develop a protocol to perform microrheology in situ and in vivo. The suspension of microspheres is injected into the vesicle using a pneumatic microinjection system (PV830 Picopump, WPI). Capillaries are previously pulled using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Inc.). Each capillary was calibrated individual before its use by injecting the microspheres suspension within mineral oil and measuring the diameter of the droplets. The specimen is then placed under the microscope. The cuticle in these species is transparent enough that the fluorescent microspheres can be visualized through it.","Biological samples","","","No","2022","This is the first time, to our knowledge, that microrheological methods are applied to the study of insects. We are now obtaining the first measurements of the viscoelastic properties of fluids in live katydids.

Furthermore, we have unequivocally shown that the acoustic vesicle of the katydids Phlugis spp and Copiphora spp., who have highly evolved hearing systems, is not linked to the circulatory system of the organism. The in situ microrehology procedure we have developed will allow not just measuring average viscoselasticity moduli but also mapping of viscosity within the organ, assessment of anisotropy and characterization of fluid dynamics in response to acoustic stimuli.

The new technique (paper in preparation) allows the work to be transferred from designing a highly complex digital filter to designing a single cost function that can be based on physical requirements. The particle swarm optimization process then optimizes the control filter to produce the lowest possible cost, and therefore the best performing filter. 

This is advantageous, as the seismic and local environmental noise (such as wind and earthquakes) is non-stationary and is time-varying (e.g. gusts of wind). Before this technique, new filters that are more suited to different ground and wind conditions would have had to be created by hand, a process that takes between 10-100 hours to do, with the new optimization method, new data can be obtained and a new filter designed within minutes. With this new method, not only do the filters perform better, resulting in, at worst, a 10% reduction in the ground injection to the platforms (more reduction is better), but in some cases this results in a factor 2-3 less motion being injected into the platform. Since low-frequency motion due to the wind has been recently linked to a decrease in the observatories binary neutron star range, this means that by better optimising the platforms, of which the detector is based, then some of this lost range could be recovered, by using the technique to design a new filter, which takes approximately 5 minutes to run on a workstation. 

These filters have been tried out at the detector sites to some success and should be run in the future.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2017","The notable impact of this tool is that new control filters that have been designed using this tool are being trialed at gravitational wave detector sites improving the isolation performance.

Abstract - Developing high quality oats is constrained by a lack of information on the impact of genetic and environmental/management factors. Current knowledge on optimal nitrogen levels is insufficient and both greater oat yields and higher quality oats could be achieved. In this study, four winter oat varieties were grown in two locations in replicated nitrogen response trials. The oats were analysed with a rapid 15 minuteC18 UHPLC gradient in conjunction with full MS and data dependent analysis (DDA) MSn. The data were chromatographically aligned and deconvolved within XCMS online and peaks putatively identified based upon accurate mass-derived molecular formula matching to multiple databases. Data visualisation/reduction approaches were applied with PCA and a novel method, t-distributed stochastic neighbourhood embedding (t- SNE). t-NE showed a greater capability in detecting sample class clusters compared to variance capture oriented methods such as PCA, however since tSNE is based on a distance matrix, the significance loadings are not directly available. Therefore, a significance test known as ANOVA simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) was applied with multiple factors, oat variety, location and nitrogen level, being investigated. The identifications of the most significant ions have been obtained from the accurate mass data, as well as MS2 and MS3 spectra obtained from DDA-MSn. Considerations of the agronomic significance of the metabolite profiling results a long with correlations to the oats physical traits is currently ongoing.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2017","This has underpinned the submission of a paper based on the approach and there is interest from the major oat processing companies such as PepsiCo","http://karl-burgess.squarespace.com/s/SMN17_delegate_pack_online_6.pdf","5c77e5b120f114.45238076","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c77e5b120f114.45238076&grantRef=BB%2FM001237%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/M001237/1","86ACE9D2-7538-4EEC-BFA9-64D72BC6A842","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","E5A82D2C-5AD4-488A-ACFF-566345A5D6DA","937DEDAC-AB67-4100-8E38-70C6927B9981"

signatures. Because high sequencing costs limit current studies to small numbers of goodquality
samples, we propose a robust, cost- and time-effective method, called mutREAD, to
detect mutational signatures from small quantities of DNA, including degraded samples. We
show that mutREAD recapitulates mutational signatures identified by whole genome
sequencing, and will ultimately allow the study of mutational signatures in larger cohorts and,
by compatibility with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, in clinical settings.","Technology assay or reagent","","","Yes","2020","mutREAD is a cost effective and scalable method for the detection of mutational signatures in DNA samples. mutREAD produces reproducible and highly specific reduced representation libraries and the derived mutational signatures mirror the WGS-derived signatures high cosine similarity. Importantly, this also holds true even when used with highly degraded DNA samples. Our method will ultimately allow the study of mutational signatures in much larger cohorts and in clinical settings where FFPE-derived DNA samples are routinely collected. Applied to tumor samples from EAC patients, we showed that mutREAD outperforms the previously proposed methods WES and 10&times; sWGS. EAC is characterized by abundant somatic mutations, which are most prevalent in intergenic and intronic regions. The choice of library preparation methods to study
mutational signatures in other cancer types will depend on the overall mutation rate and the genomic distribution of the somatic mutations.

In terms of scalability and cost mutREAD outperforms other methods. In our hands, the cost associated with mutREAD libraries synthesis is 80% lower than for 10&times; sWGS and 96% lower than for WES libraries. Sequencing costs on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 are comparable for WES and mutREAD libraries, while sequencing 10&times; WGS libraries is at least three times more expensive. Further, due to its high multiplexing capabilities for sequencing and for library preparation mutREAD is highly scalable for studying larger cohorts. Given its ease of use and low cost, we envision a wide range of applications for mutREAD to study mutational signatures in basic
research and translational settings. For example, clinical trials using mutational signature-based patient stratification to assign optimal therapies become feasible. mutREAD could further improve the mutational signature-based prediction of homologous recombination deficiency in clinical samples14,26. Together with computational tools for coarse-grained copy alteration detection, mutREAD could provide a detailed view of the role of mutational processes in cancer progression and evolution from
archived material. Finally, correlative analyses of mutational signatures with endogenous and environmental parameters to understand the source of so far unknown mutational signatures will shed light on the etiology of cancers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16974-3","60479a0a127004.29757437","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=60479a0a127004.29757437&grantRef=MC_UU_12022%2F2","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MC_UU_12022/2","00CB19BB-7E41-4106-825F-5D5D8501FA55","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","7EA7E476-F8CD-4A75-9746-0058BEC86C92"

Studying site-specific amino acid frequencies by eye can reveal biologically significant variability and lineage-specific adaptation. This so-called 'sequence gazing' often informs bioinformatics and experimental research. But it is important to also account for the underlying phylogeny, since similarities may be due to common descent rather than selection pressure, and because it is important to distinguish between founder effects and convergent evolution. We set out to combine phylogenetic and sequence data to produce evolutionarily insightful visualisations.

Results
We present ChromaClade, a convenient tool with a graphical user-interface that works in concert with popular tree viewers to produce colour-annotated phylogenies highlighting residues found in each taxon and at each site in a sequence alignment. Colouring branches according to residues found at descendent tips also quickly identifies lineage-specific residues and those internal branches where key substitutions have occurred. We demonstrate applications of ChromaClade to human immunodeficiency virus and influenza A virus datasets, illustrating cases of conservative, adaptive and convergent evolution.

Conclusions
We find this to be a powerful approach for visualising site-wise residue distributions and detecting evolutionary patterns, especially in large datasets. ChromaClade is available for Windows, macOS and Unix or Linux; program executables and source code are available at github.com/chrismonit/chroma_clade.

Background
Visually inspecting molecular sequence data - so called 'sequence gazing' - can be extremely insightful. Sites that are evolutionarily conserved may be crucial for a protein's structure and function, while variation may indicate divergent selective constraints in separate groups. For molecular biologists these observations can inspire hypotheses to be tested by point mutation experiments that examine the functional effect of the differences, while for bioinformaticians they can motivate more formal computational analysis. The approach is vastly improved by taking account of the organisms' phylogenetic relationships, firstly because some sequences will be more similar due to common descent rather than evolutionary constraint and secondly because this helps identify evolutionary trends, such as characteristics gained or lost in particular clades. At present there is no convenient, automated way to visualise phylogenetic and sequence data simultaneously.

Implementation
ChromaClade annotates and colours taxon names in phylogenetic trees according to the residues found in the corresponding sequence alignment. For each site in an alignment, ChromaClade annotates taxon names with residue letter codes and a residue-specific hexadecimal red/green/blue colour code that can be recognised by popular tree viewers, such as FigTree [1] or Archaeopteryx [2]. The annotated trees, whose topologies are identical to the original, are saved to a single file to be loaded into the tree viewer, meaning the data for each site can be inspected by simply looking through the set of coloured trees in the viewer.

Residue-specific colouring can also be applied to branches whose descendent taxa have the same residue. This helps classify lineages by their unique amino acids and illustrates how deep within the phylogenetic history substitutions have arisen.

We generated an animal model that has high levels of mtDNA mutations and mitochondrial dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium, and shown that those crypts have undergone metabolic remodelling akin to the metabolic remodelling observed in intestinal cancer cells. When these cells are transformed the resulting tumours are grow more rapidly compared with tumours with normal mitochondrial function. Metabolomic analysis of tumour organoids derived from the mice show an upregulation of de novo serine synthesis and resistance to serine/glycine starvation. De novo serine synthesis is selected for during tumour progression to support cancer cell growth and proliferation, and our data show that normal ageing intestinal stem cells can undergo metabolic remodelling essentially priming them for tumour development. This work has been submitted to Nature.

We have also investigated the mechanism of clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations in human colonic epithelium across the life-course using a combination of biological techniques and computational modelling. These data showed that, unlike muscle and other post-mitotic tissues, random genetic drift was the likely mechanism underlying clonal expansion in colonic stem cells. We also revealed fundamental insights into colonic stem cell biology in normal ageing humans such as the number of functional stem cells (5-7) and the stem cell replacement rate (0.52 per year) (Stamp et al. 2018).
 
In addition, to try to explain the increased risk of colon cancer development in obese subjects, working across the Centre, we have measured mitochondrial function in human colonoscopic biopsies taken from obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery and compared them with non-obese controls. We have found that obese individuals have a significantly higher proportion of colonic crypts with mitochondrial dysfunction compared with controls showing that environmental factors can influence mitochondrial function within the intestine. We have also used an animal model to investigate the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction in intestinal epithelial cells on the gut microbiome. We showed significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in the presence of high levels of mtDNA mutations, and that endurance exercise was able to modulate some of these changes (Houghton et al. 2018)","Biological samples","","","No","2018","None yet",,"5c531779ba9916.59823966","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c531779ba9916.59823966&grantRef=MR%2FL016354%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MR/L016354/1","DB733AF9-F008-40D0-972F-FF66B386053B","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","5E2B04DD-4A03-45ED-9892-61C5CCB8AC68","C727E2B0-A636-4F29-9D0B-6D423A91FE19"

The domain covers the entire African continent and boundary region to allow representation of impinging systems such as tropical temperate troughs. The planned 10 years of present-day climate simulations (1997-2006) and 10 years of idealised future simulations (2097-2107) have now been completed. The model specification and initial analysis of results is now published in Stratton et al, 2018. Publications on design and analysis of the future simulations are imminent. For both present day and future simulations a control non-convection permitting regional simulation at 25km resolution (nCP25-Africa) is being run to measure the CP4-Africa benefits. Analysis of the present-day simulations shows marked benefits in CP4-Africa's simulation of African climate relative to the control. Marked differences in future simulations with the convection-permitting system relative to the conventional parameterised convection system are emerging that are of high importance to adaptation advice. These have been reported in other sections and notably include a greater increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall as well as increases in in-season dry spells.

The CP4-Africa and nCP25-Africa simulations have continued to be made widely available to the FCFA Regional Consortia (RCs) via the JASMIN facility. Access by researchers is working well.

This year plans have been developed with the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) to build a public-facing store of a limited subset of CP4-Africa data with easy access and no expiration. The full archive of CP4-Africa data will be stored indefinitely on MASS and will be available through JASMIN and MASS.

By passing the cell through the field of view of the imaging module before each solution exchange, the intracellular fluorescence changes, in response to a stimulus as well as pre- and post-stimulus are monitored by the imaging module.

The device combines essential features from both florescence activated flow cytometry and high-throughput microscopy, yet the development will allow to measure functional cellular phenotypes and conduct sorting based on these measurements. The FPFC bridges an important gap between currently available technologies and promises to have a major impact on associated research and industrial communities in the following ways: 
Applications are envisioned in the field of functional peptide, CRISPR-Cas based cell screens, RNA-i screens where a reporter gene gets over/under regulated upon encounter with a chemical or biological stimulus. A fluorescently-labelled binder has to be used to measure such responses. The reporter can also inform on the concentration of certain chemicals present in the cytoplasm (ion indicators, ATP, cAMP). 
In the field of Cell Biology, the proposed FPFC would provide a new method to sort living cells for further experiments allowing analysis when fluorescent antibodies that specifically target the cell surface of a target cellular type are lacking (this includes many variant human cells). This opens up a wide range of applications, such as preferentially recovering immune cells, parasites or cancer cells from tissue samples. Furthermore, these methods will complement current antibody technologies and will also provide cheaper and more efficient alternatives for sorting living cells.
In the field of Molecular Biology, the FPFC would facilitate the identification of genotype-phenotype and transcriptome-phenotype relationships. Particularly with the advent of single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing, the device could sort individual cells with a particular functional phenotype. Sorted cells could be further analysed with genomics and/or transcriptomics and relationships between their functional phenotype and their genome and/or transcriptome could be established. These types of studies could be used to highlight differences in cell populations in health and disease and thus provide valuable insights for medical research and the pharmaceutical industry. Similarly, when working with genetically labelled cell populations, single cell transcriptomics has revealed large heterogeneity among a cell type. Using the FPFC we can correlate the functional phenotype with the levels of RNA expression.
In the field of Stem Cell Biology, the proposed device could provide a method of assessing cell differentiation. Coupled with single cell transcriptomics the device will provide a powerful tool to determine population heterogeneity and help in the identification of target cells.
High-throughput phenotype screening is emerging as a field for revolutionary technological developments. The proposed device will uniquely allow researchers to measure changes in the functional phenotype of a cell upon exposure to environmental metabolites and other stimuli. High-throughput phenotype screening is a key and hugely underdeveloped field and requires focused technological development and the introduction of new commercial products.",,"5e68b317822d40.70226941","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5e68b317822d40.70226941&grantRef=BB%2FR022127%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/R022127/1","38840460-706A-43B5-ADC1-858BF79827A1","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","20BAB51B-BFF9-4B0B-8888-02E9D09CA4A6"

1.) Instruments and devises for the production of hyperpolarized gases have been developed and assembled. The technology is based on previous research at Colorado State University (CSU) and on recent developments in Nottingham. Almost the complete previous laboratory was relocated (free of charge except transportation) from Colorado to the University of Nottingham. Major items include: a.) one already assembled hyperpolarization devise and parts for a partially assembled second system, b.) a gas delivery system including vacuum unit, gas mixing, peristaltic pumps, high purity filtration. c.) a 9.4 T superconducting magnet (89 mm vertical bore) for micro imaging and NMR spectroscopy d.) A microimaging gradient system including amplifiers and gradient coils. e.) 0 - 3 T superconducting magnet (89 mm vertical bore) for field cycling (i.e. field dependent noble gas relaxation measurements), including charging system to allow for the field ramping. f.) Various glassware specifically designed for the experiments. g.) Various NMR/MRI probe heads for work with hyperpolarized noble gases. 
The the laboratory equipment from Colorado was moved to the UK, temporarily stored, refitted where needed (different electrical, and gas delivery requirement, different usage compared to previous) and further assembled. New develpments have been made in improving the hyperpolarization of the MRI contrast agents. 

2.) Acquisition of new equipment. The following major items have been purchased: a.) a state-of-the-art 9.4T Microimaging system from Bruker with 'ultrashielded' magnet . This system will be a primary research instrumentation in the translational imaging laboratory. It will also allow for flow (blood flow) measurements in model systems and for rheological NMR experiments. The system includes a variety of radio frequency coils for detection. The system is currently been tested and a number of items have been returned for modification b.) A low cost console for the second 9.4 T MRI system and existing microimaging system (both transfers from Colorado). The magnet has been energized to 9.4 T initially but can be ramped to any field below this value if needed. The system will also allow for optical pumping in the stray-field of the unshielded magnet. c.) A Rheo-meter to complement the Bruker Rheological NMR system (still in purchasing the processes). 

3.) Development and construction of MRI Coils for hyperpolarized xenon-129 and krypton-83 for 7.4 T small animal imaging system at the University of Nottingham Brain and Body Centre and for 3 T whole body Philips MRI system (still in process). 

4.) Hiring of personnel: one post-graduate student has joined in January 2010 and a second post graduate student has joined in September 2010. A post doctoral researcher has joined in April 2010. A lecturer has joined University of Nottingham who will be crucial for the Rheological and blood flow work. A further post graduate student (with medical doctorate degee) has joined the group in April 2011. 

5.) Planning of major reconstruction of Lab space at the Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance Centre to accommodate the vertical bore microimaging systems. Although the actual construction is not part of this grant, planning from the on-set because this work is crucial from the infrastructure point of view. Because of too low ceiling height at the centre major reconstruction within the existing building was necessary. The planning allowed for significant extra laboratory space within the existing building. Work was completed in early April 2010.

6.) A new hyperpolarizer system has been successfully developed in 2011 that allows for the production of hp xenon-129 and krypton-83 without cryogenic separation. A publication is currently pending and the system is in used of work with excised lungs where it has produced first pulmonary MR images of excised rodent lungs. A second system is currently been revised to produce larger quantities of hp gas for pulmonary MRI.

7.) Transverse relaxation measurements of hp xenon-129 and krypton-83 have produced new insights in the relaxation behavior of the gases in confined porous models systems and lungs. The work is currently ongoing.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2011","Using the hyperpolarizer system described in 6.) lung studies have been initiated in animal models of pulmonary disease.

The Recombinase Polymerase Assay (RPA) is an isothermal DNA amplification assay that employs enzymes, known as recombinases, which are capable of pairing oligonucleotide primers with homologous sequence in duplex DNA. Through this method, DNA synthesis is directed to defined points in a sample DNA. If the target sequence is indeed present, DNA amplification reaction is initiated; no other sample manipulation such as thermal or chemical melting is required. The reaction progresses rapidly and results in specific DNA amplification from just a few target copies to detectable levels typically within 3 - 10 minutes. The entire reaction system is stable as a dried formulation and can be transported safely without refrigeration. It is set to become a feasible point-of-care molecular diagnostic assay to be used in resource limited areas. 

The RPA for Giardia spp. proposed in this project is amplifying sequences from the ß-giardin gene. A specific FAM-labelled probe and biotin-labelled primer are used to generate an amplicon at 37&deg;C, resulting in a specific, dual-labelled product; this can be monitored visually via its binding to a biotin ligand on a lateral flow strip with concurrent gold-labelled anti-FAM detection. 

Research Methods employed for this work
The RPA protocol previously published (Cranell et al 2016) was found to yield an excess of false positives with negative controls. This problem was partly overcome with a change of the DNA extraction kit, the addition of betaine to the mastermix to prevent spurious products and the use of an alternate lateral flow cassette in place of the strips. The modified RPA was further applied to identify ß-giardin sequences from trophozoite-extracted DNA confirmed by sequencing and further refined by using Giardia duodenalis inactivated cysts (H3 isolate, Waterborne Inc, New Orleans , USA) spiking negative stool samples.

For field validation, 375 children were screened for Giardia by stool sample in villages along Lake Albert Uganda. Rapid diagnostic assays for Giardia duodenalis (Giardia/Crypto Quick Check; Techlab,VA, USA) were performed in the field. DNA extraction and RPA assay were performed in a sub-set of samples (N=15). The RPA assay performed optimally in a small set of samples ran in the field. DNA extraction procedures had to be further refined at LSHTM where further stool samples (extraction n=219; RPA n=36) obtained from Uganda were run and compared to qPCR as the for Giardia assemblage detection.

Results
20% of all the samples run were positive for Giardia RPA compared to 26 % by qPCR, showing promise for the new molecular diagnostic assay. Further analysis is also ongoing to explore the correlation between the RPA and the available RDT. We found the RPA feasible to run in low resource settings. 

Additionally, in conjunction with the NHM we are developing methods of multiplexing assays to characterize the assemblage(s) of Giardia duodenalis from infected people, and from environmental sampling, to further understand clinical associations and natural cycles of transmission of the various assemblages. Going forward, we intend to devise a multiplex test of Giardia duodenalis and Schistosoma mansoni, which are co-endemic.
.","Technology assay or reagent","","","No","","Rapid diagnosis and treatment
G. lamblia genotype-specific RPA will allow access to prompt diagnosis and treatment of children harbouring light and moderate infections not currently detected by available methods. The ability to detect genotypes associated with negative health outcomes will have its highest applicability in field surveys. It also has the potential to be used in institutional outbreaks where G. lamblia is known to occur (Baque et al., 2011). The development of a new genotype-specific RPA Giardia assay can be used and adopted by many groups across institutions nationally (LSHTM, LSTM) as well as internationally. The internal and external validation of the proposed work will be essential in technology transfer for a generalized use. Comparison for test validity against real-time PCR will produce robust sensitivity and specificity outcomes of the test that can act as reference for further use. 

Feasibility of use in low-resource settings
RPA is a validated assay used for the detection of different pathogens (Rosser et al., 2015). The recombinase polymerase reaction can take place at an ambient temperature (Krolov et al., 2014), reagents are lyophilized making its use feasible in extreme temperatures. DNA amplification can be detected by visual reading of lateral flow (LF) strips, allowing flexibility in resource limited settings (Kersting et al, 2014).

New endpoint for clinical trials
There are ongoing trials to develop a single dose treatment that would mainstream treatment and allow mass drug administration for G. lamblia. Real-time PCR is the most sensitive test of cure, but limitations include high cost, skilled personnel, and reagents that need refrigeration. Infection clearance by POC-RPA has the potential to become a new endpoint for drug trials.","http://www.twistdx.co.uk/","5898d73f4a40d7.91804432","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5898d73f4a40d7.91804432&grantRef=MC_PC_15040","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MC_PC_15040","58D5CE6A-81E2-4995-B56C-8B7C69D8E351","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3ED60B49-9C2B-4D71-B644-96CCC7F10194","35C0CE50-61C8-4951-A6BD-C121ABC82F8E"

One cannot research design and designers without a formal analysis of their work. This analysis is both archival and empirical, and is primarily concerned with design drawings and built designs, although texts by the architects themselves addressing design intentions are also important. The analysis falls into two basic categories, production and reception.
 
PRODUCTION OF DESIGN (archival)
1 spatial analysis of architects' concept drawings of the case studies, and any texts they produced about their original interpretations of the brief.
2 spatial analysis of architects' design development: design iterations in response to various constraints - client views, planning regs, budget restrictions, evolving understanding of the site/brief and of their own initial intentions.
 
RECEPTION OF ARTEFACT (empirical)
1 spatial analysis of public spaces themselves
a) in comparison with architects' design intentions (as represented in their drawings/ texts) 
b) as used by public now (circulation in, through and around at different times of day and year/urban context/programming/popularity/popularity with whom for what etc.)

It is a measure of the complexities of empirical research that beginning it requires some idea of the end of it, while at the same time one must affect not to know the end of it. When starting, it was therefore useful to make a distinction between knowing the subject of the research project, and knowing its object. It was clear, even when writing the AHRC funding application, that within the constraints of the subject - the role of the architect in the production of public space during the period of High Modernism and now in London and Sao Paulo - we would be seeing what emerged as the object, with as small and self-aware an a priori agenda as possible. Nevertheless, even such a seemingly simple distinction between knowing one's subject matter and knowing one's purpose required qualification: for a start, what did we mean by 'production'? by 'public space'? by 'High Modernism'? by 'now'? Was an example of public space conceived of in the 1960s but not realised until the 1990s an example of 'then' or 'now'? Was an example designed and built in the 1950s excluded from a 'High Modernism' defined by the emergence of Brutalism in the UK in the 1960s and 70s? Were we looking for stand-alone public spaces designed by architects or building/public space ensembles? 

FORMS OF DISCOURSE
In addition to the social science-dominated academic discourse on public space, there are two fundamental types of architectural discourse. The first is by writers and practitioners within architecture about architecture, particularly the conversation architecture has with its past, and the references practitioners can make in their own work to aspects of that past. A crude example would be architectural post-Modernism as a reaction against the architectural Modernism that preceded it. The second type of architectural discourse views architecture as part of a social and political narrative - a symptom, a projection, an embodiment - and is written by those outside as well as inside architecture. These commentators can be Marxist (eg David Harvey) or neo-Liberal (eg Alice Coleman) or environmental (eg Simon Guy) or critically historical (eg Mark Swenarton), but they are all characterised by the framing of architecture within larger socio-political contexts. 

In order to fully recognise the role of design in this project, we must look architecture as an autonomous discourse, and in order to fully understand the role of the architect, we must look at it within a much larger socio-political context. We must look, in other words, at the connections between aesthetics and politics. 

A PARTIALLY REVERSIBLE START
Certain decisions had to be made at the time of the application. As doctrinaire architectural Modernism is known, or perhaps caricatured, by the idea of the tabula rasa - the context-less field within which its precious objects are set - it made sense to look at this idea as it was built. This meant addressing the building/public space ensemble. Or at least addressing it in London. There was, it turned out, a great difference between public space design in London and in Sao Paulo. In London, we could find no realised designs for stand-alone squares. In Sao Paulo, however, there are a surprising number. The European tradition of the urban square, having taken root with the Portuguese colonisers, continued to flourish during Brazilian Modernism as it had flourished before it. This continuity was unexpected, but perhaps not surprising, as Sao Paulo did not have the same forced erasure and urgent replacement to contend with that blitzed London did during the same period. 

So what was a dominant criterion for choosing examples to study in London - the public spaces formed by buildings - was much less so in Sao Paulo. It was clear that a range of examples in Sao Paulo, some stand-alone public spaces, some part of a building/public space ensemble, would have to be chosen. It was also clear that High Modernism in Sao Paulo, if characterised by Brutalism (as in beton brut and a 'truth to materials' and structure), in fact emerged earlier there than it did in London. There are fully fledged Brutalist buildings from the Sao Paulo school in the 1950s, making our 'High Modernist' chronology (the 1960s and 70s) valid only for London, not both cities. Already one can see that differences, and with them a more nuanced understanding, are emerging from observation and information gathering. Although the observation and information gathering were given direction from the subject matter, we had no initial hypothesis to prove or disprove. A version of 'Grounded Theory' (see below), which, as a research method, is of particular usefulness to designers and design historians, who are looking at objects-in-the-world and processes-in-the-world, as well as texts. 

The subject matter itself arose from a perceived lack of public space discourse from a design and a designer's perspective. Even the spatial aspects of public space have been dominated by geography and social science, disciplines that have made an enormous contribution to understanding the production and evolution of public space, but which aren't equipped to look at spatial formation from the point of view of designing it, and all the social/political/cultural baggage that the act of design brings with it. 

To this end, a set of categories were established that the final choice of case studies would be required to address: ideology/production/design/reception. Ideology covered both the political position of clients and architects, their conceptions of architectural Modernism and, when they thought about it at all, the nature of the 'public'. Production covered the client/architect relationship, the social, political and physical context, the programme/brief/budget etc. Design covered design intentions and outcomes, re-design or subsequent interventions, typological innovation, materials/environmental conditions/use etc. Reception covered positive and negative reactions to the work, from the architectural establishment and the general public, then and now.

One cannot research design and designers without a formal analysis of their work. This analysis is both archival and empirical, and is primarily concerned with design drawings and built designs, although texts by the architects themselves addressing design intentions are also important. The analysis falls into two basic categories, production and reception.
 
PRODUCTION OF DESIGN (archival)
1 spatial analysis of architects' concept drawings of the case studies, and any texts they produced about their original interpretations of the brief.
2 spatial analysis of architects' design development: design iterations in response to various constraints - client views, planning regs, budget restrictions, evolving understanding of the site/brief and of their own initial intentions.
 
RECEPTION OF ARTEFACT (empirical)
1 spatial analysis of public spaces themselves
a) in comparison with architects' design intentions (as represented in their drawings/ texts) 
b) as used by public now (circulation in, through and around at different times of day and year/urban context/programming/popularity/popularity with whom for what etc.)

It is a measure of the complexities of empirical research that beginning it requires some idea of the end of it, while at the same time one must affect not to know the end of it. When starting, it was therefore useful to make a distinction between knowing the subject of the research project, and knowing its object. It was clear, even when writing the AHRC funding application, that within the constraints of the subject - the role of the architect in the production of public space during the period of High Modernism and now in London and Sao Paulo - we would be seeing what emerged as the object, with as small and self-aware an a priori agenda as possible. Nevertheless, even such a seemingly simple distinction between knowing one's subject matter and knowing one's purpose required qualification: for a start, what did we mean by 'production'? by 'public space'? by 'High Modernism'? by 'now'? Was an example of public space conceived of in the 1960s but not realised until the 1990s an example of 'then' or 'now'? Was an example designed and built in the 1950s excluded from a 'High Modernism' defined by the emergence of Brutalism in the UK in the 1960s and 70s? Were we looking for stand-alone public spaces designed by architects or building/public space ensembles? 

FORMS OF DISCOURSE
In addition to the social science-dominated academic discourse on public space, there are two fundamental types of architectural discourse. The first is by writers and practitioners within architecture about architecture, particularly the conversation architecture has with its past, and the references practitioners can make in their own work to aspects of that past. A crude example would be architectural post-Modernism as a reaction against the architectural Modernism that preceded it. The second type of architectural discourse views architecture as part of a social and political narrative - a symptom, a projection, an embodiment - and is written by those outside as well as inside architecture. These commentators can be Marxist (eg David Harvey) or neo-Liberal (eg Alice Coleman) or environmental (eg Simon Guy) or critically historical (eg Mark Swenarton), but they are all characterised by the framing of architecture within larger socio-political contexts. 

In order to fully recognise the role of design in this project, we must look architecture as an autonomous discourse, and in order to fully understand the role of the architect, we must look at it within a much larger socio-political context. We must look, in other words, at the connections between aesthetics and politics. 

A PARTIALLY REVERSIBLE START
Certain decisions had to be made at the time of the application. As doctrinaire architectural Modernism is known, or perhaps caricatured, by the idea of the tabula rasa - the context-less field within which its precious objects are set - it made sense to look at this idea as it was built. This meant addressing the building/public space ensemble. Or at least addressing it in London. There was, it turned out, a great difference between public space design in London and in Sao Paulo. In London, we could find no realised designs for stand-alone squares. In Sao Paulo, however, there are a surprising number. The European tradition of the urban square, having taken root with the Portuguese colonisers, continued to flourish during Brazilian Modernism as it had flourished before it. This continuity was unexpected, but perhaps not surprising, as Sao Paulo did not have the same forced erasure and urgent replacement to contend with that blitzed London did during the same period. 

So what was a dominant criterion for choosing examples to study in London - the public spaces formed by buildings - was much less so in Sao Paulo. It was clear that a range of examples in Sao Paulo, some stand-alone public spaces, some part of a building/public space ensemble, would have to be chosen. It was also clear that High Modernism in Sao Paulo, if characterised by Brutalism (as in beton brut and a 'truth to materials' and structure), in fact emerged earlier there than it did in London. There are fully fledged Brutalist buildings from the Sao Paulo school in the 1950s, making our 'High Modernist' chronology (the 1960s and 70s) valid only for London, not both cities. Already one can see that differences, and with them a more nuanced understanding, are emerging from observation and information gathering. Although the observation and information gathering were given direction from the subject matter, we had no initial hypothesis to prove or disprove. A version of 'Grounded Theory' (see below), which, as a research method, is of particular usefulness to designers and design historians, who are looking at objects-in-the-world and processes-in-the-world, as well as texts. 

The subject matter itself arose from a perceived lack of public space discourse from a design and a designer's perspective. Even the spatial aspects of public space have been dominated by geography and social science, disciplines that have made an enormous contribution to understanding the production and evolution of public space, but which aren't equipped to look at spatial formation from the point of view of designing it, and all the social/political/cultural baggage that the act of design brings with it. 

To this end, a set of categories were established that the final choice of case studies would be required to address: ideology/production/design/reception. Ideology covered both the political position of clients and architects, their conceptions of architectural Modernism and, when they thought about it at all, the nature of the 'public'. Production covered the client/architect relationship, the social, political and physical context, the programme/brief/budget etc. Design covered design intentions and outcomes, re-design or subsequent interventions, typological innovation, materials/environmental conditions/use etc. Reception covered positive and negative reactions to the work, from the architectural establishment and the general public, then and now. 
 Choices of public space case studies thus had to cover public and private sector clients; public and private sector architects; a range of programmes - commercial, civic, retail, arts; a range of scales; spaces successful (popular) then/spaces successful later; designs with realised intentions/designs with thwarted intentions; innovative typologies and more traditional typologies.

"EPSRC","EP/D078784/1","Research Grant","Research Tools and Methods","Royal College of Art","Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design","Myerson","Jeremy","","Tools for designers","Cambridge Engineering Design Centre produced a range of tools to help designers put inclusive design into practice, hosted on the website www.inclusivedesign.toolkit.com. These include a Demand Assessment Grid, which assesses the vision, hearing, thinking, mobility and dexterity demands associated with each of the steps required when interacting with a product; Impairment Simulation Tools such as gloves and glasses that enable designers to experience the effects of visual and physical impairment for themselves; and an Exclusion Calculator that quantifies the proportion of the UK population that would be unable to use a product.

A particular focus of i~design 3 was on evaluating products and services through Exclusion Audits. These were developed through a series of experiments and examine the demands a product places on users' capabilities - for example, a mobile telephone may have small buttons requiring a certain level of dexterity to operate. The Exclusion Calculator guides designers through the process of conducting an Exclusion Audit and estimates the percentage of the UK population who would be unable to use the product due to its demands. 

Work on the Exclusion Calculator involved developing and testing algorithms for the underlying calculations, and reanalysing the population data so that it is more suitable for design purposes. The Exclusion Calculator is, however, limited by the data that is currently available, so the i~design team developed a pilot survey to produce a more suitable database. 

A team from Loughborough Design School at Loughborough University investigated the extent to which everyday contexts of use impact on the way people use products. Context of use refers to the circumstances in which a product interaction takes place and can include factors such as lighting levels, temperature, weather conditions, vibration, noise, assistance from other people, a person's mood, and so on. 

Early in the project, focus groups and observations with older people helped to identify situations where context has the biggest impact upon product use. The team explored people's feelings and motivations, the nature of their everyday tasks and both the physical and social environments in which they interacted with products. These terms formed the basis of a Context Framework, which illustrates the multi-faceted impact of context upon user capabilities and product demands. 

Two experiments were conducted with older people aged 65 and over to determine what effect the physical environment has on two key product interaction capabilities - vision and dexterity. For vision, four everyday lighting levels were investigated (daylight, overcast, in-house lighting and street lighting) with older users reading different letter size and contrast combinations. Findings from this experiment demonstrated the importance of considering ambient illumination when designing everyday products. 

For dexterity, neutral (19&deg;C-24&deg;C) and everyday cold temperatures (5&deg;C) were investigated. Findings from the dexterity study indicated that grip strength (power and pinch grip) is not affected by 5&deg;C cold temperatures. However, fine finger dexterity is significantly reduced when a person is exposed to this average winter temperature. 

The experimental data was developed into a design tool called the Context Calculator and iteratively tested with designers to ensure its usefulness and usability. This tool provides data on older adults' capabilities in a range of environmental conditions related to everyday lighting conditions and cold winter temperatures. 

The RCA research team in the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design worked closely with colleagues at Cambridge and Loughborough to turn their scientific findings into practical resources for designers. A key objective was to bring hard capability data alive for the design profession in an empathic and meaningful way. This research was consolidated in an open-access web-based resource that explores the current shift from designing for people to designing with people, www.designingwithpeople.org, aims to offer a wealth of practical information on inclusive design practice. 

The website has four main sections. A People section presents 10 individuals drawn from the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design's user network - their vision, hearing, dexterity, mobility and cognition capabilities correspond to different scales on Cambridge University's population capability data and their life experiences can act as an inspiration for designers. 
An Activities section uses the centre's extensive track record of inclusive design projects to present precedents and case studies related to the activities of daily living. Insights on user behaviour are grouped under four themes - Personal Care, Household, Work &amp; Money and Communication - and communicated via images, video and first-person testimonial. Loughborough's Context Framework is presented here. 
A Methods section maps and evaluates common design methods in practice and classifies them within a special framework. Designers can browse exemplar projects related to each method and identify the most appropriate method for their current project. Finally, an Ethics section offers designers guidance on good practice in working with people. Designers can work through the stages of contact, consent, confidentiality and conduct step-by-step in order to understand the principles of user involvement.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2011","The designing with people website consolidating the i-design tools for designers has been widely accessed across design education in the UK and internationally.

The eddy-current effect is a form of electromagnetic induction which may be utilised to measure the distance to a conductive object. A coil is excited by and AC current to generate an alternating magnetic field, which induces eddy currents in nearby conductive targets. These currents generate an opposing magnetic field, in accordance with Lenz's law, which cancels a part of the applied field and reduces the coil flux. This field coupling between the coil and conductive target acts to increase the coil's resistance, and reduce the observed inductance. As the target moves closer to the coil, the increased alternating field increases the eddy-current density causing a further decrease in inductance. This change in inductance may be calibrated to the distance between the coil and target, giving a displacement sensor which is highly resistant to environmental effects.
 
To capture all types of motion at the taper interface, this study employed four sensing coils on a single custom PCB (P&amp;M Services ltd, UK), allowing for 4 degrees of freedom measurement of the motion. The coils were mounted to the male component below the taper interface and aluminium targets were mounted on the femoral head. Three coils were used to calculate the vector of a plane which allowed pistoning and toggling in two axes to be determined. A fourth coil perpendicular to the other three was used to measure rotation.

Texas Instruments (USA) coil and LDC design tools was were used to guide sensor design 63. Each coil comprised of two layers, each with 16 turns, 100 &micro;m (or 4 mil) spacing between turn and 200 &micro;m (8 mil) between layers, 100 &micro;m trace width, an outer diameter of 10 mm and external capacitance of 330 pf. The coils were driven and monitored using a fully integrated, 4-channel inductance to digital converter chip (LDC 1614, Texas Instruments, US). The digital output of the LDC 1614 was then sent to a microcontroller (myRIO, National Instruments, US) via I2C protocol and inductance was recorded at 100 Hz. Raw inductances were then calculated and stored as a .txt file using a bespoke LabView (2019, National Instruments, US) program for export into Matlab (R2020a, MathWorks, US). A bespoke, Matlab program was developed for the conversion of inductance to displacements and the different motions i.e. pistoning, toggling and rotation.

The sensors were calibrated using a piezo linear precision positioner stage (MikroMove, Physik Instruments, UK) accurate to 0.1 nm. This included fixing the aluminium target to the precision positioner stage and moving it relative to the coil board which was fixed to a spare male component. Coil 4 was calibrated separately before soldering into position. Calibration curves were determined across the full range of target-coil distances. Three separate sets of calibration data were then used to test the determined inductance-to-displacements relationships. Residuals from the three sets of data indicate that the sensing solution was found to be accurate to &plusmn; 0.5 &micro;m.

Four coils were used to capture all the different types of motion, including: pistoning, toggling YX, toggling XZ and Rotation. The x and y coordinates of the three points were defined in the coordinate system by the centre of each coil. The z coordinate was the measured target-coil distance.

Pistoning was determined by first calculating two vectors in the plane (VAB and VAC using three points A, B and C). The second step was to determine the normal (n) to the plane by taking the cross product of these two vectors (Equation 1). Thirdly, the perpendicular distance (d) from the origin to the plane was determined by taking the dot product of the normal and a point on the plane (Equation 2).

n = VABAB VAC
Equation 1

d = A . n
Equation 2

Toggling YZ was found by first determining the angle the plane, at each sampling point, made with Y axis in the YZ plane i.e. rotation about the x-axis (sx, Equation 3). Likewise, Toggling XZ was found by determining the angle the plane, at each sampling point, made with X axis in the XZ plane i.e. rotation about the y-axis (sy, Equation 4). Each rotation was converted to an equivalent displacement at the taper surface assuming a radius (r) of 7 mm using Equation 5 and Equation 6}.

x=90-cos-1n.jn j
 Equation 3

y=90-cos-1n.in i
Equation 4

Toggling YZ = r tan(x)
Equation 5

Toggling XZ = r tan(y)
Equation 6

Rotation was calculated by use of a fourth coil perpendicular to coils 1 to 3. Once the inductance was converted to a displacement, this was then used to calculate a rotation angle using a radius distance from the centre of coil 4 to the z-axis. The displacement at the taper interface was then calculated as the arc length assuming a radius of 7 mm and the rotation angle derived from the coil. Each subsequent rotation displacement was subtracted from the first calculated value of rotation for relative position with respect to the start of the experiment.

All motions calculated from this study were subtracted from an equivalent monoblock to allow the removal of any elastic deformation measured from the test samples. The monoblock was a sample that was assembled to a high force of 8 kN and welded at the taper opening.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2021","EPSRC IAA with MatOrtho - Streamlining preclinical assessment

However, the procedure shows technical weakness because of the chemical and physical treatments required for sample processing before imaging. Here we describe a revisited protocol to obtain high-resolution images of human bone marrow trephine biopsies, improving the antigen-antibody recognition and preserving the morphology and the architecture of the bone marrow microenvironment.

Introduction
The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche is an anatomical and functional microenvironment where HSCs are maintained in an undifferentiated and self-renewing state and receive stimuli that determine their fate [1]. Several cellular components of the HSC niche such as mesenchymal cells, endothelial cells, perivascular stromal cells, nerves belonging to the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), nonmyelinating Schwann cells, adipocytes, osteolineage cells, structural components of the extracellular matrix, ions (Calcium, Magnesium and phosphate), vesicles, cytokines, chemokines, hormones and growth factors influence HSC self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation or migration [2-4]. Given this complexity, studying the HSC niche requires choosing optimal strategies for sample preparation and imaging to evaluate the expression and the localization of proteins [5-9]. Immunofluorescence on tissue sections represents one of the most amenable techniques which has been very powerful to study mouse HSC niches using cryopreserved samples. However, cryoblocks are rarely available for human samples since these samples are routinely fixed with formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological examination and diagnostic procedures. Unfortunately, this processing limits the capacity to detect antigens in paraffinized human samples [10,5]. In fact, tissue treated with aldehyde fixatives and included in hydrocarbon compounds show less antigenicity and generate autofluorescence and/or background fluorescence which decrease the quality of the final result. Antigenic heat-mediated exposure or unmasking of antigens can improve the quality of the antigen-antibody reaction, but tends to damage thin bone marrow [11]. Microwave heating methods alternating heating intervals can sometimes yield better results. The antibody washing steps are particularly relevant to reduce the background noise, especially in the case of samples pre-treated with signal enhancers. 
One key advantage of paraffin inclusion of the specimen is its long storage, which allows retrospective clinical examination. The availability of these samples is becoming increasingly on demand to understand the pathological alterations of the human bone marrow microenvironment. Accomplishing this goal requires in-depth knowledge of the physiopathological human bone marrow architecture, but our knowledge in this regards is very limited compared with the information generated in the mouse system. Post-diagnostic paraffinized human bone marrow (trephine) biopsies could represent an invaluable source to increase our knowledge of the human bone marrow. For this reason, we describe here a protocol that allows multicolor staining of thin human bone marrow sections for high resolution fluorescence imaging. Briefly, after dewaxing samples are maintained always hydrated by using washing buffers (D-PBS and 0.5% Triton-X 100). Antigen retrieval is carried out by heating in a bain-marie three times (7'+4'+4') with steps of thermal shocks. Non-specific fluorescence (background), which is a commonly issue when applying fluorescent conjugates to paraffinized sections, is largely eliminated by using glycine, washing sections three times (after antigen antibodies reactions) and separating the incubations of secondary antibodies. These optimized critical steps and examples of the resulting images (Figure 1) are described below in detail.

18. Wash slides three times for 2 min each in D-PBS. 
19. Repeat point 17 for each secondary antibody.
20. Wash slides three times for 2 min each in D-PBS. 
21. Prepare nuclear staining solution. Add 100-200 &micro;l to each section and incubate at RT (See Note 10).
22. Remove the staining solution and wash sections three times for 2 min each in D-PBS. 
23. Discard D-PBS and wipe carefully around the sections. Drop 26 &micro;l of aqueous mounting medium supplemented with anti-fade reagent. Avoid bubbles and excessive mounting medium. Place a clean coverslip on the section and apply pressure gently using tweezers.
24. Seal off the slides using nail polish. From that moment the slides are ready for imaging (See Note 11).
NOTES
1. Alternatively, dry tissue sections at 37 &deg;C for 48 h.
2. This is a pause point. Samples can be stored in distillated water at RT for about 3 hours.
3. Alternatively, heat samples at 750-800 W for 3 min, reduce microwave power (400 W) and continue to heat samples for 12 min. Monitor carefully and add more buffer if it evaporates. Antigen retrieval breaks methylene bridge cross-links formed between proteins during formaldehyde-mediated fixation. Salt concentration and pH of retrieval buffer solutions should be evaluated to guarantee cross-bridge removal. The use of tissue-adhesive coated (poly-L-lysine coated) slides is strongly recommended because the antigenic unmasking is a critical step that can nevertheless cause detachment and damage of the tissue sections. Avoid boiling of the solution to prevent this. 
4. Alternatively, PAP pen can be used to draw margins, as far as enough space is allowed between margins and the section. From this step on do not let the sections dehydrate.
5. Drop solutions slowly to the tissue sections in order to prevent damage to the sections. Liquids should be pipetted adjacent to the tissue sections forming drops. It is recommended to create drops of solution on the surface of the sample and avoid overspill.
6. Glycine reduces background fluorescence by binding to free aldehyhyde groups, possibly reducing the fluorescent signal of secondary antibodies. Commercially-available signal enhancer solutions can be directly applied on the tissue section (drop 26 &micro;l) to increase the fluorescent intensity. If used, avoid mixing with other solutions (blocking solutions) and wash well in D-PBS.
7. Normal serum helps to prevent cross-reaction between the secondary antibody and endogenous immunoglobulins present in the tissue. Normal serum should be from the same species as the secondary antibody. For instance, for a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, normal goat serum should be used as blocking reagent. BSA has the same purpose to reduce nonspecific binding by blocking hydrophobic binding sites in the tissue.
8. The primary antibody needs to derive from a species different from the sample. Antibody dilution and incubation time should be optimized for each antibody. Generally, overnight incubation (4 &deg;C) is preferred to ensure that all specific antigens have reached their saturation point. Protect the slides from light when using fluochrome-conjugated antibodies.
9. The fluorochromes used should match the excitation and detection spectra of the microscope system used. The power of light should be adjusted to avoid photobleaching the sample. The excitation and the emission of secondary antibodies should be spanned to avoid spectrum overlapping. For multicolor immunofluorescence, we suggest to check the match with the primary antibody animal species. Avoid using more than one secondary antibody raised in the same animal species to avoid signal overlapping and false-positive signal co-localization. The co-incubation of secondary antibodies is possible but not encouraged. Spin down (4 &deg;C) the diluted antibody before use to reduce molecules aggregates that could disturb the signal. 
10. Nuclear staining can be performed by using DNA intercalating dyes 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or TO-PRO-3. Check excitation and emission of DNA intercalating dyes to create a good match with the secondary antibodies. Incubation time and dilution factor are specified on the product's datasheet. The use of nuclear staining is strongly encouraged to help identify cells.
11. Leave to dry the slides before the imaging session. Store slides at 4&deg;C and protect from light to avoid photobleaching.

SAMHD1 animal model

Background

In 2009 we identified mutations in SAMHD1 to cause one of the seven subtypes of Aicardi-Gouti&egrave;res syndrome (AGS), a genetically determined encephalopathy associated with an upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) [1]. Clinically, SAMHD1-related AGS differs from other AGS subtypes in that many patients demonstrate a cerebral vasculopathy and are prone to intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and stroke [2-4]. The pathological basis of this phenotype is predicted to relate to a discrete role for SAMHD1 in neurovascular homeostasis - likely through an immune/inflammatory-mediated mechanism. The immune function of SAMHD1 has been the subject of intense study; however, an understanding of its role in the neurovasculature remains unclear. Mutant SAMHD1 mice have been generated, but these mice do not exhibit neurovascular disease [5, 6]. In contrast, using an antisense morpholino approach, we published a temporal samhd1 gene knockdown zebrafish embryo model, apparently recapitulating the cerebrovascular and innate immune phenotypes observed in AGS [7]. Morpholinos cannot integrate into the genome, so that permanent genetic modification is impossible using this strategy. Thus, for long-term investigation a genetically stable mutant samhd1 model is necessary, and the development of such has been the main focus of our ERA-NET funded work in Manchester. Although this theme was not originally envisaged as part of the ERA-NET application, we considered that the possibility to derive an animal model recapitulating the neuro-inflammatory features associated with the human disease due to SAMHD1 mutations could be fully justified within the remit of the NEURO-IFN grant. 

Considering the insights that a zebrafish animal model of inflammatory cerebrovascular disease might afford, we decided to develop a stable loss of function SAMHD1 system. Three mutant samhd1 lines are now available in Manchester (1 x ENU mutant, 2 x CRISPR). Given the nature of the human condition and the samhd1 morphant phenotype, severe developmental phenotypes were expected in homozygous mutants for each of these three lines. However, all homozygotes are viable and survive to adulthood. Further phenotypic exploration has focussed primarily on one of these mutant lines - the CRISPR/Cas9-induced 23bp deletion (?23bp) line - details of which are described below.

Embryos injected (F0) with guide-RNA (gRNA) specific for exon 4 of the zebrafish samhd1 gene and Cas9 RNA were assessed for indels using restriction diagnostics and raised to adulthood before outcrossing onto a WT background (F1). Sanger sequencing of F1 DNA identified the presence of two heterozygous mutant alleles - a 2bp deletion and a 23bp deletion. Both alleles are predicted to cause truncation of the translated protein. Heterozygous F1 fish were grown to adulthood and subsequently in-crossed to test for homozygosity. Phenotypic assessments have focussed on the ?23bp line (Fig. 1). Gross developmental abnormalities were assessed in mixed genotype clutches; however, no genotype:phenotype correlations were observed. Due to the retention of maternal RNA/proteins in larval yolk, early developmental phenotypes are often inhibited in zebrafish until the yolk gradually recedes over the first few days of life. To test for this, we performed survival analyses between 5 and 14 days post-fertilisation. However, once again, no significant trend for homozygous lethality was observed. Indeed, homozygous mutants (F1 and F2) are viable, breed, and survive to over 12 months of age. Whole brains from three age-matched (~13 months) WT, heterozygous and homozygous siblings have been harvested, fixed and sectioned. Histological analysis will be performed beyond the end of the grant, to assess for neurovascular/inflammatory pathology. 

Since SAMHD1-related AGS is associated with an increased risk of ICH, and a significant proportion of samhd1 morphant zebrafish larvae exhibit brain haemorrhage [7], we tested for brain bleeding phenotypes in the WT and homozygous samhd1 ?23bp siblings using the haemoglobin stain o-dianisidine during larval stages. In untreated larvae, no significant difference in the proportion of animals exhibiting brain haemorrhages was observed between WT and homozygous mutants (Fig.2). However, following treatment with atorvastatin, a chemical known to induce neurovascular rupture and brain-specific bleeding in zebrafish embryos [8], an increase in the proportion of larvae displaying brain haemorrhages was observed in homozygous mutants in comparison to WT. Within the 0.5-1&micro;M dose range, these differences were statistically significant (Fig.2), suggesting that homozygosity for the samhd1 23bp deletion is associated with a degree of neurovascular instability. Future work will continue to investigate this observation. For example, we have now crossed the samhd1 ?23bp allele onto a kdrl:mCherry transgenic reporter background [9] to allow for observation of blood vessel formation in the brain. 

Increased expression of type I IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) is a biochemical hallmark of all AGS subtypes [10]. We previously showed that temporal gene knockdown of samhd1 is associated with significant upregulation of zebrafish ISG expression [7]. To determine whether germline mutation of samhd1 in zebrafish also induces a type I IFN signature, we performed quantitative PCR on WT and homozygous mutant siblings. Fish were harvested and RNA was extracted at 5, 14 and 28 days post-fertilisation (dpf), and qPCR performed using a previously established panel of Taqman probes [7]. At each time point, an increased expression of some of these genes was observed in homozygotes. However, inconsistencies between genes and ages exist (Fig.3). To further investigate this matter, we treated larvae with Poly (I:C) - a synthetic double-stranded RNA molecule which is commonly used to evoke type I IFN signalling [11]. RNA from untreated and treated larvae was harvested at 5dpf. As before, untreated homozygotes exhibited increased expression of some of the genes within our panel in comparison to WT, and a trend for augmented expression was observed in homozygotes treated with Poly (I:C) (Fig.4). However, the biological relevance of these data remains unclear, and further investigation of this point is ongoing using other stimulation techniques. Morpholino knockdown of samhd1 was also associated with increased expression of the zebrafish type I IFN, ifnphi1 [7]. Thus, the samhd1 ?23bp allele has been crossed onto the ifnphi1:mCherry transgenic reporter background in preparation for future experiments.

To determine the effects of the 23bp deletion on protein translation, we performed western blotting on WT and homozygote siblings using established protocols [7]. However, we experienced significant issues with antibody specificity and/or recognition of the samhd1 protein. Numerous antibody batches have been tested from a range of suppliers. However, we have still not obtained a satisfactory result to date. 

Due to the severity of SAMHD1-related AGS and the samhd1 morphant zebrafish phenotype, we expected to observe a strong phenotype in our stable mutant samhd1 zebrafish line. One potential explanation for the absence of such might be the phenomenon of 'genetic compensation' that can occur in stable mutant zebrafish [12]. Of note, the samhd1-like gene is a recently annotated zebrafish transcript that is annotated as a paralogue of samhd1. Structurally, the translated samhd1-like protein shares significant homology with the C-terminal of samhd1. Mutant constructs, resembling the structure of this paralogue, retain HIV restriction activity when overexpressed in cells [13], indicating that the function of this protein is comparable to samhd1 itself. Therefore, it is feasible that expression of samhd1-like could compensate for loss of samhd1 in homozygous mutants. Precedent for this possibility exists in the literature, in a tdp43/tdp43-like double mutant model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [14]. Although genomic sequences are highly homologous, differences exist, and 5 mismatches in the target sequence used for the samhd1 gRNA and the same region in samhd1-like are present. Sequence analysis using samhd1-like-specific primers indicates that the WT transcript exists in homozygous mutant animals. Given these data, new samhd1-like-specific gRNA have been generated and we are now raising a samhd1/samhd1-like double mutant line which will then be assessed for neurovascular and inflammatory defects.

Work in the last year

In an attempt to identify novel molecular dysregulation consequent upon the samhd1 ?23bp allele, we performed RNA-Seq on WT and homozygous mutant animals. RNA was extracted from pooled groups (n=20) of whole larvae at 5dpf. WT and homozygous mutant pooled groups were harvested as four biological replicates. Differential gene expression analyses were performed by the Bioinformatics Core Facility at the University of Manchester. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used for further assessment of transcript expression. Most strikingly, IPA revealed that the expression of nine genes (sqle, nsdhl, ebp, dhcr24, hsd17b7, msmo1, lss, sc5d and cyp51a1) belonging to the 'Cholesterol Biosynthesis' pathway was significantly reduced in the homozygous mutant group compared to WT (Fig. 5). qPCR verification of these data revealed a reduction in the expression of all six genes tested in homozygous samhd1 ?23bp larvae in comparison to WT larvae at 5dpf (Fig. 6A). A comparable, albeit smaller, reduction in expression of these genes was also observed in RNA derived from adult brain tissue obtained from WT, heterozygous and homozygous samhd1 ?23bp fish at ~ 1.5 years of age (Fig. 6B). We are currently performing experiments to measure cholesterol levels per se in this model. However, at the transcriptional level, these data indicate that the samhd1 ?23bp allele is associated with a reduction in cholesterol. 

Statins are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors commonly prescribed for the lowering of cholesterol levels and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Interestingly, treatment of zebrafish embryos with atorvastatin induces ICH. This is predicted to be due to a reduction in cholesterol and essential lipids necessary for stabilisation of endothelial cell-cell contacts within the neurovasculature, leading to weakness of blood vessel walls and rupture [15]. Although the developing zebrafish brain is likely to represent an 'extreme' model of such a mechanism, recent epidemiological studies have also identified low cholesterol as a risk factor for ICH in humans [16, 17], suggesting that this phenomenon has clinical and translational relevance. Although transcriptomic analyses reveal that homozygous samhd1 ?23bp larvae demonstrate reduced cholesterol levels, these fish do not exhibit any physical phenotype in the absence of treatment. However, upon stimulation with 'sub-threshold' doses of atorvastatin, they are vulnerable to ICH (Fig.2). These data indicate that the putative genetically-induced deficiency in cholesterol synthesis alone is not sufficient to drive an ICH phenotype. However, treatment with low dose atorvastatin in some way 'breaches' a threshold of neurovascular in / stability, manifest by ICH. 

Although a modest increase in the expression of type I IFN induced gene transcripts has been observed in immune cells obtained from Samhd1 knockout (KO) mice, these animals do not display any physical phenotype [6]. We hypothesised that a lack of phenotype might be explained by a 'cholesterol deficiency' threshold, where an environmental challenge is required to sufficiently reduce cholesterol levels for induction of a neurovascular phenotype akin to that seen in our zebrafish model. To test this possibility, we harvested RNA from brain and liver of WT and Samhd1 KO sex-matched mice at ~3 weeks of age (in collaboration with Prof. Jan Rehwinkel, University of Oxford). Taqman qPCR was performed using probes targeting the mouse orthologues described in Fig.6. No differences between genotypes were observed in gene expression in either brain or liver (Fig. 7). These data suggest that loss of mouse Samhd1 is not associated with a cholesterol biosynthesis deficiency at the transcriptional level. 

The role of SAMHD1 in viral restriction and innate immunity is extremely well documented [18]. However, these functions do not easily explain why, specifically, AGS5 patients are susceptible to ICH. Indeed, we have hypothesised that SAMHD1 has an unrecognised function in the maintenance of neurovascular integrity. Given the link between low cholesterol and the risk of human ICH [16, 17], our zebrafish data indicate a novel function of SAMHD1 in cholesterol biosynthesis worthy of further study. In this regard, we note that it has been shown that limiting cholesterol synthesis in macrophages can engage a type I IFN response [19]. We are continuing to investigate the possible link between SAMHD1, AGS5 and cholesterol biosynthesis, and have recently been awarded an MRC PhD studentship to continue this work - with Dr Kasher as the PI.

Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user.

This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

Greater scientific productivity: As well as speed increases, the optimisation of codes for the ARCHER machine will enable problems to be solved in less time using fewer compute resources.
• For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
• Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
• Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
• Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
• Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
• Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &quot;above average&quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
• What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
• What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2017","HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:
Computational Molecular Science 2017 - on Sunday 19 March 2017 
17th European Seminar on Computational Methods in Quantum Chemistry - on Tuesday 11 July 2017
Frontiers of Biomolecular Simulation Southampton, September 2016
Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

• For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
• Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
• Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
• Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
• Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
• Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

Other Highlights for the Current Reporting Period: Please provide details of any other significant highlights from the reporting period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.


Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &quot;above average&quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
• What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
• What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.","http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk","58c718729fa8f1.76571364","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c718729fa8f1.76571364&grantRef=EP%2FM022609%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M022609/1","03A51050-21FD-4237-BC8E-F7A5280EB692","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","2A2990B1-E1E1-4888-8848-7C256C3A3B43"

Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:

17th European Seminar on Computational Methods in Quantum Chemistry - on Tuesday 11 July 2017
Frontiers of Biomolecular Simulation Southampton, September 2016
Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

Greater scientific productivity: As well as speed increases, the optimisation of codes for the ARCHER machine will enable problems to be solved in less time using fewer compute resources.
• For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
• Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
• Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
• Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
• Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
• Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

Other Highlights for the Current Reporting Period: Please provide details of any other significant highlights from the reporting period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.


Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &quot;above average&quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
• What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
• What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2017","HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:
Computational Molecular Science 2017 - on Sunday 19 March 2017 
17th European Seminar on Computational Methods in Quantum Chemistry - on Tuesday 11 July 2017
Frontiers of Biomolecular Simulation Southampton, September 2016
Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

Greater scientific productivity: As well as speed increases, the optimisation of codes for the ARCHER machine will enable problems to be solved in less time using fewer compute resources.
• For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
• Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
• Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
• Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
• Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
• Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

Other Highlights for the Current Reporting Period: Please provide details of any other significant highlights from the reporting period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.


Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &quot;above average&quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
• What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
• What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.","http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk","58c718729fa8f1.76571364","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c718729fa8f1.76571364&grantRef=BB%2FL018756%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/L018756/1","6A6C5F1D-13B0-4993-B172-8357B193871C","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","2A2990B1-E1E1-4888-8848-7C256C3A3B43"

Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:
Computational Molecular Science 2017 - on Sunday 19 March 2017 
17th European Seminar on Computational Methods in Quantum Chemistry - on Tuesday 11 July 2017
Frontiers of Biomolecular Simulation Southampton, September 2016
Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

• For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
• Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
• Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
• Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
• Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
• Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

International activities (e.g. workshops) that have benefited from HECBioSim
The work performed with Sam resulted in an successful eCSE application for development work on the LAMMPS software. This is an international simulation package run out of Sandia labs in the US. Through this eCSE application we were able to update the rotational integrator and improve the load balancing for our hybrid simulation methodology. These developments have been incorporated in the latest release versions of the code. An ARCHER training webinar resulted from this work.

Other Highlights for the Current Reporting Period: Please provide details of any other significant highlights from the reporting period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.


Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &quot;above average&quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
• What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
• What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2017","HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:
Computational Molecular Science 2017 - on Sunday 19 March 2017 
17th European Seminar on Computational Methods in Quantum Chemistry - on Tuesday 11 July 2017
Frontiers of Biomolecular Simulation Southampton, September 2016
Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

• For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
• Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
• Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
• Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
• Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
• Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

Other Highlights for the Current Reporting Period: Please provide details of any other significant highlights from the reporting period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.


Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &quot;above average&quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
• What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
• What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.","http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk","58c718729fa8f1.76571364","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c718729fa8f1.76571364&grantRef=EP%2FM027546%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M027546/1","BAF8525B-FAC9-471E-8D86-927040744974","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","2A2990B1-E1E1-4888-8848-7C256C3A3B43"
"EPSRC","EP/L000253/1","Research Grant","Research Tools and Methods","University of Bristol","Chemistry","Mulholland","Adrian","","Annual report to EPSRC; details below","HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:
Computational Molecular Science 2017 - on Sunday 19 March 2017 
17th European Seminar on Computational Methods in Quantum Chemistry - on Tuesday 11 July 2017
Frontiers of Biomolecular Simulation Southampton, September 2016
Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

Greater scientific productivity: As well as speed increases, the optimisation of codes for the ARCHER machine will enable problems to be solved in less time using fewer compute resources.
• For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
• Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
• Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
• Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
• Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
• Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

Other Highlights for the Current Reporting Period: Please provide details of any other significant highlights from the reporting period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.


Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &quot;above average&quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
• What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
• What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.","Improvements to research infrastructure","","","Yes","2017","HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:
Computational Molecular Science 2017 - on Sunday 19 March 2017 
17th European Seminar on Computational Methods in Quantum Chemistry - on Tuesday 11 July 2017
Frontiers of Biomolecular Simulation Southampton, September 2016
Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.
Membership

Greater scientific productivity: As well as speed increases, the optimisation of codes for the ARCHER machine will enable problems to be solved in less time using fewer compute resources.
• For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
• Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
• Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
• Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
• Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
• Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &quot;above average&quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
• What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
• What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.","http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk","58c718729fa8f1.76571364","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=58c718729fa8f1.76571364&grantRef=EP%2FL000253%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/L000253/1","82FC72D1-24C9-4EF1-A97E-6CC10BFAF775","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","4A348A76-B2D0-4DDD-804A-CE735A6D3798","2A2990B1-E1E1-4888-8848-7C256C3A3B43"
