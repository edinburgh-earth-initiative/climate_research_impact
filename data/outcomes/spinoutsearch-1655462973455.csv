"EPSRC","1836514","Studentship","Spin Outs","Brunel University","Mech. Engineering, Aerospace & Civil Eng",,,"","WASE LIMITED","WASE provides decentralised wastewater treatment and biogas production plant, that are designed to treat wastewater for communities and industry. The system is modular allowing it to easily be scaled and adapt to the growing demand of wastewater treatment as communities and business grow. Our solution reduces the size and cost of wastewater treatment making it accessible to communities that are faced with poor sanitation and energy access, which stifles economic growth. 
We use a circular economy model to recover the valuable elements within wastewater that can be used locally. Most of our competitors focus on the removal of contaminants, with the recovery of one or two elements. We recover all the valuable elements; energy, nutrients and water. Additionally, our modular technology is designed to suit differing needs depending on the site and the customer. Our circular approach is the most sustainable option for decentralised sanitation that minimizes waste and reduces our customer's costs. The modularity means we can increase the capacity of the system from 10 users to 20,000+. The energy we produce is high quality, and the customer can choose how they utilise it, whether they convert the methane into electricity or use it for cooking, heating or cooling. 
The water crisis is the largest global threat due to the potential impact it has on society, along with energy price shocks and biodiversity loss. 2.3 billion people do not have adequate sanitation, 1.4 billion people lack access to electricity and 2.7 billion people do not have access to clean cooking facilities. The water-energy-food nexus highlights the links between these challenges and the need for solutions that address all three areas. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) is often seen as a social issue; however, the world bank estimates that $169 billion is lost globally every year due to poor sanitation. Across 18 countries in Africa the World Bank estimates 20 million latrines are required to eliminate open defecation with the current population. Most countries are investing as little as 0.1% of GDP into sanitation services even though economic losses are around 1-2.5%. There are multiple issues surrounding sanitation service, creating bottle necks that are limiting investment into new services. One of the main issues is the cost of installing traditional pit latrines or centralised treatment that requires costly treatment and vast amounts of water. These issues are also present in refugee camps and across other continents such as Asia; India is losing an estimated $53.8 billion from poor sanitation. Think tanks and humanitarian agencies such as Chatham House and The Toilet Board Coalition are asking for private companies to enter the market and develop sustainable and affordable decentralised sanitation systems that treat wastewater adequately (REF). Decentralised treatment is not only an issue in developing communities but also in some areas of the EU, where countries like Scotland have rural communities with no centralised wastewater infrastructure (REF).
WASE carried out an initial assessment of sanitation and energy systems in developing communities, assessing the most suitable technologies in 2016. The study revealed an opportunity to recover resources from the waste in a sustainable way according to circular economy principles using Electro-Methanogenic Reactors (EMR). EMRs are an emerging technology that have shown promise for future wastewater treatment. The research has progressed to find multiple technologies within this field, with EMRs being the most commercially viable. The systems have typically been designed for industrialised communities using expensive catalysts and membranes, however, WASE is developing low cost electrode materials and removed the membranes, making the technology economically viable for developing and remote regions.","2017","WASE has won 4 awards including UK Energy Innovation Award, Shell Livewire, NACUE Entrepreneurship competition, Santander Universities Entrepreneur (Tech Catagory), and was a finalist in the MIAT prize, What Design Can Do, and Climate Launchpad. WASE is on the leading EU accelerator program Climate KIC, and is also part of the Exeter Velocities Nurture program. WASE has won grants from the UNWFP sprint program and Innovate UK 3 full-time jobs have been created, and 3 tempory positions with another 4 positions starting in June. WASE has built a pilot decentralised system in Ital with the UN and is now deploying the system in Kenya to treat the waste for 100 people in Daadad.","http://www.wase-tech.com","5c893c0e41fed0.20683176","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=5c893c0e41fed0.20683176&grantRef=1836514","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=1836514","9F315846-0A88-46D8-A46D-2D3AAD49D04C","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","BECA2763-0902-40AA-8DB2-836A5731CF58",

This nutritious protein source acts as a more sustainable alternative to soy or fishmeal, the conventional protein sources for livestock and aquaculture feed. The Deep Branch Biotechnology co-founders met whilst at the University of Nottingham's Synthetic Biology Research Centre (SBRC). Whilst working together on ways to utilize gas fermentation for production of chemicals, the team discovered they had a shared desire to make a positive impact of the world. Pete and Bart left the SBRC to pursue new challenges in commercial and academic biotech, whilst Rob remained at to continue the work of his PhD.

They were able to go from idea to raising pre-seed funding within four months, and haven't looked back since.

DEEP BRANCH biological carbon recycling solution helps companies who want to reduce their carbon footprint without impacting negatively on operational costs. Unlike traditional carbon storage technology that simply collects carbon dioxide, we use it for something meaningful. Our biological process converts the carbon dioxide into sustainable protein, and unlike conventional biological methods, such as algae cultivation, it requires minimal labour and land, and no sunlight.","2018","n June 2019, Deep Branch Biotechnology and Drax Power Group announced their partnership as part of the BECCUS (BioEnergy Carbon Capture Utilisation & Storage) project. Drax are the UK's largest renewable energy producer and the partnership will see Deep Branch utilising carbon dioxide from Drax's flue gas at their renewable energy plant in Yorkshire (UK). Following full lab-scale validation of the Deep Branch Biotechnology process, this partnership represents the first real-world application of the technology. The partnership with Drax offers an opportunity to validate using carbon dioxide that is already generated in a sustainable fashion. Because Drax's biomass units are carbon neutral at the point of generation, the process creates extremely low-carbon protein. This pilot project represents a major step towards roll-out of a with the potential to generate large quantities of sustainable protein. By using this protein as animal feed, production of animal products becomes less environmentally impactful, whilst arable land conventionally used for soy production will be made available for other uses.","https://deepbranchbio.com/","5e53e212141d46.91317864","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=5e53e212141d46.91317864&grantRef=BB%2FL013940%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/L013940/1","320A74B3-120A-4DE7-BCE3-85D0959CD989","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","936D002F-A8D1-4A93-AE5D-825ED0903D8D","CAB13A88-E7C2-42DB-973E-3D6A5E305AF7"

Build Solar are a recent spin-out from the University of Exeter (June 2017), following five years of solar concentrator research led by Dr. Hasan Baig and Prof. Tapas Mallick. The company seeks to develop and commercialize innovative construction materials by embedding advanced photovoltaic technology into them. These construction materials also classed as Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) replace an element of the building skin/ facade and easily integrate within the built environment. 

Build Solar's first patent pending product &quot;Solar Squared&quot; transforms the widely used Glass Blocks into a multifunctional product that provides electricity, daylighting and improved thermal insulation. Typical Glass Blocks are used on the exterior walls of a building to provide daylighting and privacy to the indoor environment. However, the void inside these glass blocks leads to thermal losses and hence higher U-Values. Solar Squared incorporates a plurality of glass projections inside this hollow space serving to disrupt convection currents forming in the void and cutting down thermal losses leading to lower U-values. Further, the shape of these projections allows for concentration of incoming solar radiation. Connecting small sized solar cells along these projections simultaneously generates more electricity per unit solar cell area and provides privacy to the indoor environments. The front face of these projections can also be varied to incorporate better aesthetics within the product. 

Aimed at the commercial and public construction sectors our current product Solar Squared provides all the standard benefits of using glass blocks for building exteriors such as daylighting, protection, and structure but also generates electricity in the form of solar energy and offers enhanced thermal insulation. Predicted that the BIPV Market will grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to over $9 billion in 2019, and surge to $26 billion by 2022. We want to be a part of this exciting market opportunity and aim to capture at least 5 % of this market in the coming five years through our innovative solutions.

Having solar energy collection integrated into the building envelope as part of the design replaces conventional building envelope materials with a smart and multifunctional technology that not only serves it original purpose but also has a financial payback through electricity generation and energy savings. The incorporation of the PV technology within the building structure prevents PV system theft which is increasingly problematic in both developed and developing countries. Onsite energy generation (OSG) will reduce energy losses associated with transmitting power from a far and reduce dependency on grid infrastructure. Coupled with the increasing availability of building scale battery storage technology, our technology has the potential to be an important part of the emerging distributed OSG clean energy system.

As an organization we have applied a lean manufacturing strategy for the development of our product. We have tied up with existing glass block manufacturer to produce our innovative glass block henceforth avoiding any further emissions and environmental impacts by deploying a completely new production setup. We have also tied up with existing solar cell manufacturers to produce our unique solar cell technology. This way we have avoided almost 70% of carbon emissions that would happen if we were to completely manufacture our entire product. While the product has been in technological development for last one year, the commercial business is relatively young and still essentially a start-up so has no financials.

Build Solar aims to develop several construction materials that integrate solar technology, partly mitigating the negative environmental effects of rising building energy consumption. Further, the company aims to develop a network of international partnerships construction companies that sell, distribute, and install construction materials. 

Personnel: 

Dr. Hasan Baig (Founder &amp; CEO-Build Solar) leads new product and new market activities. He obtained his PhD (2015) in Renewable Energy from the University of Exeter, UK. For his research Hasan won the Impact Award in the Sustainable Futures category at the university of Exeter in 2013.

He presented the company profile at the Cleantech Innovate UK and the BRE BIPV stakeholders workshop this year. Hasan is managing the overall operations and networking with many stakeholders towards building the company's future directions.
 
Prof. Tapas Mallick, Scientific Advisor and Chairman for the company is a World leader in BIPV technology. He is currently the Chair in Clean Technologies, Environment &amp; Sustainability Institute, University of Exeter, UK. He has brought in grant funding of more than 350,000 GBP in the research for Building Integrated solar technologies at the University of Exeter. Tapas is communicating the company profile through his own scientific networks and seeking opportunities to collaborate on a scientific scale through any potential grant funding opportunities.

Jim Williams is a Non-Executive Director and commercialization manager at Build Solar. He has a background in product development, manufacturing, and retail of consumer outdoor goods. He is continuously in touch with the glass block industry partners and investors to bring in more interest towards the company. 

The company has developed strong links with national level business such as HS2 and Network Rail towards large scale deployment of the technology. The company has also successfully completed Innovate UK SBRI funding towards feasibility of the technology. 

The company is in discussion with external bodies for business plan development.","2017","60% of global carbon emissions are caused by buildings. Our vision is to challenge this adversity through the concept of Net Zero Energy buildings, meaning the total amount of energy used on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site. BUILD SOLAR aims to commercialize innovative photovoltaic solutions by combining them with traditional construction materials and transforming buildings from energy consumers to power generators. Through a series of its products, the company is poised to become a major key player in the building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) industry. The BIPV market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 16% between 2016 and 2024 and the global market is currently valued at $7 billion. To catch up with this growing industry and gather further momentum BUILD SOLAR is currently faced with several obstacles including lack of education about these technologies among architects, standard product specifications, building regulatory, manufacturing costs and lack of well-trained installers. Aimed at the commercial and public sectors, our first product Solar Squared provides standard benefits such as daylighting, protection, and structure alongside electricity generation and better thermal insulation. The company has established a route to market within the UK market through Glass Block Technology Limited, one of the major glass block sellers, distributors, and installers in Europe. The company will build a network of partnerships with similar glass block companies to access international markets in the future. We have already patented our technology through the following UK patent Construction Block with Photovoltaic Device, PATENT APPLICATION NUMBER 1705840.5. Our technical impact has been very strong on the glass block industry wherein we have completely transformed a standard construction material into an innovative energy solution. Prototyping of our first product Solar Squared is in progress and we hope to complete it by August this year. Further new designs of the product are being developed for the next round of prototyping. Socially we have presented our product to the public, researchers and school children visiting the Environment & Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter. We have also participated in the stakeholder workshop on BIPV technologies organized by BRE. Through this workshop we have introduced our product to existing BIPV manufacturers and gathered their feedback, understand the wider challenges BIPV industry faces and unlock routes for future developments. The Solar Squared unit will improve the performance of a widely used building material (glass block). The function of architectural glass blocks is to allow daylighting, and lower artificial lighting loads. Thus, Build Solar have reduced the active cell area of the PV, while still pulling back efficiency and yield by concentrating incoming light. The power density at standard tests conditions is analogous to approx. 25 Wp/m2. This compares well with amorphous silicon and organic photovoltaics which also have a similar power density. With the addition of the concentrators and solar cells in the block, internal convective air currents are reduced which in turn improves the thermal insulation performance of the block versus the standard hollow version. The traditional glass block has a U-Value =2.8 W/m2 K. Solar Squared Glass Block aims to reduce this by up to 50 %. The improvement of U-Value to 1.4 W/m2 K will result in thermal energy savings of 0.51 kWh/annum/block. This equates to Year 1 savings of 69,700 kWh, the equivalent of 6 houses' energy demand. By year 4 this is 4,056,114 kWh or 347 houses (based on U-Value improvement from 2.8 to 1.4 W/m2 K, Year 1-unit sales of 136,400 units, year 5 unit sales of 7,937,600 units and an average UK household energy usage of 11,700 kWH p.a.). The CO2e savings equate to 24t CO2e saved in Year 1 rising to 1,425t CO2e by Year 4 (based on UK grid CO2e grid electricity of 0.35156kg CO2e/kWH, BEIS Carbon Factors 2017). The price per tonne of carbon saved equates to ?73k in Year 1 falling to just ?11k per tonne by Year 4. Assuming full market adoption to 114m glass blocks this results in carbon savings of over 20,000t per annum. The concentration concept is not new and has been proven in other concentrating solar technologies. In the case of Solar Squared, the team at Exeter have chosen a relatively low power concentrator which magnifies by a factor 3 - 6. This allows the concentrating lens to have a wide angle of acceptance (ca. half acceptance angle 35&deg;), meaning that contrary to typical high concentration application which need dual axis tracking, a vertically installed south facing Solar Squared array should be able to receive light for at least 7 hours a day. The Energy Payback Time of the system can be as low as 3yrs which is comparable to current rooftop PV technologies, something that current BIPV struggle to deliver. The Energy Return On Investment of Solar Squared is targeted to be less than 5 years with an estimated equivalent carbon footprint of 20g CO2e/kWh energy generated. Based on the BEIS toolkit for valuation of energy use the Year 4 energy savings have an NPV of?619,280 and an annualized NPV. BUILD SOLAR is a recent startup and an outcome of more than five years of Solar PV research at the University of Exeter. Since its launch at the Cleantech Innovate UK in April this year it has managed to raise a lot of interest from several construction companies and media.

Build Solar are a recent spin-out from the University of Exeter (June 2017), following five years of solar concentrator research led by Dr. Hasan Baig and Prof. Tapas Mallick. The company seeks to develop and commercialize innovative construction materials by embedding advanced photovoltaic technology into them. These construction materials also classed as Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) replace an element of the building skin/ facade and easily integrate within the built environment. 

Build Solar's first patent pending product &quot;Solar Squared&quot; transforms the widely used Glass Blocks into a multifunctional product that provides electricity, daylighting and improved thermal insulation. Typical Glass Blocks are used on the exterior walls of a building to provide daylighting and privacy to the indoor environment. However, the void inside these glass blocks leads to thermal losses and hence higher U-Values. Solar Squared incorporates a plurality of glass projections inside this hollow space serving to disrupt convection currents forming in the void and cutting down thermal losses leading to lower U-values. Further, the shape of these projections allows for concentration of incoming solar radiation. Connecting small sized solar cells along these projections simultaneously generates more electricity per unit solar cell area and provides privacy to the indoor environments. The front face of these projections can also be varied to incorporate better aesthetics within the product. 

Aimed at the commercial and public construction sectors our current product Solar Squared provides all the standard benefits of using glass blocks for building exteriors such as daylighting, protection, and structure but also generates electricity in the form of solar energy and offers enhanced thermal insulation. Predicted that the BIPV Market will grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to over $9 billion in 2019, and surge to $26 billion by 2022. We want to be a part of this exciting market opportunity and aim to capture at least 5 % of this market in the coming five years through our innovative solutions.

Having solar energy collection integrated into the building envelope as part of the design replaces conventional building envelope materials with a smart and multifunctional technology that not only serves it original purpose but also has a financial payback through electricity generation and energy savings. The incorporation of the PV technology within the building structure prevents PV system theft which is increasingly problematic in both developed and developing countries. Onsite energy generation (OSG) will reduce energy losses associated with transmitting power from a far and reduce dependency on grid infrastructure. Coupled with the increasing availability of building scale battery storage technology, our technology has the potential to be an important part of the emerging distributed OSG clean energy system.

As an organization we have applied a lean manufacturing strategy for the development of our product. We have tied up with existing glass block manufacturer to produce our innovative glass block henceforth avoiding any further emissions and environmental impacts by deploying a completely new production setup. We have also tied up with existing solar cell manufacturers to produce our unique solar cell technology. This way we have avoided almost 70% of carbon emissions that would happen if we were to completely manufacture our entire product. While the product has been in technological development for last one year, the commercial business is relatively young and still essentially a start-up so has no financials.

Build Solar aims to develop several construction materials that integrate solar technology, partly mitigating the negative environmental effects of rising building energy consumption. Further, the company aims to develop a network of international partnerships construction companies that sell, distribute, and install construction materials.

Predicted that the BIPV Market will grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to over $9 billion in 2019, and surge to $26 billion by 2022. We want to be a part of this exciting market opportunity and aim to capture at least 5 % of this market in the coming five years through our innovative solutions.

Having solar energy collection integrated into the building envelope as part of the design replaces conventional building envelope materials with a smart and multifunctional technology that not only serves it original purpose but also has a financial payback through electricity generation and energy savings. The incorporation of the PV technology within the building structure prevents PV system theft which is increasingly problematic in both developed and developing countries. Onsite energy generation (OSG) will reduce energy losses associated with transmitting power from a far and reduce dependency on grid infrastructure. Coupled with the increasing availability of building scale battery storage technology, our technology has the potential to be an important part of the emerging distributed OSG clean energy system.

As an organization we have applied a lean manufacturing strategy for the development of our product. We have tied up with existing glass block manufacturer to produce our innovative glass block henceforth avoiding any further emissions and environmental impacts by deploying a completely new production setup. We have also tied up with existing solar cell manufacturers to produce our unique solar cell technology. This way we have avoided almost 70% of carbon emissions that would happen if we were to completely manufacture our entire product. While the product has been in technological development for last one year, the commercial business is relatively young and still essentially a start-up so has no financials.

Build Solar aims to develop several construction materials that integrate solar technology, partly mitigating the negative environmental effects of rising building energy consumption. Further, the company aims to develop a network of international partnerships construction companies that sell, distribute, and install construction materials.

Our vision is to challenge this adversity through the concept of Net Zero Energy buildings, meaning the total amount of energy used on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site. BUILD SOLAR aims to commercialize innovative photovoltaic solutions by combining them with traditional construction materials and transforming buildings from energy consumers to power generators. Through a series of its products, the company is poised to become a major key player in the building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) industry. The BIPV market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 16% between 2016 and 2024 and the global market is currently valued at $7 billion. To catch up with this growing industry and gather further momentum BUILD SOLAR is currently faced with several obstacles including lack of education about these technologies among architects, standard product specifications, building regulatory, manufacturing costs and lack of well-trained installers. Aimed at the commercial and public sectors, our first product Solar Squared provides standard benefits such as daylighting, protection, and structure alongside electricity generation and better thermal insulation. The company has established a route to market within the UK market through Glass Block Technology Limited, one of the major glass block sellers, distributors, and installers in Europe. The company will build a network of partnerships with similar glass block companies to access international markets in the future. We have already patented our technology through the following UK patent Construction Block with Photovoltaic Device, PATENT APPLICATION NUMBER 1705840.5. Our technical impact has been very strong on the glass block industry wherein we have completely transformed a standard construction material into an innovative energy solution. Prototyping of our first product Solar Squared is in progress and we hope to complete it by August this year. Further new designs of the product are being developed for the next round of prototyping. Socially we have presented our product to the public, researchers and school children visiting the Environment & Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter. We have also participated in the stakeholder workshop on BIPV technologies organized by BRE. Through this workshop we have introduced our product to existing BIPV manufacturers and gathered their feedback, understand the wider challenges BIPV industry faces and unlock routes for future developments. The Solar Squared unit will improve the performance of a widely used building material (glass block). The function of architectural glass blocks is to allow daylighting, and lower artificial lighting loads. Thus, Build Solar have reduced the active cell area of the PV, while still pulling back efficiency and yield by concentrating incoming light. The power density at standard tests conditions is analogous to approx. 25 Wp/m2. This compares well with amorphous silicon and organic photovoltaics which also have a similar power density. With the addition of the concentrators and solar cells in the block, internal convective air currents are reduced which in turn improves the thermal insulation performance of the block versus the standard hollow version. The traditional glass block has a U-Value =2.8 W/m2 K. Solar Squared Glass Block aims to reduce this by up to 50 %. The improvement of U-Value to 1.4 W/m2 K will result in thermal energy savings of 0.51 kWh/annum/block. This equates to Year 1 savings of 69,700 kWh, the equivalent of 6 houses' energy demand. By year 4 this is 4,056,114 kWh or 347 houses (based on U-Value improvement from 2.8 to 1.4 W/m2 K, Year 1-unit sales of 136,400 units, year 5 unit sales of 7,937,600 units and an average UK household energy usage of 11,700 kWH p.a.). The CO2e savings equate to 24t CO2e saved in Year 1 rising to 1,425t CO2e by Year 4 (based on UK grid CO2e grid electricity of 0.35156kg CO2e/kWH, BEIS Carbon Factors 2017). The price per tonne of carbon saved equates to ?73k in Year 1 falling to just ?11k per tonne by Year 4. Assuming full market adoption to 114m glass blocks this results in carbon savings of over 20,000t per annum. The concentration concept is not new and has been proven in other concentrating solar technologies. In the case of Solar Squared, the team at Exeter have chosen a relatively low power concentrator which magnifies by a factor 3 - 6. This allows the concentrating lens to have a wide angle of acceptance (ca. half acceptance angle 35&deg;), meaning that contrary to typical high concentration application which need dual axis tracking, a vertically installed south facing Solar Squared array should be able to receive light for at least 7 hours a day. The Energy Payback Time of the system can be as low as 3yrs which is comparable to current rooftop PV technologies, something that current BIPV struggle to deliver. The Energy Return On Investment of Solar Squared is targeted to be less than 5 years with an estimated equivalent carbon footprint of 20g CO2e/kWh energy generated. Based on the BEIS toolkit for valuation of energy use the Year 4 energy savings have an NPV of?619,280 and an annualized NPV. BUILD SOLAR is a recent startup and an outcome of more than five years of Solar PV research at the University of Exeter. Since its launch at the Cleantech Innovate UK in April this year it has managed to raise a lot of interest from several construction companies and media.

The primary vision of the company is to provide sustainable solutions for the manufacturing of xylitol through innovations in Industrial Biotechnology (IB). Xylitol, a natural sweetener, with wide ranging applications as a sugar substitute has an existing market of USD 730M forecasted to cross USD 1B by 2020 (CAGR of 6.2%). Regulatory and raw material supply issues with current commercial production, via a chemical catalysis process, has resulted in a global supply shortage and resultant price spike (by almost 50%). ABL aims to use this opportunity using its disruptive EcoXyl technology and offers a raw material agnostic, cost-effective, sustainable and regulatory-compliant production approach. Overall we strive to curtail the global sugar epidemic and promote sustainable living whilst ensuring job creation and growth.
EcoXyl's innovation include easing the strained supply chain by providing flexibility in raw material sourcing (uses waste from multiple sectors like farming, sugar, brewing, paper/pulp), lowering manufacturing costs by increasing sugar capture (75% vs current 40%) along with reducing number of process steps and promoting sustainable manufacturing by avoiding harsh conditions employed currently (toxic catalyst, high temperature/pressure). EcoXyl also overcomes typical drawbacks of other proposed biotech manufacturing routes (incomplete sugar conversion, microbial intolerance to waste liquor, inefficient downstream purification) yielding favorable process economics and strong potential to undercut current manufacturing. A process patent application for the technology is currently in PCT phase.
Whilst EcoXyl's has been implemented at TRL4 (g scale) to yield a minimum viable product, prospective technology adopters require demonstrable proof of EcoXyl's continued efficacy following further scale-up (TRL6; ton scale). Key project objectives thus include -
de-risking technology adoption through demonstration of process scalability from TRL4 to TRL5 (kg) and eventually TRL6 (tons; to be done after securing further funding), private sharing of prototype with collaborative end-users for beta-testing and early-stage regulatory assessments, engaging organisations with manufacturing expertise for potential Joint Venture/licensing agreements and/or identifying contract manufacturing opportunities for product delivery via partnering with xylitol distributors; and raising company profile via participation in business competitions and Investment forums, to enable further equity-driven funding via banks and VCs. ABL possesses 2 Letters of Intent from xylitol distributors. Initial discussions with Development Bank of Wales for securing further funds have been favorable. Other focus areas include rapid growth, building team with complimentary skills and ensuring company sustainability via sustained revenue generation.","2019","ARCITEKBIO Ltd launch date is 14th March 2019.",,"5c87b69de8d160.12090463","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=5c87b69de8d160.12090463&grantRef=BB%2FS011994%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/S011994/1","0A978208-E9AB-4A1B-A2C5-37276DE0602D","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","E4757A6E-7326-472B-9979-B47D77A65446","EFB7774C-2081-4D13-A3E1-82B0E4D343E9"

Being in a large room with so many designers and some of the language of design was quite new to me. I found it [the language] quite helpful and even parts that weren't design related, I found useful. The most challenging part for me was the 'Dragon's Den' type design process but it was very interesting.

Their work led to the design and build of two demonstration buildings (the Active Classroom, in 2017 and the Active Office in 2018) to test and prove a range of energy and digital technologies, as well as show how these technologies can be connected in one integrated system, working together to generate heat and power for the building, and where appropriate for associate vehicles and the local grid.
The success of the early Active Building demonstrators gave rise to the Active Building Centre, through funding by the UK government as part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund and UKRI. That support, including &pound;36m of funding, was provided to develop a national centre of excellence working with supply chains in the energy and construction sectors; in turn supported a parallel Active Building Research Programme involving ten universities: Swansea, Bath, Newcastle, Birmingham, Loughborough, UCL, Sheffield, Cardiff, Imperial College London and Nottingham. 
Objectives for the ABC include assisting WG in delivering a fairer, more equal and sustainable future; enabling Prosperity for All to deliver a low carbon Wales, through transformed energy and construction sectors in Wales, and across the UK.
The Active Building Centre works with national and local government, developers, energy distributors and homeowners, advising on how to most effectively deploy new technologies and innovative energy system solutions into new buildings or retrofit them into existing stock to optimise energy efficiency.","2019","The company has built six demonstrator buildings to date, three of which are based at their Berkeley research centre, and a further three projects: 1. The Trent Basin housing development in Nottingham - a pioneering community 'energy bubble'. Through Project SCENe it has become an exemplar in its approach to integrated renewables - community owned solar PV, battery storage and enabling infrastructure were installed at the construction stage, keeping the capital costs low. 2. ABC is supporting Carmarthenshire County Council and the Welsh Government in the delivery of a new low-carbon office and industrial development at Cross Hands, Carmarthenshire.The project is seeking to deliver highly energy-efficient, potentially net-zero-carbon buildings that are innovative in their use of renewable energy sources, adhere to 'Fabric First' principles to maximise material performance and qualify for a BREEAM 'Excellent' rating, signifying best practice in sustainability standards. 3. ABC is funding and partnering with Swansea University and the SPECIFIC Innovation and Knowledge Centre on the retrofit of Y Twyni, the two-storey modular lecture theatre facility on Swansea University's Bay Campus. The active upgrade involves the installation of rooftop photovoltaic solar panels, battery storage and rapid EV chargers. The company now employs 30+ full-time members of staff across a wide range of roles and continues to seek further funding to support the government and the construction industry adopt renewable technologies to achieve net-zero.","http://www.activebuildingcentre.com","61c1c81f559132.51697270","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=61c1c81f559132.51697270&grantRef=EP%2FN020863%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N020863/1","AED9B9B5-D2EE-4ED0-8C6D-BD0446579E37","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","AB307619-D4FA-427E-A042-09DBEBA84669","C5DFC3E9-D195-464E-89B8-DD07CEB1D045"

Electrolysis for hydrogen generation is increasingly being recognized as a key enabling technology for the supply of high purity hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles, energy systems and industrial applications.

Within these contexts, hydrogen production via electrolysis enables: 

 Maximising grid integration of renewables.
 Increasing the economic value of renewable assets (energy storage).
 Creation of a low zero carbon fuel to decarbonize transport, heat and industrial applications (CO2 reduction value).
 Economic application of ultrapure hydrogen in industrial and laboratory applications.

Current electrolytic hydrogen generation systems remain high cost, are not easily coupled to renewable sources and their cost reduction routes other than via economies of scale are limited.

The technology Astrea will exploit was developed by a team led by Professor Lee Cronin of the School of Chemistry at the University Of Glasgow. Scottish Enterprise, Scotland's economic development agency, have funded the project since 2013.

The technology has resulted in a patented system that has both cost and performance advantages over current current electrolyser and hydrogen storage systems including: increased durability, increased efficiency, low cost high pressure and high purity capability, reduced precious metal usage and low load capability for maximizing solar/wind capture and as a consequence delivers a lower cost of ownership to the end user.","2015","just started",,"56e04b69015622.91177243","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=56e04b69015622.91177243&grantRef=EP%2FJ00135X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/J00135X/1","D724974B-CE80-4112-9170-36A6D3EC1D25","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","AE58F21F-3622-4382-97BB-1359BD183E9F","1182919C-A9E8-42DE-87F5-0D5206F8294D"

The company has grown through their involvement with the NERC projects, collaboration with local Universities, and from winning high profile national awards and commendations from CIRIA's BIG Biodiversity Challenge in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The company has said, &quot;Arc has benefitted greatly from involvement in both the [NERC] IGGI Framework itself and the Public Engagement pilot work with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh. The primary result for us has been the creation of a new company, Artecology Ltd., through which we can develop the business potential of constructed habitats for the built environment. It is, I think, unlikely that Arc [Consulting] would have been able to build a partnership of industry and academic support sufficient to take this step without the NERC projects, but this has been much more than just access to good 'contacts'. The NERC collaborations have exposed us to critical thinking and analysis, robust testing and data collection, along with the individuals who have helped us to embed these methods into our work. Artecology is all about innovation in achieving ecological gains, finding new ways to deliver a biologically favourable urban realm; it's what we find most exciting and what we consider most urgent. The extensions of this work into climate change adaptation and indeed the evolution of 'small' wildlife in the urban world are compelling; and we will undoubtedly be better able to pursue these leads into yet more interesting territory with your help and that of the IGGI network.&quot;","2015","This company's notable impacts include recent National awards and commendations (CIRIA BIG Challenge). They have also extended their geographical reach from involvement in the NERC projects. The are, most notably, the only known UK company that makes commercial products for enhancing the ecological value of hard coastal infrastructure (e.g. http://www.artecology.space/vertipools/) and one of only a handful of companies doing this worldwide. What makes Artecology especially unique is that they extend these ideas across the landscape to help green the grey and often do this involving disadvantaged or vulnerable groups, with arts-based engagement activities designed to enthuse these groups to design multifunctional hard infrastructure that benefits wildlife and society. As they stated above, they have benefited and grown from their involvement in the NERC projects.","http://www.artecology.space","5aa85c716dfb99.13180253","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=5aa85c716dfb99.13180253&grantRef=NE%2FN017404%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/N017404/1","49573F92-748A-4588-BDE5-335A1EDB1889","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","AE58F21F-3622-4382-97BB-1359BD183E9F","D635A3CF-2BB1-4527-B410-B448C2CB7A00"

We have created a prototype (TRL5) and with funding from the Innovate UK ICURe programme (Innovation-to-Commercialisation of University Research), we validated our business proposition worldwide (Sept-Dec 2019). 
Our Earth Blox innovation (US Patent Office, Application No. 62/958,657, 08/01/20) lies in the complete removal of coding skills, making space data accessible to the masses, globally. 

Our vision is to remove the barriers preventing widespread adoption of global satellite data. Earth Blox democratises the power of satellite data and intelligence, by leveraging the power of cloud processing without the need for computer coding or high level Earth-observation expertise. It enables the processing of terabytes of planetary scale geospatial data and the creation and download of actionable insights with unprecedented power and ease. With its unique easy-to-use interface, Earth Blox benefits decision-makers in every sector. 

Satellites and planetary-scale data are available at unprecedented rates of acquisition for solving global challenges, ranging from deforestation, urban expansion and large-scale disaster mapping. Yet, while environmental consultancies, supply-chain managers, insurers, retail and decision-makers in public institutions want to access this information, they are hindered by the complexity, cost and skill levels required to exploit the data - Earth Blox removes these barriers. 

The market is desperate for Earth Blox:

In challenging natural environments, it also makes biomonitoring safer for clients and their employees to conduct.

NatureMetrics began trading in 2016, starting with the use of aquatic eDNA to detect Great Crested Newts at building sites. Related to this, NatureMetrics developed a filter kit for aquatic eDNA and filed a patent, now at international application Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) stage (WO2020128503A1). The company has grown very rapidly. Since 2016, it has analysed over 10,000 environmental samples from more than 20 countries across the globe for over 45 clients. For example, in 2019, NatureMetrics processed 4,750 samples from 92 clients and over 15 countries, with approximately 60% of revenue coming from commercial organisations, 20% from government, 10% from NGOs and 10% from grant-funded projects. In 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, it processed 3,285 samples from 90 clients, with approximately 68% of revenue coming from commercial organisations, 6% from government, 8% from NGOs, 10% from grant-funded projects and 8% from universities and research institutes. In June 2019, NatureMetrics raised GBP2,500,000 in a Series A investment round that was oversubscribed by 2.5 times, valuing the company at GBP7,500,000. NatureMetrics then implemented a growth plan, which has been slowed but not interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue in 2019 was GBP713,796, and revenue in 2020 was GBP1,000,976. The company's size in terms of numbers of people employed has also increased rapidly. As at December 2020, NatureMetrics had 33 employees (headcount 33, FTE 31.4), including 15 with PhDs (headcount 15, FTE 14.8). As of March 2021, NatureMetrics has 40+ employees, 18 with PhDs, and is continuing to hire.","2016","Narrowly speaking, NatureMetrics is not a spin-out because NM has not licensed IP from a university. However, it is indeed a commercialisation of NERC-funded research carried out at UK universities. Note that while the first date of business incorporation was in 2014, NatureMetrics truly began operation at the end of the NERC FoF award, when it successfully underwent its first funding round in 1Q 2016 and was able to open a lab, hire employees, and begin marketing and sales. Paraphrased from a draft of the Impact Case Study submitted by University of East Anglia for REF2020 (with most identifying information removed) Impacts on clients, practitioners, production, public policy and the environment: NatureMetrics helps clients undertake work that would be far more costly, or outright impossible, without the company's services. The eDNA sampling kits and analysis services offered by NatureMetrics make biomonitoring safer for clients and their employees to conduct in challenging natural environments. The following is a selection of leading examples of clients and spheres of activity that have benefited from NatureMetrics: NatureSpace Partnership: NatureMetrics is a key service provider to and investor in the NatureSpace Partnership, a private company operating the UK's largest biodiversity offset market. NatureMetrics's eDNA service makes it possible for NatureSpace to rapidly survey hundreds of ponds to model the distribution of the Great Crested Newt, a species protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981. Builders in surveyed areas can buy a licence to offset the effects of developments on Great Crested Newt populations, the fee rising with their modelled impact on the newt. This arrangement reduces costs and risk compared to newt relocation, while also funding the creation of four new ponds per affected pond. NatureMetrics gives environmental consultancies a competitive edge over consultants using conventional survey techniques alone. Relative to their standard methods, environmental consultancies sample more safely, cover larger areas, detect more species, and reduce survey costs. Environmental charities use NatureMetrics' environmental DNA kits to survey species and, compared to visual surveys by volunteers, are able to detect more species at lower cost. Regulatory standards-setting and end-user education: In her role as NatureMetrics's first CEO, from 2017-2020, Bruce co-led a working group of a European Union Cooperation in Science and Technology (EU COST) action, DNAqua.Net, that submitted to the European Committee for Standardization the first European Standard related to eDNA. Bruce will also be on the steering committee of the soon-to-be-launched UK Business and Biodiversity Forum, a government-supported initiative exploring ways businesses can act to reverse biodiversity declines. In 2019, Yu wrote a contracted Think Piece for the UK Government's Environment Agency for England to design an R&D strategy for incorporating DNA-based methods in the agency's reporting. In 2020, NatureMetrics was competitively selected as one of five small companies to join the UK's High Speed 2 rail (HS2) Innovation Accelerator programme, the purpose of which is to accelerate the uptake of new technologies in building the HS2 railway. NatureMetrics was chosen to ensure the quality of HS2's green corridor, including newly-created woodland.","http://www.naturemetrics.co.uk","56d49a27bccb74.78868468","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=56d49a27bccb74.78868468&grantRef=NE%2FM021696%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M021696/1","2D0E89F0-DB58-4280-92E4-931540EA359B","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","88C5F7F9-8DCC-41C9-BC4F-F37DA01075C7","8BB8D05B-4433-44F2-A676-32E73077702C"

These materials have to exhibit enhanced performance in terms of durability and mechanical strength, and incorporate functionalities that satisfy multiple uses in order to be suitable for future emerging structural applications. To address these challenges, there is a wide consensus in the research community that concrete, the most used composite construction material worldwide, has to be engineered at the nanoscale, where its chemical and physico-mechanical properties can be truly enhanced. We have developed a new technique that uses nanoengineering technology to incorporate graphene into traditional concrete production (Advanced Function Materials 2018, vol 28, page 1705183). We have reported an innovative multifunctional nanoengineered concrete composite displaying an unprecedented range of enhanced properties compared to standard concrete. These include an increase of up to 146% in the compressive strength and up to 79.5% in the flexural one while at the same time we found an enhanced electrical and thermal performance. A surprising decrease in water permeability by nearly 400% compared to the standard concrete makes this novel composite material ideally suitable for constructions in areas subject to flooding. The unprecedented gamut of functionalities that we reported are produced by the addition of water-stabilised graphene dispersions, an advancement in the emerging field of nanoengineered concrete which can be readily applied in a more sustainable, environmentally-friendly construction industry. Production of concrete accounts for up to 7% of the global CO2 emissions. Graphene reinforced concrete may have a positive impact on the environment by contributing to the decrease of carbon emissions emitted by cement manufacturing. We estimate that reducing the quantity of cement by 50% of the required concrete material while still meeting the specifications for the loading of buildings, would lead to a reduction of 446kg/tonne of the carbon emissions by the cement manufacturing which would be significant.",,"5c87c756c34101.28412256","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=5c87c756c34101.28412256&grantRef=EP%2FM002438%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M002438/1","52FEA574-862D-436B-9120-98528711C4E6","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","961756BF-E31F-4A13-836F-0A09BA02385C","FC83E865-F1F9-411B-8742-41287E921134"

Not only did the Open Planning project develop an innovative app for new perspectives on engaging with the urban planning process, it caused significant shifts in the business practices of Red Ninja and their approach to collaborative work. Lee Omar, the CEO, describes the impact on the company as follows: Having direct access to work with a local authority in a paid capacity gave us confidence and credibility, which enabled us to design and develop a solution that enables more visibility for citizens living in urban environments. The Creative Exchange process was fantastic for us as we invested much more of our own time into the project to enable us to produce IP that we could commercialise. The learning of working with the city data sets as part of the Creative Exchange has enabled us to design and develop commercial products with a multinational energy company on a smart energy platform that will enable sustainable urban developments. Commercially this was valuable to us and is worth ten times the financial reward than the Creative Exchange project. This validates the extra work we did on the Creative Exchange project. Since engaging with Creative Exchange, Red Ninja employs five times as many staff and their turnover has increased six fold. The company is also continuing the collaborative approach to work, sponsoring a programme of PhD students embedded within their practices and developing their own research arm. Additionally, as a direct result of things learned from the Open Planning project, Creative Exchange is funding a new twelve-month collaboration to develop a new platform by which public data (such as that held by city councils) can be held and provided back to relevant parties in a way that can be truly open and beneficial. It will involve working with current data handling companies to develop a new system, with the aim of scaling it across the country. It will initially be trialled in three cities: Manchester, Lancaster and Liverpool.","http://www.redninja.co.uk","57305c51a1a145.73099249","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=57305c51a1a145.73099249&grantRef=AH%2FJ005150%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/J005150/1","8D6A32E4-3CED-4B0D-A347-3519BD1B3376","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","C8DB7FEF-A19A-4B3A-BCFA-CCD37A2B2445"

Chiasma really changed the way I think about design. It changed the way I see myself and our company. The design thinking and process toolkit that you gave to designers [at Rural Economies Chiasma, 'Sustaining Rural Scotland' in Oct 2014] is something that we use for everything now. I think it's something that we did to a certain extent before, not consciously realising it was design thinking, but now we're much more conscious of it and make sure we go through that process much more on a conscious level which puts design as more of a focus on everything that we do. Developing ideas together, around a specific problem, provides an opportunity to come up with solutions together.

In particular, the need for humanitarian assistance caused by climate change has risen by 40% in the last year alone (UNOCHA,2021). We respond to the immediate need for innovation in disaster fundraising and address major challenges fundraisers face more broadly.

IF GIVE represents a spin-out from Lancaster University that is now actively engaged in commercializing a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that can facilitate an entirely new, rule-based model for charitable giving. The service enables donors to create rules using pre-specified payouts in response to real-world triggers to create a modern, interactive and highly personalised experience for donors that encourages regular engagement with their chosen causes.","2022","Through the establishment of IF GIVE LTD, the company has been invited to apply for seed funding via Innovate UK's ICure programme to support additional industrial research activities over a 12 month period. In particular, IF GIVE as a commercial entry has allowed the founding researchers to formalise and strengthen partnerships with NGOs including Oxfam Australia who are working closely with IF GIVE LTD to support design and productisation activities. As a company registered in the NW, we expect IF GIVE LTD to bring economic impacts to the region and will look to engage with smaller local charities and social good projects throughout.",,"622095961cb2d8.88700919","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=622095961cb2d8.88700919&grantRef=EP%2FT022574%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/T022574/1","46793E77-A986-4B6E-BE2C-A586CE455210","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","44160F04-5CBF-4E8E-A6C6-C0EF61A5865C","15ACB887-D6F9-4C25-B592-E635B0D41C13"

The MEND programme is for overweight and obese children aged between seven to 13 and their families. The intervention combines all the elements required in an effective response to child obesity including: 

increasing physical activity family involvement practical education in nutrition and diet behavioural change.The programme emphasises practical, fun learning to deliver sustained improvements in families' fitness levels, diets and overall health. 

The MEND programme complies with recent guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). This guidance is approved by the Department of Health (DH), the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Department for Education and Sport (DfES). 

Unlike other responses to obesity, it is not a diet and does not encourage rapid weight loss. The MEND programme is about empowerment and it puts the child at the centre. It offers a range of ways to make life changes in physical activity, food, self-confidence and personal development. By following the MEND principles, participants grow into their weight or lose it naturally. They also build a foundation for healthy living - for life.

Richard Caborn, the Minister for Sport, launched 'London on the MEND' in February 2007. It demonstrates a financial model that is replicable throughout England and Wales. Councils and PCTs each contributed one-third of project inputs - either in cash or in kind - to meet total project cost of &pound;452,000. The remaining third was financed with a grant of &pound;171,800 from the Community Investment Fund, administered by Sport England.","","We are working closely with our spin-off company MEND - the most extensive child obesity treatment programme in the UK After the successful start of 'London on the MEND', the Big Lottery Wellbeing Fund awarded &pound;8 million to support a larger initiative throughout England over four years. This funding allows 75 local partnerships to deliver the MEND programme from 231 sites. Partnerships are primarily combinations of local authorities, PCTs, schools and leisure centre operators. Almost 20,000 families will participate in the MEND programme. More than 5,000 frontline staff will receive one-day training in childhood obesity awareness. Both projects will review the effectiveness of different models of partnership working and disseminate their findings. Best practice will be highlighted in a series of articles on the IDeA website. http://www.idea.gov.uk/idk/core/page.do?pageId=6283972","http://www.mendcentral.org/","rZ3ALXwQvPp","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=rZ3ALXwQvPp&grantRef=G9425093","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=G9425093","764C6140-A323-4572-B0AA-CC0CA142E1AF","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","3A5E126D-C175-4730-9B7B-E6D8CF447F83","9C338DAD-3EFC-4EB1-AC3C-63578F056485"

This brings a 10-fold sensitivity improvement over the closest competitor, which enables a significant performance improvement in scanning and imaging capabilities. In economic terms, methane leaks from well-heads and pipelines cost the Oil and Gas industry between $6bn and $30bn a year. In the US, methane leaks from the natural gas and petroleum industry are now the number one source of methane emissions, surpassing livestock digestion and landfill.

The Acoustic-Flow technology utilises the interaction of Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) with a patient sample to drive a diagnostic test. The interactions are controlled by
microstructures patterned on the surface of disposable chips, to shape sound in particular ways in a frequency dependant manner. Functions possible include fluid movement, mixing, particle patterning, enrichment, opening cells to release DNA and temperature cycling of a sample. Acoustic-Flow technology means that samples can be processed on-chip (no preprocessing required) and complex micro-fluidics are avoided.
 
The SAW Dx business model is based on providing product and technology solutions to life sciences and diagnostics companies seeking to enhance their diagnostic product offerings through innovative point of care use.

The company is backed by a &pound;4.5m investment from the Carbon Trust and leading international specialty chemicals company Rhodia.

Eight19, so called as it takes 8 minutes and 19 seconds for light to travel from the sun to the earth, will focus its efforts on developing product prototypes utilising techniques for fabricating large scale plastic electronic devices using roll-to-roll processes developed in the CIKC?s 3PV project. The company will continue to be actively engaged with CIKC and its innovative research output through the CIKC ?3PV+? project.

The company has been created by a partnership of Professor Sir Richard Friend, Professor Henning Sirringhaus and Professor Neil Greenham with technology development company TTP through the Carbon Trust?s Advanced Photovoltaic Research Accelerator.

Solar cells made with semiconducting plastics (also known as organic photovoltaics, or OPV) offer potentially very low cost production enabled by low temperature and high throughput processing typical of plastic films, ease of installation for construction companies and simplified manufacturing integration. The market for organic solar cells has the potential to reach $500 million by 2015 and to grow four fold to $2 billion by 2020 (Nanomarkets, 2009) driven by applications such as building-integrated photovoltaics, and could save up to 900 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050 ? some 1.5 times the UK?s current annual emissions.","2010","In 2012 Eight19 announced the launch of Azuri Technologies Limited to develop its internationally recognised Indigo 'pay-as-you-go' solar technology for off-grid markets. Eight19 will concentrate on development of its printed plastic solar technology and Azuri will focus on expanding the Indigo product family and market reach. In 2012, Eight19 was crowned 'Small Business of the Year' and won the 'Renewable Energy Project of the Year' award at the BusinessGreen Leaders Awards, for its work on the Indigo pay-as-you-go solar system which provides clean and affordable electricity to off-grid rural communities. The company was also awarded the prize for Best Business Case at the Investor Forum at the annual LOPE-C Organic Electronics conference in Munich.","http://www.eight19.com","m-5942433314.344317132eab30","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=m-5942433314.344317132eab30&grantRef=EP%2FE023614%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/E023614/1","F98F6147-0CAD-46DF-AC8C-FF0FD1213E0A","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","D1774113-D5D2-4B7C-A412-66A90FE4B96F","2996A10D-439A-4F40-A698-2FE4F48E771F"

The company was formed to commercialise sensor technology developed by Professor Ben Varcoe, Chair of Quantum Information Science at Leeds University and has facilities in Leeds and in Warwickshire UK. The first application of this technology will be to aid the rapid triage and identification of patients presenting to Emergency Departments with chest pain, but who ultimately have no cardiac related diagnosis. Identifying these patients early enables them to leave expensive cardiac diagnostic pathways so releasing resources to focus on other acute patients. Creavo Medical Technologies has an experienced management team, with a mix of fundamental research, medical device commercialisation, manufacturing and global regulatory and clinical strategy.","2014","A new cardiac scanning device that could save the NHS &pound;200 million a year is being trialled at four of the UK's largest emergency departments (Bristol, Nottingham, Leicester and Sheffield). The British-made Vitalscan device, which has been developed by Creavo Medical Technologies and could revolutionise the way patients with chest pain are managed in emergency departments, works by conducting a non-invasive three to five-minute scan at a patient's bedside to rule out significant cardiac conditions, such as heart attacks. Data from the York Health Economics Consortium shows that 1.3 million A&E admissions in 2014/15 were due to chest pain. Of these, 63% ultimately had no cardiac-related condition but, the majority would still have gone through the same costly cardiac triage process of someone having a heart attack. Vitalscan has the potential to identify a significant proportion of these patients which would radically change the management of chest pain patients entering emergency departments. Conservative estimates indicate that the device could save the NHS &pound;200 million a year, the equivalent of &pound;3.85 million a week and &pound;382 a minute, easing pressure on bed space in A&E departments and reducing patient anxiety by getting patients to the correct treatment more quickly. Steve Parker, CEO Creavo Medical Technologies says: Cardiac-related chest pain is one of the biggest issues facing emergency departments in the western world due to the economic burden it places on healthcare services and the disruption it causes to inpatient care. The triage process for someone entering an emergency department with chest pain can take anywhere from six to 24 hours which places a huge amount of strain on resources. Early results from smaller sets of clinical trials indicate that Vitalscan can quickly identify and rule out significant ischemic heart disease so it prevents patients who aren't suffering from a cardiac-related condition from having to go through the lengthy, costly chest pain triage process, easing the burden on emergency departments at a time when they are facing unprecedented pressures. Creavo Medical Technologies was established to commercialise the work undertaken by Professor Ben Varcoe at the University of Leeds to develop Vitalscan, a portable, passive magnetocardiography device that measures the electromagnetic fluctuations of the heart, while maintaining the accuracy and efficacy of older SQUID devices. The start of clinical trials at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, North Bristol NHS Trust and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust marks the largest ever clinical trial of a magnetocardiography device. This will be followed by a second stage starting at three centres in the United States at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Cincinnati and Baylor Texas.","http://creavomedtech.com/","58b5990d7762b4.47100543","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=58b5990d7762b4.47100543&grantRef=EP%2FJ017620%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/J017620/1","8611F984-F2D7-4983-B268-9A81FBA36BD7","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","2DD4AB06-923B-44AF-AA55-1A50255C1FBE"

We have a hybrid business model of wholly-owned programmes and partnerships with pharma, biotech and academics.

The Company was founded as a spin-out from the University of Manchester and has a highly experienced management team and Board who have delivered significant value creation within the healthcare sector historically.","2008","C4X Discovery operates a hybrid business model of a wholly owned pipeline of discovery programmes plus partnerships with global and international companies, from top 10 pharma through to biotech. The Company is partnered with the Structural Genomic Consortium to assist with the identification and validation of new drug targets and has several active research collaborations with academic institutions. By 2012 Conformetrix disclosed its first collaborative deal with AstraZeneca. Mike Snowden, Vice President and Head of Discovery Sciences, AstraZeneca, said at the time: We are excited to be working with Conformetrix. We believe their technology will provide a powerful addition to our hit identification and lead optimization approaches, supporting our strategic objectives to improve the quality and choice of candidate compounds for our early pipeline. In addition to an undisclosed upfront payment, Conformetrix received research funding and was eligible for milestones as certain targets are met. At the end of 2012 Conformetrix announced that it had used its technology to generate a series of potent orexin (OX-1) antagonists, with plans to progress to drug leads. Orexin is a neurotransmitter believed to play a role in a broad range of behavioral conditions, from sleep disorders to addiction. In 2013 Conformetrix was rebranded to C4XDiscovery Ltd and in the same year announced how its proprietary NMR-based technology could be used to solve the dynamic solution-structure of a small molecule antagonist of the Class B GPCR corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRF-1R) in just seven days. In 2014 C4XDiscovery announced new collaboration deals with Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Evotec AG. Furthermore, the company published further positive data and announced a patent filing for its selective OX-1 inhibitor programme for stress-related addictive disorders. On the basis of these positive corporate results, and to maintain investment in C4XDiscovery's programmes, the company successfully floated on the London Stock Exchange in an Oct 2014 IPO, valuing the company at &pound;31m.

The company was formed to commercialise sensor technology developed by Professor Ben Varcoe, Chair of Quantum Information Science at Leeds University and has facilities in Leeds and in Warwickshire UK. The first application of this technology will be to aid the rapid triage and identification of patients presenting to Emergency Departments with chest pain, but who ultimately have no cardiac related diagnosis. Identifying these patients early enables them to leave expensive cardiac diagnostic pathways so releasing resources to focus on other acute patients. Creavo Medical Technologies has an experienced management team, with a mix of fundamental research, medical device commercialisation, manufacturing and global regulatory and clinical strategy.","2014","A new cardiac scanning device that could save the NHS &pound;200 million a year is being trialled at four of the UK's largest emergency departments (Bristol, Nottingham, Leicester and Sheffield). The British-made Vitalscan device, which has been developed by Creavo Medical Technologies and could revolutionise the way patients with chest pain are managed in emergency departments, works by conducting a non-invasive three to five-minute scan at a patient's bedside to rule out significant cardiac conditions, such as heart attacks. Data from the York Health Economics Consortium shows that 1.3 million A&E admissions in 2014/15 were due to chest pain. Of these, 63% ultimately had no cardiac-related condition but, the majority would still have gone through the same costly cardiac triage process of someone having a heart attack. Vitalscan has the potential to identify a significant proportion of these patients which would radically change the management of chest pain patients entering emergency departments. Conservative estimates indicate that the device could save the NHS &pound;200 million a year, the equivalent of &pound;3.85 million a week and &pound;382 a minute, easing pressure on bed space in A&E departments and reducing patient anxiety by getting patients to the correct treatment more quickly. Steve Parker, CEO Creavo Medical Technologies says: Cardiac-related chest pain is one of the biggest issues facing emergency departments in the western world due to the economic burden it places on healthcare services and the disruption it causes to inpatient care. The triage process for someone entering an emergency department with chest pain can take anywhere from six to 24 hours which places a huge amount of strain on resources. Early results from smaller sets of clinical trials indicate that Vitalscan can quickly identify and rule out significant ischemic heart disease so it prevents patients who aren't suffering from a cardiac-related condition from having to go through the lengthy, costly chest pain triage process, easing the burden on emergency departments at a time when they are facing unprecedented pressures. Creavo Medical Technologies was established to commercialise the work undertaken by Professor Ben Varcoe at the University of Leeds to develop Vitalscan, a portable, passive magnetocardiography device that measures the electromagnetic fluctuations of the heart, while maintaining the accuracy and efficacy of older SQUID devices. The start of clinical trials at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, North Bristol NHS Trust and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust marks the largest ever clinical trial of a magnetocardiography device. This will be followed by a second stage starting at three centres in the United States at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Cincinnati and Baylor Texas.","http://creavomedtech.com/","58b5990d7762b4.47100543","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=58b5990d7762b4.47100543&grantRef=EP%2FG032483%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/G032483/1","F5A856A0-1962-4264-87D4-F1E0C9E4093E","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","83D87776-5958-42AE-889D-B8AECF16B468","2DD4AB06-923B-44AF-AA55-1A50255C1FBE"

"MRC","MC_PC_13034","Research Grant","Spin Outs","Imperial College London",,"Rueckert","Daniel","","IXICO","IXICO was co-founded by Professor Rueckert in 2004. IXICO's innovative technologies help those involved in researching and treating serious diseases to make rapid decisions and improve patient outcomes. Its clinical focus is predominantly dementia, but IXICO also support clinical studies for other disease areas in the field of neuro-degeneration and beyond.

IXICO works with many of the leading pharmaceutical companies providing clinical trial services and technology to evaluate imaging endpoints as part of their drug development pipelines. Its medical image management and analysis products are used by the global pharmaceutical industry to select patients for clinical trials and to assess the safety and efficacy of drugs in development.","2004","Economic impacts IXICO had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry where medical imaging is rapidly becoming an important tool in clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs using imaging biomarkers. IXICO's imaging biomarkers provide several benefits to pharmaceutical companies: In concept trials of AD therapies the developed biomarkers allow pharmaceutical companies to power their studies with fewer subjects. The developed imaging biomarkers do provide evidence of efficacy with around 100 subjects per arm (an arm in a clinical trial refers to any of the treatment groups in a randomized trial. Most randomized trials have two arms, e.g. untreated vs. treated groups) over 12 months rather than 400 or so per arm needed for cognitive testing. Based on a conservative cost estimate of $30k per subject enrolled, this provides a significant cost saving for the companies. Similarly, pharmaceutical companies use the developed imaging biomarkers to enrich their clinical trials. In the context of clinical trials, such enrichment allows the identification of a population of patients in whom a drug effect, if present, is more likely to be demonstrable. In AD trials that use the developed biomarkers, an increase in the conversion rate in a prodromal Alzheimer's trial from 40% to 60% saves 30% off the cost of a pair of pivotal trials that used progression free survival as an endpoint, and which might otherwise cost $800m - $1bn. Impacts on public policy and services The imaging biomarkers developed in the underpinning research have had a significant impact on informing the development of new guidelines for the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and low hippocampal volume in regulatory clinical trials: It now seems likely that to modify the course of Alzheimer's Disease, it is necessary to start the treatment in the pre-dementia (or prodromal) phase. The identification of patients at this stage can only be done confidently with the help of biomarkers: imaging provides a non-invasive alternative to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for this purpose. The critical importance of imaging biomarkers in AD trials has been recognised by the CAMD consortium by submitting to regulators an application to qualify low hippocampal volume as a biomarker. This submission - approved by EMA and currently under review by the FDA - incorporates key data obtained using the underpinning research described here: the availability of this technology, with the regulatory qualification, is having global impact on the design of future trials of AD medicines in the pre-dementia population. In particular, the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has issued a positive opinion on the use of MRI to measure hippocampal volume as a tool to enrich recruitment into regulated clinical trials in the pre-dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease, in which the EMA directly refers to IXICO's technology. This was the first imaging-based biomarker to be qualified by a regulatory agency. Impacts on healthcare The imaging biomarkers developed in the underpinning research have been so effective in clinical trials that IXICO has recently decided also to develop products for diagnostic use (Brain Health Centre). IXICO's product for diagnostics directly uses the methods described in reference of the underpinning research and has also been CE marked. It is currently undergoing trials involving 200 patients as part of new NHS brain health centres.","http://www.ixico.com","546120d6292d26.94941786","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=spinout&outcomeId=546120d6292d26.94941786&grantRef=MC_PC_13034","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=MC_PC_13034","1732801D-717E-47D2-9669-740766B49510","C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C","46387D84-F71E-4B7D-8C7D-9C288F113510","DC72772A-60E1-4295-8D44-47F448452680"
