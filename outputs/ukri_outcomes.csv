"NERC","NE/M000346/1","Research Grant","Artistic and Creative Products","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Bromiley","Geoffrey",NA,"Work with artist Matthew C. Wilson","Along the lines of the theme of the consortium, Matthew and I formulated a project based on the concept of habitable other Earth's. We conducted experiments to simulate to the interior of an Earth-twin exoplanet saturated in carbonic acid. The starting mix was based on a model for the composition of the 'rocky' part of the Earth, known as 'pyrolite'. Pyrolite is a useful model for the composition of the Earth at depths of hundreds of kilometres. As such, this composition allows us to explore, through high pressure and high temperature experiments, the interior of an Earth-like exoplanet. In contrast to the Earth, however, we modified this pyrolite model so that it was saturated in carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is formed by the reaction of H2O with CO2 (water with carbon dioxide). On the surface of the Earth, water dissolves small amounts of carbon dioxide; surface water is very weak carbonic acid. Industrially elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase water acidity, which has severe effects on marine ecosystems. We are literally acidifying the planet we live on. Our model exoplanet explores an extreme outcome of this: an Earth-like planet catastrophically altered by millennia of industrialisation, and saturated in carbonic acid.
The starting mix was prepared by combining powdered oxides, hydroxides and carbonates of various elements. Small amounts of this mix were packed into platinum capsules which were then welded shut. Experiments were performed using a piston-cylinder apparatus at pressures of 2 GPa (approximately 20,000 times atmospheric pressure, equivalent to a depth of approximately 65 km). One experiment was run at 1000 degrees C, and one at 1400 degrees C, both for 48 hours to allow reaction to occur. These temperatures were chosen to investigate 'normal' or 'stable' regions of a planet saturated in carbonic acid, and regions where heating resulted in melting and production of magma, respectively.
 
We saw some really interesting things when we observed the recovered samples using a scanning electron microscope. The lower temperature experiments contain the same combination of minerals we would expect to find at equivalent depth in the Earth, although in a more oxidised form. Pressure promotes formation of carbonic acid. However, at high pressure and temperature this acid oxidises rocks; it literally pumps extra oxygen into the minerals. In some ways this is similar to the use of carbonic acid as a restorative gas (i.e. what you told me about James Watt and his invalid son). The higher temperature experiment has a combination of 'rock' and magma (liquid rock); the conditions we used provide a snapshot of a volcanic process where heat and carbonic acid cause the planet to melt. Once again, carbonic acid has oxidised the material. The magma is quenched to glass imperfectly, so that we capture small crystals starting to form, and bubbles of carbon dioxide forming. Textures suggest that this magma had a very unusual composition; carbonic acid was fully dissolved in the melt, but was slowly released as carbon dioxide and then water as the magma crystallised. 
 
In our hypothetic exoplanet, carbon dioxide and water and forced together deep within the planet to form a highly concentrated acid. However, this acid oxidises the planet, in the same way that iron rusts on the surface of the Earth. Volcanic activity on our exoplanet returns carbonic acid to the surface as both water and carbon dioxide, also producing unusual carbonatite volcanoes, similar to Ol Doinyo Lengai in Tanzania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol_Doinyo_Lengai).","Artwork",2019,"-vdrome film &quot;Geological evidences&quot;; this platform provides give high profile to short films; curators include the Tate Modern's film curator: https://www.vdrome.org/matthew-c-wilson

"AHRC","AH/M009270/1","Research Grant","Artistic and Creative Products","University of Edinburgh","Edinburgh College of Art","Brennan","Matt","http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0308-7300","Jo Mango & Friends : 'Wrack Lines' Music EP","Back in 2007, while on a tour with cult singer-songwriter Vashti Bunyan, sitting on her third aeroplane of the day in a holding pattern above an American city, Jo Mango had a revelation about the potential impact of her itinerant job on the world and on herself. That moment led to some serious decisions about her lifestyle and an ongoing fascination with exploring the sustainability (or un-sustainability) of the musical life. 
Her new EP, Wrack Lines, is an extension of those thoughts into a research project for which Jo enlisted the help of leading Scottish singer-songwriters Rachel Sermanni, RM Hubbert, Louis Abbott (Admiral Fallow) and The Pictish Trail. The songs they have written together explore a gamut of emotions related to travel, the environment and music. 
The title &quot;Wrack Lines&quot; refers to the name given to the waving line of detritus that is left on the beach once the tide goes out. It calls to mind images of travelling across the ocean, but also the unmistakable residue of waste that is left behind us when we do. It is also an image of the creation of music (which itself is made from waves). 
There are songs that are an expression of the need to keep moving and to keep finding new audiences to gain the kind of catharsis that makes life worth living. Others explore the off-kilter rhythms of living on the road. There is the tension between the material and the ephemeral: loneliness and exhaustion of constant travelling versus the uplifting glories of the nature of musical performance; the concrete and objective nature of the resources that we use up in order to reach audiences versus the un-measurable and immaterial aspects of the music that is given back in return.

As players acquire skills, they are able to complete tasks for three different social enterprises who all work towards Edinburgh's lack of pizza in three different ways.

One More Slice - who focus on producing the perfect crust and best cooked pizza.
Pizza First - who seek a sustainable future for pizza lovers and focus on sourcing the best and most ethical ingredients.
Everyone Loves Pizza - who focus on being able to produce and deliver high volumes of pizza to as many people who need it.
The social enterprises are scored on their ability to find volunteers who can complete tasks at varying levels of difficulty.

Our real motivation is to use Pizza Block as a metaphor, introducing participants to digital blockchain identity management systems by producing a number of physical artefacts which relate back to components of digital blockchain identity management systems:

A personal ledger, unique to each volunteer which shows the order in which they learnt skills and completed jobs. This could be simply seen as a volunteering CV.
A public ledger which both volunteers and social enterprises can check if there is any question over the volunteers claimed skills.
The social enterprises have a record of completed jobs with a snapshot of the skills of the volunteer who completed each job.
These physical artefacts provide starting points for conversations revolving around how blockchain IMS could be used in the future.","Artefact (including digital)",2018,"TBD","http://oxchain.uk/2019/01/29/pizza-block/","5c8932289d0915.59398312","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=5c8932289d0915.59398312&grantRef=EP%2FN028198%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N028198/1","3185E56D-29F0-4D43-B965-F2B9B1895C45","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","ADDE3750-CED3-4CA4-A303-BAD32A0C4A82",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/N028198/1","University of Edinburgh","Edinburgh College of Art","Research Grant","Speed","Chris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ox-Chain: Towards secure and trustworthy circular economies through distributed ledger technologies","31/08/2016","31/10/2020",992269,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N028198/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","ADDE3750-CED3-4CA4-A303-BAD32A0C4A82","Edinburgh College of Art","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

It will incorporate a range of existing and new interactive installations and activities from interdisciplinary research projects. As an important environmental indicator with rich global cultural and social heritage, the honeybee is a potent symbol. As evidenced by our previous extensive public engagement activities, this complex and fascinating insect captures the imagination - everyone has a bee story!

Take part in our Beespoon installation and find out how much honey a single bee makes in its lifetime!
• Our Beespoon is 1/12th the size of a teaspoon and represents the amount of honey a single bee can make within her lifetime. Help us to think about the work of a bee by doing some work to try and fill the beespoon! By making an origami flower and placing it on our wall display, you will earn the chance to press the beespoon installation button. If you're lucky, a drop of honey will fall onto the beespoon, filling it up, drop by drop. 
• This activity allows participants to engage in the act of making, learning about how little honey a single bee makes, and leading them to reflect on the honey that they might put on their breakfast toast, how many bees it takes to make a jar of honey, and how far a single bee will fly during its lifetime. We will ask participants to think about their own life-times achievement. 

Design a beehive!
• What are honeybees and what are they for? This activity introduces participants to different kinds of beehive that are designed to encourage bees to do different kinds of things: bees can make honey, they pollinate flowers which produces fruit and vegetables, they rear their young, they guard their colony, and they exchange information by dancing on the honeycomb. We will design posters to explain how different beehives work, introduce the importance of the 'beespace' to honeybee architecture, and then ask participants to design their own hive
• This activity will encourage participants to reflect on how human perceptions of honeybees lead us to reach into and shape honeybee worlds

Feel like a bee, feel like a beekeeper

• Make a pair of bee glasses, and see the world from the perspective of a bee. Bees have five eyes - two of which are compound eyes, each with its own lens that looks in a different direction. Can you imagine what it would be like to inhabit a world that looks like this? 
• Learn to interpret the waggle dance, and draw a map to find out how bees show each other where the best flowers are. 
• Learn how a beekeeper uses their eyes to spot the queen, larvae, and worker bees on a virtual frame from a beehive; their ears to listen to the sounds of the hive and find out what they mean; and their nose to smell the scent of a healthy hive","Artistic/Creative Exhibition",2017,"Ongoing - the event is in April 2017",NA,"58c9b15e21c045.87387236","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=58c9b15e21c045.87387236&grantRef=ES%2FM000834%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/M000834/1","12A0E1A0-D0EC-4C84-A9D1-129CA5EE51E9","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","545D3041-8FF6-4BB9-BCFE-7DC5ED222EA8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ESRC","ES/M000834/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Social and Political Science","Research Grant","Marsland","Rebecca",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Beelines","31/08/2014","30/08/2016",186085,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/M000834/1","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","545D3041-8FF6-4BB9-BCFE-7DC5ED222EA8","School of Social and Political Science","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

This exhibit will create an interactive discussion of the untapped potential of data to convey both artistic and scientific meaning, including new work exploring Arctic environmental change.
 
Environmental data and computer algorithms contain patterns that can inform both scientific findings and artistic expression. This exhibit will create an interactive discussion with participants about the untapped potential of data to convey artistic meaning. The displayed works are an exploration of the theme of 'Our Connected World' by demonstrating the connections between art, scientific data and environmental change.
 
The exhibit additionally includes new work that is a collaboration between artist Simon Sloan, communicators and scientists at the University of Edinburgh to create visualisations of data collected during field expeditions to the Canadian Arctic (http://teamshrub.wordpress.com/). This new digital art will explore Arctic ecosystems undergoing climate and environmental change - connecting the seeming distant Arctic to our daily lives in Edinburgh.
 
Simon Sloan, a recent graduate from Glasgow School of Art has a passion to combine digital media with the natural environment (http://simonsloan.com/). He has developed skills to create interactive installations and data visualisations, with successful exhibitions held in Edinburgh Maker Faire, Glasgow Degree Show and London New Designers.

To explore the people's connections with the animals they farmed, and how these connections were in turn defined by the landscape around them. Farming is not just about economics, farming physically shapes the land and ties people into an intimate relationship with the animals. These stories are also intended as a reminder that farming has never stood still, and has always had to respond to change, whether environmental, social or technical. The stories were informed by data gathered during the research project and was the result of iteration between the author and project members.","Artefact (including digital)",2021,"It is too soon to note impacts.",NA,"62028d3710c837.17763816","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=artisticandcreativeproduct&outcomeId=62028d3710c837.17763816&grantRef=BB%2FR005796%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/R005796/1","AFFDA2C6-C89C-47A9-9048-5005B53135B2","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","5E9B5D29-CF31-4456-9CC7-237E5E39FE40",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BB/R005796/1","University of Edinburgh","Science  Technology & Innovation Studies","Research Grant","Bruce","Ann",NA,"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5812-5605",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The role of livestock in food system resilience in remote, upland regions","05/03/2018","29/09/2022",399169,NA,"Scotland","Active","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/R005796/1","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","5E9B5D29-CF31-4456-9CC7-237E5E39FE40","School of Social and Political Science","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

PACT facilities bring together a comprehensive range of integrated pilot-scale and accompanying specialist research and analytical facilities, supported by leading academic expertise. The purpose of PACT is to support and catalyse industrial and academic R&D in order to accelerate the development and commercialisation of novel technologies for carbon capture and clean power generation. PACT facilities bridge the gap between bench-scale R&D and large-scale industrial pilot trials, enabling users to develop and demonstrate their technologies to provide the necessary commercial confidence before committing to the significant costs of large-scale trails. PACT offers a cost-effective and comprehensive research capability by consolidating state-of-the-art facilities and providing shared access to industry and academia. PACT Core facilities located in Beighton near Sheffield facility incorporates two 300kW gas turbines and a 250kW pulverised fuel (coal/biomass /co-firing) air/oxy rig, both systems integrated with a (1) 1 tonne/day amine capture plant for post combustion capture (PCC) research and (2) a synthetic gas mixing facility, enabling modulation of real or generation of synthetic flue/process gasses for oxyfuel and PCC for power generation and industrial applications; pilot scale facilities are supported by comprehensive state of the art online and laboratory analytical capability.

PACT facilities bring together a comprehensive range of integrated pilot-scale and accompanying specialist research and analytical facilities, supported by leading academic expertise. The purpose of PACT is to support and catalyse industrial and academic R&D in order to accelerate the development and commercialisation of novel technologies for carbon capture and clean power generation. PACT facilities bridge the gap between bench-scale R&D and large-scale industrial pilot trials, enabling users to develop and demonstrate their technologies to provide the necessary commercial confidence before committing to the significant costs of large-scale trails. PACT offers a cost-effective and comprehensive research capability by consolidating state-of-the-art facilities and providing shared access to industry and academia. PACT Core facilities located in Beighton near Sheffield facility incorporates two 300kW gas turbines and a 250kW pulverised fuel (coal/biomass /co-firing) air/oxy rig, both systems integrated with a (1) 1 tonne/day amine capture plant for post combustion capture (PCC) research and (2) a synthetic gas mixing facility, enabling modulation of real or generation of synthetic flue/process gasses for oxyfuel and PCC for power generation and industrial applications; pilot scale facilities are supported by comprehensive state of the art online and laboratory analytical capability. PACT Satellite Facilities in Edinburgh Comprise ACCTROM - a mobile laboratory for long term, on site testing and evaluation of capture media for PCC applications. PACT Satellite Facilities in Cranfield Comprise Dense Phase CO2 Transport Facility for exploring the impact of contaminants on pipeline materials behaviour; 750kWth Burner Rig - large frame gas turbines with downstream high temperature deposition and materials testing; UK's largest 75kWth Chemical Looping Rig; 150kWth PF Combustion Rig and a 250kWth CFB Combustor/Gasifier. PACT Satellite Facilities in Nottingham Through recent expansion new state of the art analytical facilities at Nottingham have also been made available to wider users through the PACT. Industrial and other stakeholder involvement in research The UKCCSRC PACT Core facilities have recently completed/are currently involved in 18 research projects including industry-academia collaborative projects funded by industry, DECC and the EPSRC, and academic projects funded through NERC and EPSRC-UKCCSRC research programme. The projects involve 30 universities and 40 industrial and other organisations. The total project value exceeds &pound;32m with nearly &pound;2m income to PACT over 5 years. 67% of PACT's project income is from collaborative projects with industry. PACT is also involved in the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Bioenergy and in Carbon Capture and Storage and Cleaner Fossil Energy providing hands on training on the facilities for a total of up to 20 students a year; the total value of the centres is &pound;7.8m with 5 academic and 70 other partner organisations. Utilisation The PACT core facilities have had nearly 170% utilisation to date and over 300% utilisation last year. To date around 692 days have been allocated to the above committed/completed projects to end of financial year 2016/17 with 360 days already utilised. This represents 150% utilisation with the level expected to rise with further projects over the next years.

This has recently been followed by a project aimed at applying geochemical tools to constrain the origin of elevated CO2 levels in offshore Brazilian hydrocarbon fields.","New-ICCARE project:
Total had realised that isotope coupling had become a powerful tool to constrain the origin of fluids and a robust means to determine the rates of fluid migration in academic studies. However, this had only been applied to large scale geological models, meaning that the existing techniques were unsuitable for inclusion in predictive reservoir models. The over-arching aim of the New-ICCARE project was to incorporate reservoir and thermodynamic modelling into the existing state of the art isotope coupling techniques.
UoE scientists evaluated the role that noble gas isotope geochemistry can play in determining the origin of natural CO2-rich fluids contaminating an unconventional field where hydrocarbon production has been stimulated by hydraulic fracturing (fracking), and the development a new method to determine the static reservoir connectivity using noble gases within the Tormore hydrocarbon discovery of the UK North Sea.

CO2 source and fluid organisation project: 
The pre-salt reservoirs of the offshore Brazilian and Angolan Atlantic margins are known to have a complex fluid history. They are composed of a mixture of hydrocarbon fluids and variable amounts of CO2. It is known that this CO2 has a predominantly magmatic source linked to rifting, associated transfer zones, or to mantle plumes. The timing of CO2 charge is dependent on its source and the duration of the related magmatism, which has an important impact on the ability for hydrocarbon fluids to enter reservoirs or spill from them, or be diluted with CO2.

The UoE team provided an integration of noble gas tracing constrains to the reservoir fluid charging history (HC+CO2) with basin modelling. Selected samples from pre-salt reservoirs were analysed, and compared to existing fluid databases from the two margins. This showed that the CO2 was unequivocally from a deep mantle origin, allowing the identification of high risk areas where deep crustal faults related to the Atlantic opening intersected with shallow basin related faults.",2015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/K036033/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Gilfillan","Stuart","Matthew",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fingerprinting captured CO2 using natural tracers: Determining CO2 fate and proving ownership","01/12/2013","29/07/2016",236177,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K036033/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","A117F0F0-E2EE-4D31-9C10-6BE4EE8936EA","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

The researcher was commissioned to write a report on how the finance sector measures and manages risk and how this might inform such policy. Whilst the report was primarily focused on finance techniques it was also supplemented with examples of how this might impact on forest policy using the experiences from the NERC funded risk projects.

A Forestry Commission Scotland representative met the researcher at a meeting to discuss uncertainty in planning for risk relating to plant health. FCS were commissioning reports from different sectors to see if lessons from other sectors on how they manage risk, could inform policy on climate change adaptation in Scottish forests. The researcher was commissioned to write a report on how the finance sector measures and manages risk and how this might inform such policy. Whilst the report was primarily focused on finance techniques it was also supplemented with examples of how this might impact on forest policy using the experiences from the NERC funded risk projects. Plus the collaboration was forged following the meeting at which the researcher introduced finance techniques to the discussion on plant health which she was invited to during the case study project.","As above, commissioning the report on how lessons on risk management from the finance sector could support forest policy decisions on climate change adaptation in Scottish forestry.",2015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/J019720/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Patenaude","Genevieve",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Case studies for the development of a forest-specific risk toolbox for investment","21/10/2013","20/04/2015",100502,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/J019720/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","D0B0A976-3651-4CBC-8603-F77621F6066A","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

Participation reflected the progress made in the associated grants of building industry-grade, US DoD level secure global systems that integrated academic supercomputing facilities with commercial systems across political, legal and geographic boundaries, at a global scale. 

This event is part of developing the above research-council funded work to support a global networked carbon market infrastructure that helps improve the efficiency of mitigation measures and moves towards a single market price for carbon across the world. This is a highly interdisciplinary project that requires competence in a number of key areas and in this workshop we focus on methods for evaluating NDCs' emission reduction efforts and assesses their economic costs. Whilst actual costs are shown to be higher than least-cost mitigation measures, on the other hand, these costs need to be compared with the beneficial effects of NDCs on Sustainable Development Goals. This optimisation is the subject of related presentations from different groups in the US, Italy and Japan, followed by a panel discussion about solutions to achieve technical innovation and societal objectives effectively. 

Lloyd co-presented: &quot;Permissioned Innovation: Building a Distributed Ledger Infrastructure for Networking Global Carbon Markets under Article 6&quot; that outlined an innovative, practical and feasible model for moving from the aspirations of the Paris Agreement to the reality of mitigation outcomes being transferred internationally as envisaged by Article 6, paragraph 2. Reflecting the hybrid top-down rules/bottom-up pledge and review nature of the Paris Agreement, we bring together the high-level considerations of how to achieve technical innovation and societal objectives effectively, with the nuts-and-bolts, on the ground, 'how to do it' of making innovation a reality. 

At this event, Lloyd was co-organiser, speaker and panel member, with three other members of the 'DLT4NCM' team participating as speakers and/or panel members: Justin Macinante, School of Law, The University of Edinburgh; Adrian Jackson (EPCC - National Supercomputing Centre, The University of Edinburgh) and Markus H&uuml;wener (team member and market specialist, previously CEO of the world's first asset management company in the Climate Change sector).

The presentation shared the conclusions outlined under narrative elsewhere in research fish,and additional conclusions. The main findings as shared were as follows:

We report on a UK government funded research project of Scotland's largest network of communities engaged in environmental education and behavioural change, Ecocongregations Scotland. We conducted research in 20% of network churches, including sixty in depth interviews, and achieved a good geographical spread from Orkney and North Uist to the lowland cities and the Borders. Our principal findings:

Almost all churches in the network had an 'eco' pioneer who formed a 'green group' which encouraged church members and the kirk session to engage in environmental behaviours and educational activities to raise awareness.

Environmental behaviours stimulated by 'green groups' included installation of low energy church lighting; church collections of batteries, printer cartridges and other post-consumer waste not well managed by local government; turning down church heating; draft proofing / insulating church buildings; changing church and household energy accounts to renewable energy providers; providing annual audits for church building and members of their carbon footprints; encouraging car sharing for church meetings; holding public-facing environmental educational events on climate change etc; engaging church members in community gardening, beach or river bed clean-ups; visiting primary schools to give talks about caring for the environment; investigating and installing renewable energy for church heating and electricity such as biomass boilers and rooftop solar and small wind turbines.
Church of Scotland churches more inclined to join the Ecocongregations network than others; Ecocongregations offices located in CofS HQ in 121 George street; CofS is more lay led than other churches so a lay green champion is able to form a green group, present reports and proposals to the kirk session without formal appointment by a salaried clergy person. 
Location of church in local communities provides a public space for environmental engagement and for community mobilisation around projects such as environmental clean-ups, community gardening, car sharing. 

Some used environmental engagement as a way of extending the appeal of the church in a social context of declining interest in religion, including engagement of younger families. 
Potential of churches as community eco-pioneers is under-realised. Very few had PV installations or visible exterior markers of pro-environmental values or behaviours. But we obtained limited evidence that where the church had led on e.g. PV installation, its visibility prompted householder installations.
Environmental values in the network included: 
intention to preserve a stable climate and rich biodiversity for future generations;
intention to mitigate suffering from climate change already being experienced by poor farmers in developing world countries with strong church links such as Malawi;
desire for churches to lead broader political and economic environmental behaviours - for example by divesting pension funds from fossil fuel companies;

The event was chaired by Mr. Amanuel Giorgio (Eritrean Mission to the UN), and included presentations by Essam Yassin Mohamed (IIED) on ecosystem services valuation, David Jonhson (GOBI) on the role of area based management measures for achieving SDG 14, and Daniela Diz on key messages from ESPA fisheries projects for the implementation of SDG 14 and other relevant SDGs. Some of the side event participants included: Alfonso Ascencio-Herrera (Mexico), Legal Counsel and Deputy to the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority (ISA); Sandor Mulsow (Chile), Director of ISA's Office of Environmental Management and Mineral Resources; Chapi Mwango, Chief, Contract Management Unit, ISA; Jessica Battle (WWF International), Nebil Said Ibris, Counsellor, Permanent Mission of Eritrea to the UN, Prof. Murray Roberts (University of Edinburgh); a number of researchers from South America, among others.&nbsp;Participants actively engaged in discussions after the presentations.

This side event demonstrated the complex nature of poverty alleviation, especially in light of a changing climate, and how the ecosystem services framework can help identify appropriate conservation and management measures, as well as beneficiaries and the most vulnerable in society, and inform decision-making processes and trade-offs in the context of an ecosystem approach, and how the multiple dimensions of poverty relevant to multiple SDGs have been addressed by ESPA fisheries-related projects.

Call for Participation

Many early adopters of sustainable smart city technology employed a technocratic approach. The dominant visions of these future cities, such as in the &quot;eco smart city&quot; [19], address environmental sustainability through the optimisation and rationalisation of urban processes, making them more efficient and therefore more sustainable. However, critics claim that such approaches are too simplistic, are unable to deal with the complexities of real, messy cities [19] and perform sustainability in specific ways that leave little room for participation and citizen agency [7,11,19]. Furthermore, the technocratic approach limited the actual social benefit people could expect from their urban habitat, and this has led to a participatory turn in smart cities [e.g. [1,12]. For example, many local governments have started using human-centred and participatory design for the integration of technology in urban environments to address issues of sustainability.

However, the turn to participation within smart cities fails to address a human-exceptionalist notion of cities, in which urban space is designed for, and inhabited by, humans only. Within the age of the Anthropocene - a term used to refer to a new geological era in which human activity is transforming earth systems [16], accelerating climate change and causing mass extinctions [18] - a human-centred perspective is increasingly seen as untenable. In fields such as STS [10,13], environmental humanities [15,17], geography [2,21], planning [16], design [5,8,25] and HCI [24], scholars are expanding and challenging traditional binaries of Western thought such as City/Nature, Human/Non-human, to consider the entanglements between human and nonhuman worlds including in urban contexts, and the ways in which we can conduct participatory research in morethan- human worlds, in order to overcome problematic narratives of human privilege and exceptionalism.

The aim of this interdisciplinary workshop is to move the field of participatory design for sustainable smart cities forward by bringing together designers, practitioners, and researchers to explore what it means to co-design genuinely sustainable cities that take into account the ways in which cities and nature, and humans and non-humans are interrelated and interdependent, for the co-creation of environmentally and socially just postanthropocentric cities. We aim to develop new conceptions that move away from traditional binaries and open up new possibilities for thinking about participatory design for urban environments in hybrid digital-physical space. We also aim to explore practical ideas about how more-than-human perspectives can shape actual participatory design practices and policies related to cities. For example, we might explore design responses to new legal rights of non-humans such as trees and rivers [20] and how their participation is negotiated in urban processes in hybrid digitalphysical space [4].
Workshop Topics of Interests

The topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to the following:

 Participatory design and use of smart cities, urban informatics and IoT technologies that explore human/morethan- human relations;
 Methodological approaches, including opportunities and challenges for designing in more-than-human worlds;
 Speculative designs, design fictions, and art projects;
 Ethical and legal considerations, e.g. design responses to a new legal status of nature; • Designs that decentre the human or privilege other species;
 Cultural aspects of sustainable smart cities in this space;
 Theoretical perspectives from the literature e.g. Anthropocene, Capitalocene [18], Chthulucene [13], and;
 &quot;World-making&quot;, what could a more-than-human city be?

Audience

We welcome researchers and practitioners working on design cases, prototype development and artistic installations, as well as those working on theoretical, critical, legal, or ethical perspectives, including those from STS, environmental humanities, and other disciplines. We welcome methodological contributions, such as object-oriented ontology [3], non-human ethnographies [22], speculative design, and actor-network and assemblage theories related to decentring the human in design.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ESRC","ES/N007018/1","University of Edinburgh","Edinburgh College of Art","Research Grant","Speed","Chris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"After Money: If you change the representation of value, does it change the values that you can represent?","29/02/2016","14/05/2018",199195,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/N007018/1","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","ADDE3750-CED3-4CA4-A303-BAD32A0C4A82","Edinburgh College of Art","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

In fields such as STS [10,13], environmental humanities [15,17], geography [2,21], planning [16], design [5,8,25] and HCI [24], scholars are expanding and challenging traditional binaries of Western thought such as City/Nature, Human/Non-human, to consider the entanglements between human and nonhuman worlds including in urban contexts, and the ways in which we can conduct participatory research in morethan- human worlds, in order to overcome problematic narratives of human privilege and exceptionalism.

The aim of this interdisciplinary workshop is to move the field of participatory design for sustainable smart cities forward by bringing together designers, practitioners, and researchers to explore what it means to co-design genuinely sustainable cities that take into account the ways in which cities and nature, and humans and non-humans are interrelated and interdependent, for the co-creation of environmentally and socially just postanthropocentric cities. We aim to develop new conceptions that move away from traditional binaries and open up new possibilities for thinking about participatory design for urban environments in hybrid digital-physical space. We also aim to explore practical ideas about how more-than-human perspectives can shape actual participatory design practices and policies related to cities. For example, we might explore design responses to new legal rights of non-humans such as trees and rivers [20] and how their participation is negotiated in urban processes in hybrid digitalphysical space [4].
Workshop Topics of Interests

The topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to the following:

 Participatory design and use of smart cities, urban informatics and IoT technologies that explore human/morethan- human relations;
 Methodological approaches, including opportunities and challenges for designing in more-than-human worlds;
 Speculative designs, design fictions, and art projects;
 Ethical and legal considerations, e.g. design responses to a new legal status of nature; • Designs that decentre the human or privilege other species;
 Cultural aspects of sustainable smart cities in this space;

I. PRESENTATIONS
A) Introduction. Why breed conifer trees for improved wood properties?
Prof John MacKay, University of Oxford
The theme of wood properties in tree breeding follows the links between wood properties, timber grading and product recovery in softwoods. Log dimensions, along with external form and defects, and internal properties such as stiffness and specific gravity determine the product type and timber strength. The breeder has a role to play in ensuring that wood properties are favourable for grading and performance of timber. Understanding the opportunities and challenges is the key to setting objectives for the long term.
B)Timber properties and grading for today's market
Prof Daniel Ridley-Ellis, Napier University
This presentation reviewed grading principles and methods applied to softwoods. It showed that there is wide variation in grades within species grown in the UK and small to moderate shifts between species, with larch being an outlier and much higher grades. An overview of different grading approaches included mechanical and acoustic testing, and visual grading. The negative relationship between growth rate and strength was explained. Several considerations were presented pertaining to strength grading; among them, density is not an appropriate predictor of strength, and that strength grading isn't about properties of individual pieces - it's about collective properties of all pieces assigned to a grade.
C)Faster growing trees and timber markets. Considerations for tree breeding.
Dr Paul Mclean, Forest Research
This presentation looked at faster growing trees, primarily genetically improved Sitka. Variation in wood properties depend roughly at equal levels on site effects, inter-tree differences and within tree differences. This is why understanding and optimizing wood properties is complex. British spruce grade is limited by low stiffness, which generally just matches C16 performance, whereas strength and density generally match C20 performance. Stiffness is particularly limiting in the juvenile core, which affects the major cuts of timber as the span the centre of the log (especially in smaller diameter trees). Owing to the relationship between growth rate, site limitations, and juvenile core properties, breeding should aim to improve the juvenile core as a key to obtaining fast growth whilst maintaining a desirable proportion of C16+ timber. The conclusions form this presentation were: 1) Don't ignore stiffness in the core of the tree; 2) Don't ignore the growth dynamics of productive forests; 3) Keep an eye on research; 4) Invest in research. 
D)Engineered wood products: an efficient use of resource
Prof Robert Hairstans
This presentation outlined the wide range of engineered wood products, their attractive performance attributes and their advantages including social, economic and environmental benefits. Some of the advantages of engineered wood products is that they are suitable to facilitate a more circular economy and decrease waste. They performance and design advantages mean that they are able to displace metal and concrete, while at the same time having a lower carbon footprint. At present, most of the European production capacity is located in the central Europe. Engineered wood products an attractive utilisation for British grown softwoods and have the potential change future wood uses and markets. The wood quality requirements for engineered products should be taken into account in future proofing tree breeding strategies. 
E)Breeding conifers for wood properties: goals, opportunities, and challenges
Prof John MacKay, University of Oxford
The presentation outlined the significant potential to genetically improve wood quality traits in softwood trees. This opportunity for improvement is underpinned by relatively high levels of variability within species and high levels of heritability of most wood traits. This is well established and has been shown in diverse species including spruces, pines, among others. The potential for improvement creates an opportunity for alignment of tree breeding objectives with industrial needs. The long-term vision for conifer breeding will need to integrate this opportunity and other needs, while conifer growth rates and tree form have been the main focus to date. New objectives may include increased productivity whilst maintaining wood quality, timber yield and product performance, adaptation to changing climate, resilience to pests. To facilitate the integration of several objectives, an &quot;index selection&quot; approach may be used to assign different weights to traits under selection. As tree breeding addresses this challenge, it will also be faced with knowledge gaps to fill, new technologies to develop and implement, and an even greater need to engage with the forestry sector.
II - ROUND TABLE AND PLENARY DISCUSSIONS 
Four topics were explored; the discussions are summarized below
1. Conifer breeding objectives - What is the long term vision?
There was a consensus that conifer breeding objectives have to align with product manufacture aiming for high value products such as timber of construction grade, that attention to product grading and performance attributes is crucial and should be emphasized. In addition, resilience to both changing climates and pests represents an increasing concern and comes with new challenges. Diversification to broaden the species portfolio and decrease the reliance on Sitka spruce is also seen as desirable but was perceived as constrained by site conditions and threats from pets. 
2. What is the role of wood properties in delivery the vision?
There is a relatively well-understood but complex relationship between timber grading (C16-C24), site constraints and silviculture, tree growth, and wood properties. Increasing yield is a high priority but more rapid tree growth generally increases the juvenile core and the decreases the overall grade of timber. It was agreed that breeding should seek a balance between productivity and wood properties, i.e. increase yields whilst maintaining quality. This means that selection and breeding for wood stiffness should be introduced in species like Sitka spruce. A less strongly held view was to prioritize performance over growth, i.e. aim for C24 and maintain yield, and this may be more easily achieved in other conifers that spruce. Another topic of debate was whether different varieties should be developed for different products, different sites or silviculture regimes. For example, silviculture with or without thinning will produce trees of different sizes and grade potentials. 
3. What are the major knowledge gaps?
The discussions identified many knowledge gaps. How much improvement may be expected in wood properties such as stiffness (Sitka) in the juvenile core? What causes frost cracks and is it under genetic control? What are the limits of tree breeding - e.g. can trees be developed that stop height growth when they reach a critical height on windy sites so as to reduce the risk of wind through? To what extent will climate warming decrease sites that are suitable for Sitka and what can be done to mitigate the impacts of dryer conditions? What is the best approach to remain competitive with C24 timber from Scandinavia and continental Europe?
4. What are the sector engagement needs?
A major need for engagement is with timber processing and marketing about the quality and value of British grown timber and the benefits of tree breeding.

The play-kit consists of blocks of construction materials that are sized to match a cradle-to-gate embodied emission of 100 g greenhouse gas (CO2-eq.). Visitors (families including children) can pick the blocks up and play with them, while research team members are on-site and available to answer visitor questions.

&quot;I am an ecologist studying the responses of tundra ecosystems to climate change. Qikiqtaruk, an island off the north coast of the Yukon Territory in the Canadian Arctic, is a place where these effects are especially tangible. I was lucky enough to conduct two field campaigns there during my PhD with Team Shrub, and to return last summer to shoot a photographic series on environmental change. Like most of the Arctic, the region has experienced rapid warming in the last century, and I will give a brief account of the changes occurring on the island as a result.&quot;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/M016323/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Myers-Smith","Isla H.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Climate as a driver of shrub expansion and tundra greening","30/04/2015","29/04/2018",533956,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M016323/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","D99AA413-09E8-48C9-8432-CDDF8E88A012","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

It has partially fulfilled this role, but also become rather successful as a place for posting relevant job postings, calls for papers and events. The website was revamped with the help of a graphic designer in July 2017, leading to a more streamlined aesthetic and with a logo for consistency and associated twitter account. This account, and the website are also linked to a range of environmental sites, most notably the Royal Anthropological Institute's Environmental Committee Climate Change Hub, which has a remit of sharing curricula, policy-facing tips and so on, and which I have been part of shaping. Another important aspect of the Weather Matters Hub is the Web Roundups, which provide overviews of what is happening around the web, from podcasts to online conferences, from how to write about climate change to exciting new developments in the field, linking to a range of mostly non-paywalled resources and organised in a clearly readable manner (this has been noted in the informal feedback I have received on the site). I have ongoing plans with various people to publish a range of pieces on the site, including conference reviews and other material. The impacts/outcomes are hard to judge in this format, but I have had positive feedback on individual pieces there, and appreciation from those I have emailed to ask whether they'd like me to post the job they are advertising there, as well as finding others aware of pieces on there who did not know about my involvement with the site. Multiple scholars who have just started or are just starting to move into the area of climate change research have been in touch and specifically told me how useful they found the site. My future plans for the site include adjusting it to make it lighter for users who do not have access to high-speed internet (with future grant funding).

Those of us who work on climate change often approach it from very different places, and so interactions in these kinds of venues (such as the 2016 RAI conference at the British Museum) are particularly valuable, and they also provide great access to whole bodies of literature from other disciplines or using other keywords which we may find useful. Attendees included people working between academia and policy, a PhD student, postdoctoral and other scholars (including one who attended via skype). For an outside view see the web link to a review of the workshop by one of the participants. The day was organised with very brief (10-minute) talks by each participant followed by time for discussion. Each participant brought very different experiences and approaches, and engaged with each other's work in very helpful ways. The feedback forms included a lot of enthusiasm for the workshop, as well as suggestions for doing this again, as it had also served an unanticipated pastoral role for a group of scholars who are otherwise rather isolated in our various institutions and settings. I had purposefully kept it national rather than international so as to avoid any flights, which I think worked well, but another time I would spend more time advertising the event, which was hard in this instance because I was in Delhi for the months preceding it, and the Global Environment and Society Academy, with whom I was supposed to be co-organising it had a changeover of staff, meaning they weren't able to be involved.

Although far away from the UK, what is happening in the tundra can be an early warning signal of things to come for the rest of the world. In this talk, Isla Myers-Smith will explore recent evidence for how vegetation in the northern-most areas of our planet is already showing signs of climate change. How are tundra ecosystems changing? Are they becoming greener? How can we use the latest drone technology to understand this change? How does the humble tea bag allow us to understand the tundra carbon cycle? And what will these changes mean for the future of the flora and fauna living in tundra landscapes and for the planet as a whole?

Isla Myers-Smith is global change ecologist. She has been working for over a decade to study how tundra plants and ecosystems are responding to the warming climate.

The report aims to clarify how human rights obligations apply to conservation policies and programmes, how conservation can support human rights, and best practices in avoiding any conflicts between the worthwhile goals of conserving biodiversity and ecosystems, on the one hand, and safeguarding human rights, on the other. The consultation gathered approximately 25 participants, with a wide range of experience and expertise in human rights and/or conservation, including representatives of international institutions and civil society organizations as well as academics.

"EPSRC","EP/M008215/1","Research Grant","Impact Summary","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Social and Political Science","Webb","Janette",NA,NA,"1. The Research and Pathways to Impact 'Reframing Energy Demand' addresses a central problem for energy policy across Europe: decarbonising heat and upgrading the energy efficiency of every building. Our research is based on comparative analysis of policy and practice in real time in Denmark, Germany and UK. The most valuable impacts from our findings are expected to stem from shared lessons for policy makers and practitioners about comparative European policy measures, their rationales and trajectories. As the myriad challenges in decarbonising heat come into sharper focus we are in a strong position to inform and shape debates about the institutional reforms, planning and regulatory frameworks required to move beyond hitherto piecemeal impacts on the energy performance of buildings and marginal changes in the fuels used for heating. In addition, our comparative analysis of the use of economic metrics in guiding policy developments sheds light on the diversity of calculative practices and the consequences of choice of different metrics for the attributed value of low carbon heat and low energy building options. We anticipate that these insights will be increasingly influential as heat decarbonisation progresses from the 'low hanging fruit' to more costly (and hence more contentious) change, at which point the forms of justification used by policy makers will be increasingly subject to scrutiny. Our intended impact has multiple pathways. First we regard policy-makers as our most significant constituents. This is particularly the case for UK and Scottish Government heat and energy efficiency policies, and associated powers and resources afforded to city authorities engaged in policy negotiation, implementation and review. Second the suppliers of low carbon heat systems are expected to benefit from evidence about comparative business structures and investment, and lastly there are benefits for the extensive capacity building networks of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), and the cross-sector Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) and Energy Systems Catapult. The research was designed to engage with each of these sectors and networks as fieldwork progresses and findings emerge. Our research objectives and programme of work were developed from the outset through interaction with policy-makers and practitioners, as well as Co-Directors of the Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (CIED). This has proved effective, already leading to invitations from: UK governments and their advisers to inform policy developments; trade associations to address conferences, convene discussions or act as expert reviewer for industry codes of practice; and energy research centres and industry-facing institutes to present early findings to their cross-sector networks. We have had formal and informal meetings with: Scottish (Innovation and Energy and Climate Change Directorates) and UK Governments (UK Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and Treasury), Scottish Parliament Cross Party Group on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (SPREEE) and Scottish Business; UK local authorities; ETI; Energy Systems Catapult; Energy Savings Trust; Scotland Europa (Brussels); the UK Association for Decentralised Energy (formerly Combined Heat and Power Association); the Danish Board of District Heating, the Danish Energy Agency and Euroheat and Power (Brussels). We expect findings from our comparative analysis of heat and energy efficiency initiatives in Birmingham, Glasgow, Hamburg and Aalborg to support UK city governments in developing and implementing low carbon heat strategies. In the longer term, we expect the research to contribute to new analytic insight into the effectiveness of different policy instruments for innovation in sustainable heat and low energy buildings. 2. Impact Highlights For specific impacts see detailed section Influence on Policy, Practice, Patients and the Public. Highlights are summarised below. Our European comparative analysis has contributed to UK and Scottish Government policies for Local Heat & Energy Efficiency Strategies and District Heating Networks. * At UK level, the research informed the 2017 Government Clean Growth Strategy which set out how the Government intended to meet post-2020 targets, including the agreed Fifth Carbon Budget. This impact stemmed first from Prof Webb's advice to the UK Committee on Climate Change on Heat and Energy Efficiency Policy, which used findings from our comparative research, and second from her work with UK Government BEIS on consumer protection standards for heat network customers. Research findings on the role of UK local authorities in energy systems were also used in development of the successful Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund Wave 2 proposal 'Prospering from the Energy Revolution' (PFER). Prof Webb was invited to join the expert group advising Innovate UK and RCUK on development of the funding proposal. The UK Government Industrial Strategy White Paper 2017 records the successful outcome: 'We will launch a new Industrial Strategy Prospering from the energy revolution programme to develop world-leading local smart energy systems that deliver cheaper and cleaner energy across power, heating and transport, while creating high value jobs and export capabilities' (p.45). PFER received funding of up to &pound;102.5 million for industry and researchers to develop smart integrated local energy systems that can support the global move to renewable energy. Prof Webb continues to be a member of the resulting PFER Advisory Group and Co-Investigator in the associated EnergyRev Research Consortium. * At Scottish level, the distinctive value of our comparative analysis of European district heating (DH) systems, regulated markets and the role of municipal authorities has had particular recognition and is leading to corresponding impact. In relation to Regulation of District Heating (DH), our findings show that a regulatory framework, adapted to the specific energy market and its infrastructures, is a supportive means both to investment and to consumer protection. Presentations of findings to Scottish Government and its advisers (Scottish Futures Trust, Resource Efficient Scotland and Scottish Enterprise) led to the invitation to advise Government on options for regulation of district heating. Ultimately this has had two outcomes. First, proposed statutory powers for local government to develop and implement comprehensive heat and energy efficiency plans for the building stock (Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategies or LHEES); a draft statutory order is expected to proceed to Parliament in 2022. Second, 2021 legislation for DH regulation and licencing, with potential zoning of areas for district heating concessions (https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2021/9/enacted ). * Our comparative European case studies of heat and energy efficiency policy and practice provided a distinctive perspective on heat in buildings, including implications for affordable warmth. This expertise led to: o Appointment of Prof Webb to the Scottish Government Expert Panel to Review the Definition of Fuel Poverty (Bramley, G., Fitzpatrick, S., Liddell, C. and Webb. J. (2017) A New Definition of Fuel Poverty in Scotland - A review of recent evidence Scottish Government ISBN: 978-1-78851-242-8). Report recommendations were integrated into Government fuel poverty strategy, culminating in the Fuel Poverty (Targets, Definition and Strategy) (Scotland) Act 2019. o The 2019 appointment of Prof Webb to the Scottish Government Infrastructure Commission for Scotland, established to provide independent, informed advice on infrastructure vision, ambition and priorities, and to create a 30-year infrastructure strategy to meet Scotland's net zero emission targets, and economic and societal needs. The Commission reported to Government in 2020, with references to our research findings on heat network planning and development https://infrastructurecommission.scot/ . Recommendations to Government were largely accepted and integrated into the Scottish Government Infrastructure Investment Plan 2021-2026 https://www.gov.scot/publications/national-mission-local-impact-infrastructure-investment-plan-scotland-2021-22-2025-26/ . o The invitation from ETI and Energy Systems Catapult to Prof Webb to conduct scoping research on socio-technical aspects of UK local energy planning, as part of learning from the Smart Systems and Heat Programme. The Report fed into: evaluation of the future of Local Area Energy Planning including the role of local authorities https://es.catapult.org.uk/report/the-future-of-local-area-energy-planning-in-the-uk/; and development of a UK platform to support local authority action on net zero ambitions https://es.catapult.org.uk/event/net-zero-go-launch-event/. * By working interactively with both Scottish and UK governments we amplified the impact of our findings on policy development for Local Heat & Energy Efficiency Strategies (LHEES). Our research evidence demonstrates that local government powers to plan clean heat and energy efficiency retrofit programmes are a key factor in improving the coherence of low carbon, low energy buildings and securing investment for new developments. At UK and Scottish level, in current market arrangements, the UK risks stalling on energy efficiency improvements to building stock, and unintentionally promoting an unnecessarily costly patchwork of incompatible heating systems, with limited carbon savings. Returns to private finance from low carbon heat infrastructures are frequently assessed as too low, or too risky, to merit investment, and local governments lack capacity to act systematically on heat and energy efficiency infrastructures at urban scale; hence market development remains fragmented. Evidence about the effectiveness of local heat and energy efficiency planning can however be challenging for UK policymakers, given the continuing political commitment to coordination via markets. We have nevertheless made a significant contribution to policy development in Scotland, where strategy has been informed by our findings through invited contributions to the cross-sector Heat Network Partnership, and Working Groups on district heating regulation. The policy and regulatory developments in Scotland in turn had some influence on policy development within UK Government, through invitations to Prof Webb and Dr Hawkey to advise on heat and energy efficiency policy as detailed in the Influence on Policy Section. o UK adoption of low carbon heat and energy efficiency planning, and district heating regulation, will stimulate major change across the whole energy system. As such there will be extensive consultations and engagement with numerous partners, as well as policy experimentation. The eventual outcome of such processes will not be attributable to any single organisation, research group or specific sector. However, we expect our research to continue to make a significant contribution to policy formation and implementation, with on-going impact. A University of Edinburgh Impact Accelerator Award, for example, enabled development of a 2019 policy briefing on Meeting strategic challenges of UK district heating. * At international level, our findings contributed to capacity building by, for example, o sharing research insights on policy and governance options for sustainable heat. Prof Webb gave plenary addresses at: the UKERC 2016 international workshop on Heat Networks and Governance; University of Hamburg 2017 Making Sustainable Cities - Policies and Practices for Low Carbon Heat in Britain and Germany; Irish Renewable Energy Summit: Heat and Energy Efficiency Policy, 2020 https://www.irishrenewableenergy.energyireland.ie/; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Tenth Annual Seminar on Local and Community Energy, Local Energy in the UK: Social Science Perspectives, 2021 https://www.economiaenergeticauc.cl/. o bringing representatives of the Hamburg government and citizens' initiative (which resulted in re-municipalisation of the energy grids) together with Scottish city authorities at our 2016 Heat Network Partnership workshop, hosted by Falkirk Council. Delegates discussed innovation in low carbon heat in German and Scottish contexts. o presenting evidence at meetings and inquiries organised by European city networks, such as https://heatandthecity.org.uk/project/stratego-project/ .",NA,NA,NA,NA,"56b21373a9eb71.82433881","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=56b21373a9eb71.82433881&grantRef=EP%2FM008215%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M008215/1","57C75CE4-BFCB-4FA6-B729-51D895455218","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","00940FDD-EB46-40A9-A955-EAAA61CC3748",NA,NA,NA,"Energy,Environment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Policy & public services",2018,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/M008215/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Social and Political Science","Research Grant","Webb","Janette",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reframing Energy Demand: Innovation for Sustainable Heat","31/12/2014","31/08/2018",580962,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M008215/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","00940FDD-EB46-40A9-A955-EAAA61CC3748","School of Social and Political Science","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

"BBSRC","BBS/E/D/30002276","Intramural","Impact Summary","University of Edinburgh","The Roslin Institute","Meddle","Simone",NA,NA,"This award provides a platform from which we can attract significant uplift funding. For example expertise supported by this award and the Core Capability Grant to Roslin were key to securing a &pound;74 million HM Government funding investment for data-driven innovation in agriculture as part of the Edinburgh & SE Scotland City Region Deal. This new Agri-Tech hub will involve capital investment in excellent data infrastructure and sequencing capacity. (https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/news-events/latest-news/ps74m-investment-for-agritech-hub-on-campus). Its aim is to improve the efficiency and output of agricultural applications, and enhance worldwide food security by working towards net zero carbon in the Agri-Tech sector, and to inform food and environmental policies. Researchers funded by the programme contribute to our Centre for Tropical Livestock Genetics and Health (CTLGH) to improve the productivity and health of livestock in sub-Saharan Africa by developing and applying the latest genetic and genomics technologies to indigenous breeds, in particular to the benefit of smallholder dairy and poultry farmers. The impact and importance of studying tropical livestock genomes in low and middle-income countries is huge, this is recognised by our awarded Global Challenges Research Fund Impact Acceleration Accounts (GCRF-IAA), and &pound;4 million Department for International Development (DFID) uplift funding. Such awards provide flexible funding to develop strategies to add value to existing BBSRC investments and generate a wide range of outputs, outcomes and impacts in an international development context. CTLGH is a joint venture launched by the Roslin Institute, Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) and CGIAR - International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) with two main nodes, one in Edinburgh and one in Nairobi. This award also promotes extensive knowledge exchange with African researchers, primed by a GCRF-STARS award to train early-career researchers from LMICs at Roslin. Moreover, staff funded by the award have visited ILRI to train laboratory staff, for example in bioinformatics, PGC culture and genome editing strategies. We have developed a chicken genome editing/biobanking pipeline and produced a line of transgenic chickens that are inducibly sterile. We have used these chicken lines as surrogate hosts for genome edited reproductive cells from two other breeds of chicken. Using Sire Dam Surrogate (SDS) mating, we directly produced two breeds of chicken containing edited genes for tropical adaptability as well as developed a high throughput low cost method to biobank chicken. We are currently demonstrating that we can restore chicken flocks using this methodology. The CTLGH has forged close links with the ministries of agriculture in LMIC partner countries to ensure that strategies for achieving genetic gain align with national agricultural development plans. Across ISP3 Theme 2, we work to ensure that genetic gains are not at the expense of animal welfare, with notable advances in mitigating lameness and the impact of negative behaviour. Our on-farm assessment of pig welfare, particularly positive welfare, is an important marker for the monitoring of real welfare impacts of any changes in husbandry systems. We have published a book chapter on Positive Welfare in Pigs: https://www.elsevier.com/books/advances-in-pig-welfare/spinka/978-0-08-101012-9 and a chapter on Sustainable Pig Production: https://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/2017/08/the-meat-crisis. We have also presented our work on pig welfare to public audiences: https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/news-events/latest-news/animal-welfare-on-easter-bush-campus. The exhibition The Pig Park and Other Experiments is now open at the Museum of English Rural Life (MERL) and a newspaper and film related to environmental enrichment for pigs are on show as part of the exhibition: https://merl.reading.ac.uk/event/the-pig-park/ and https://media.ed.ac.uk/media/Carnevale+/0_p0iqoasy. While emphasis is placed on farmed species, ISP-funded work has also refined strategies to enhance the welfare of laboratory rodents, including techniques for handling rats that elicit positive affective states. This was primed by investment of ISP resources to detect ultrasonic vocalisations and recently attracted &pound;341k NC3Rs funding to refine the protocol such that it can be widely applied to benefit the welfare of laboratory rats. Funding from this award has substantially advanced our understanding of the role of microbiomes in health and disease. In particular, our development of tools to assemble whole microbial genomes from rumen metagenome sequence data has transformed our understanding of the microbes present. In turn, these assembled genomes mean that sequence data from microbiome experiments can now be mapped to many more known organisms than before. This is helping us to dissect the basis of greenhouse gas emissions, the mode of action of antibiotic growth promoters and impact of host genetic variation on microbiota, with the longer-term aim of rationally manipulating the microbiome. We are also partnered with a biotechnology company to mine the data for enzymes of industrial value and have developed online resources to share microbiome data: https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3009. KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE AND TRAINING: We have benefitted from an Impact Accelerator Award, Flexible Talent Mobility Awards and Agri-Tech Catalyst funding to catalyse collaboration at the ISP-industry interface and foster innovation and entrepreneurial culture. Full details of our industry engagements and income can be found in our KEC report. We have also provided ISP-linked training in LMICs, e.g. via our GCRF-STARS programme to build capacity for livestock development in Africa and training African Women in Agricultural Research & Development fellows (https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/news-events/latest-news/archive/2019/roslin-support-women-agricultural-ethiopia). ISP participants also contributed to establishment of the African Animal Breeding Network (AABNet; https://www.ctlgh.org/the-african-animal-breeding-network-aabnet/) to bring experts in academia, government agencies and breeding companies together to develop practical breeding solutions. Following the award of Edinburgh & SE Scotland City Region Deal funding, ISP researchers plan to launch new modular and postgraduate training courses in quantitative genetics and breeding and we have hosted TRAIN@Ed Fellows co-funded with Horizon 2020 in this area (https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/job/train-ed). Plans are advanced to launch a new Centre for Aquaculture Genetics & Health in 2022 with City Deal support, building on advances in tools for genotyping of diverse aquatic species from Theme 1 and the application of these to dissect production-relevant traits. As with CTLGH, this Centre will be deeply embedded in ongoing and future ISPs and will benefit from strategically supported expertise and resources. A BBRSC Cross-Institute Workshop was held on The role of livestock in future food production to review the drivers of change in the role of livestock in food production for sustainable agriculture, and define priorities for future research. The outcome of the workshop was a consolidated cross-institute recommendation document that was sent to BBSRC. The workshop also led subsequent invitation of Roslin researchers to panel discussions of the Science Media Centre on Meat Consumption See: https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/news-events/latest-news/archive/2020/future-of-livestock-production-in-the-spotlight. ENGAGEMENT WITH POLICYMAKERS: ISP-funded PIs contributed to consultations on genome editing and the future of farming, including with Defra and via participation in Royal Society, Royal Society of Biology, Regulatory Horizons Council and Nuffield Council working groups. Via AABNet, ISP-funded PIs engage with policymakers in LMICs responsible for national agricultural development plans. We organised a two-day international symposium on 'The future role of livestock in food production' (11th -12th November 2019), attended by 130 delegates including policymakers, for which a report and recommendations were submitted to BBSRC (https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/news-events/latest-news/archive/2020/future-of-livestock-production-in-the-spotlight). We also contribute to the EU Farm Animal Breeding & Reproduction Technology Platform that interfaces with EU policymakers to define research priorities. RESEARCH SUPPORT: This ISP award perpetuates a cadre of highly skilled research technicians at Roslin with skills required to deliver strategic priorities in Agriculture & Food Security that are not readily recruited. PIs and Tenure-Track Fellows in the ISP are supported by a Core Scientist at RA-PDRA level to deliver programme objectives. These individuals typically possess skills that would be difficult to recruit or retain via cycles of short-term responsive-mode funding, and their costs are offset by contributions to external projects at an average of 30%. This ensures that strategically supported resources are available to others in the Research & Innovation ecosystem and positions Roslin as a hub for collaboration, in line with BBSRC's principles for investing in Institutes (https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BBSRC-120721-InstituteStrategy.pdf). We have provided opportunities for Core Scientists to bid for up to &pound;3k to pump-prime research in ISP remit to aid career development. We also provide funding for training, both in discipline-specific skills (e.g. in bioinformatics or accredited training to hold a personal licence for animal research) and via our Institute for Academic Development. POSTGRADUATE TRAINING: Though not directly funded by the ISP, approximately 30 Ph.D. students conduct research that is closely aligned to programme objectives. Many receive training in skills defined by UKRI as vulnerable, including quantitative genetics, computational biology and in vivo skills under the guidance of Core Scientists. They also benefit from models and materials arising from ISP-funded work. All PIs also deliver research-led teaching linked to the ISP, e.g. via our Vet BVM&S and MSc. degrees in Quantitative Genetics & Genome Analysis, Animal Bioscience and Animal Welfare. PIs also contributed to international courses on advanced bioinformatics, quantitative genetics, and strategies for breeding. The ISP award provides a platform to train the next-generation of researchers, with doctoral candidates, M.Res. students, undergraduate honours students and visitors all attracted to work toward programme objectives. Students are provided training in vulnerable skills and capacities identified in a cross-Council review such as: (1) Those required to address global challenges. (2) Sophisticated analysis and interpretation of the complex data generated by genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. (3) Data analytics, especially bioinformatics. (4) Skills to work with whole animals and in vivo work and with a holistic understanding of the physiology of laboratory and farmed animals. (5) Classical neurophysiological methods. (6) Systems biology, particularly the development of integrated optical, electrophysiological, computational, molecular and behavioural approaches to study complex systems in vivo. BENEFITS TO ACADEMIA: 177 non-duplicated publications have been recorded in Researchfish from the start of the ISP to March 2022. Our assembly of thousands of novel microbial genomes from metagenome data, e.g. in the bovine rumen and avian gut, has substantially raised the proportion of sequence reads that can now be mapped to known organisms and can be mined for industrially useful enzymes. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND SCIENCE COMMUNICATION: In 2018, the Easter Bush Science Outreach Centre became the Great Science Share's Edinburgh Satellite and in 2020, the Roslin Institute's Education & Engagement Officer became Regional Champion for Scotland. We offered our local schools our Science @Home Investigation packs (designed for families to use with young learners aged 9-14) and asked them to submit photos and videos of their pupils at home doing the investigations (first lockdown) to be shared on the Great Science Share day in June 2020. Animal behaviour was included as subject material as well as Do yeast need sugar to grow? building on our microbiome and climate change research. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we created an online schools engagement programme Meet a Roslin Scientist. This interactive event gives school pupils and FE college students the unique opportunity to learn about Roslin research and meet with one of our researchers or technical staff to learn about our current research, hear about different career paths and give them the opportunity to ask their own questions. These sessions have involved postdocs, core scientists and technical staff from across the Institute. We have also received acknowledgement of our work from international societies: https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/news-events/latest-news/award-professor-animal-behaviour which has been noted by Scottish Government: http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/28877.aspx?SearchType=AdvanceRferenceNumbers=S5M-07396RsultsPerPage=10 and published in the Veterinary record http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/182/10/275.2.info Factors associated with temperament characteristics: A paper published on genetic and non-genetic factors associated with temperament in dogs was featured on the cover of the journal Heredity and featured in their monthly podcast (https://www.nature.com/hdy/podcast). A Behind the paper article was published on the Nature Research Ecology & Evolution Community blog-site (https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/users/328735-juliane-friedrich/posts/56097-dissecting-genetic-factors-influencing-dog-behaviour). We developed an Animal Behaviour Toolkit - Opening a Can of Worms that won the prestigious annual prize in the public engagement category at the 2020 Understanding Animal Research awards 2020 Openness Awards (understandinganimalresearch.org.uk). The toolkit is a free downloadable resource (http://edin.ac/2zRJJZB) and was created for teachers to support their learners in creating their own science investigations. It has been downloaded over 150 times and is estimated to be used with over 10,000 learners from around the world. It introduces the main concept that the study of animal behaviour is important to help our understanding of what our farmed animals need in order to live comfortable lives. It outlines that the study of animal behaviour in the classroom provides opportunities for teaching pupils about the process of doing science using the scientific method. The toolkit includes a Real-Life Research Fact File and includes information about the use of animals in research and the 3Rs (this section of the toolkit was created in partnership with Understanding Animal Research). Prior to pandemic restrictions, ISP-funded staff supported schools engagement activities via the Easter Bush Science Outreach Centre (https://www.ed.ac.uk/easter-bush-campus/science-outreach-centre), which received >3000 visitors in 103 sessions during 2019 and delivered ISP-linked activities to explain inheritance, DNA and our genetics research. Since March 2020, we have worked closely with schools to supply kits for remote activities, including our Opening a Can of Worms toolkit related to animal behaviour and the ethics of animal research estimated to have been used by over 9,500 students worldwide. This won an award in 2020 from the organisation Understanding Animal Research (https://www.ed.ac.uk/easter-bush-campus/science-outreach-centre/news/schools-project-honoured-with-animal-research-awar), and was publicised in the journal Primary Science (https://www.ase.org.uk/resources/primary-science/issue-1650/opening-can-of-worms). Our Meet a Roslin Scientist and Science@Home videos have so far connected our researchers with 1759 school pupils in 19 local authorities. During 2019, we delivered an ambitious programme of events to celebrate the centenary of animal genetics research in Edinburgh (AG100; https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/engage-with-us/ag100), targeting rural audiences at ten locations across Scotland and the North of England not reached by our previous events. This partly highlighted ISP-funded work linking rumen microbiota to methane emissions and how we use genome-wide association studies to inform selective breeding. We engaged over 30 Edinburgh schools in a new 'Big Balloon Blow Up' activity linked to our methane emission work to coincide with the COP26 climate change conference. In lieu of attendance at public events since March 2020, we have extensively publicised ISP outputs via our website and press releases (https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/news-events). This has benefited from appointment of a PI as the academic liaison for public engagement at 0.2 FTE and formalisation of our strategy for public engagement in research.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5aa1673ed4e194.43120492","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=5aa1673ed4e194.43120492&grantRef=BBS%2FE%2FD%2F30002276","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BBS/E/D/30002276","D92A28B0-AA70-46E3-8CFD-60E4DF99BB87","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","FDA986DE-FF42-437E-B7FF-278A2CE210EC",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Societal,Economic,Policy & public services",2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BBS/E/D/30002276","University of Edinburgh","The Roslin Institute","Intramural","Meddle","Simone",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Complex phenotypes and genotype x environment interactions","31/03/2017","30/03/2020",NA,4575693,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BBS/E/D/30002276","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","FDA986DE-FF42-437E-B7FF-278A2CE210EC","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Science","College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine"

We are now taking forward our dialogues with maize breeders and seed companies about selection for this additional criterion, and jointly developing a pathway for implementation and wider promotion. Our aim here is to develop a strategy for incorporating SOM exploitation into their breeding pipeline.

To deliver this we catalysed the installation and implementation of better-informed land use policy at district, provincial and national levels. We therefore involved multiple stakeholders, incl. government, civil society and private sector actors from the outset of the project. We also involved stakeholders beyond Mozambique, since national policies are highly influenced by international processes. Through the delivery of evidence based policy briefs, meetings, workshops, training and one-to-one targetted interventions, we articulated our evidence of ecosystem service, and well-being impacts of current and proposed policies. Notably on the licensing processes for charcoal production. Those findings led to a direct change in national forest policy - from an increase in supervision for logging processes, to a reduction of licenses granted to large operators. We also developed scenarios detailing the impacts of realistic policy alongside detailed quantitative outputs. Learning and changes in attitudes was reported as a result of this work, which involved sequential, scenario- critiquing workshops from district to national level and the use of communications on scenario outcomes using visual, audio and published media for a range of audiences. Underpinning the scenarios was new knowledge on ecosystem service impacts of major land use changes. Generating this new knowledge involved direct engagements with communities in the study sites who are then be in a position to use these insights to improve the practices over which they have direct control. To influence land use policy beyond their control we drew on the extensive experience of the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), to create impact-effective 'communities of practice' (CoP). Communities of Practice were developed at the District, Provincial. National and International levels.

I also directly presented my research findings to the Zimbabwe Ambassador to Canada and other international stakeholders involved in policy and donor aid work in supporting livelihoods and tackling challenges in small-scale mining communities internationally. Notably, I also helped the Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association in 2018 to develop new strategies for using visual methodologies of community engagement and also new strategies for particularly supporting settlements affected by diamond mining in Eastern Zimbabwe. Moreover, three of my team members have been leading a project to support clean water access in the two main communities where my project is based, in Eastern Zimbabwe, and have particularly used the findings from the research to create a new set of support measures through an Australian Embassy grant. In the aftermath of Cyclone Idai, a devastating climate change-related disaster that struck Chimanimani severely in March 2019, my research in this project helped to inform programmes to establish equitable water access and nutrition gardens to enable people - through piped water systems -to improve health, livelihoods and wellbeing.

It therefore played an important role in raising the competence of UK researchers in theoretical and quantitative approaches. These skills are essential to meet this generation challenges of interpreting big data and biological complexity. ROBuST has generated a powerful suite of modelling tools that help us to resolve complexity, circuit dynamics and characterise the emergent properties of system signalling. We have developed the first digital Arabidopsis, that provides a valuable tool to understand the connectivity between molecular, cellular and whole plant physiology. Resources The ROBuST BioDare data repository (www.biodare.ed.ac.uk) was developed as an open access tool to store, share and analyse timeseries data. BioDare currently stores >20M datapoints from >1200 experiments, providing users with immediate access to wide-ranging data types. On ROBuST, external beta-testing started in 2011, and external users were recruited through a series of UK and International research meetings. A user-protocol paper describing the analysis process was also published (Moore et al., Meth. Mol. Biol. 2014). Partial cost recovery has commenced, with ten years of service purchased in the first year. Data analysis software, developed, or reconfigured on ROBuST e.g. Spectrum Resampling or FFT-NLLS are accessible through BioDare, or through the Warwick Systems Biology Centre http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/systemsbiology/research/software/. The extensive, 176 line, ROBuST p:LUC collection is available through the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC). In-house developments The extensive modelling capabilities and experience gained on ROBuST led to the establishment of Edinburgh Plant Science (EPS), a new network (led by Halliday) that assembles over 600 plant scientists and social scientists (from 7 Universities/Institutes).

Emerging: Through this network, communication between disciplines has evolved extremely rapidly. Notable features are the crossover between social sciences, of public and institutional perception, into evidence flowing from work on power plant engineering and development of existing and innovative carbon capture technologies, through to understanding safety and security of pipeline transportation on land, and the operationalisation, safety, and resilience of deep geological storage in porous sediments beneath the North Sea. Partly through this work, the UK is the most intense CCS nation in the world, with over 17 commercial CCS projects having been proposed, and 6 having been taken to engineering design stages at multi-million pound spending. Public private third NGO sectors: CCS is a new technology group. It is frequently viewed with suspicion by the general public, and especially by NGO and environmental charities. A key role of this network has been the ability to engage directly with communities and with individuals affected or concerned or stakeholders in CCS. This has resulted in trusted dialogue, so that the UK is one of only two nations in Europe where CCS developments can be welcomed by the general public, understood by investors, and appreciated by industry. Challenges: most difficulty has been experienced with the erratic course of public and political policy, linked to the difficulty of first and innovative large industrial developments. Most unusually, the research undertaken within this network is directly affected by real-world issues such as: Treasury budgets election cycles, or climate change agreements. Current difficulties relate to the slower than expected progress of commercial CCS projects, such that commercial industries business and investors have not perceived that a steady cin of projects is guaranteed in the short term. Consequently it is proving difficult to maintain a large number of industry and business contacts, because many commercial actors are choosing to scale down their CCS activity, until more commercial projects are available. This has not halted the progress of high quality research, which has already delivered significant impacts, and is still showing promise of producing further innovation in cost reduction and efficiency and improvement of confidence during the next 5 to 15 years.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"54629d633583f2.88404496","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=54629d633583f2.88404496&grantRef=EP%2FH022961%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/H022961/1","E157E18D-772B-4B4B-A524-D47B19665F7D","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","8806A5B5-54A8-4315-916C-3559E79417C2",NA,NA,NA,"Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Chemicals,Construction,Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Societal,Economic",2009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/H022961/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Haszeldine","Stuart",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UK Carbon Capture and Storage Community Network (UKCCSC)","01/11/2009","31/10/2013",252338,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/H022961/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","8806A5B5-54A8-4315-916C-3559E79417C2","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

We expect to generate seven figure premium income in this growing market in the first year, said Phil Cottle, Managing Director of ForestRe Limited. [a] As a result of Edinburgh's pest and disease risk modelling, ForestRe is currently investigating the development of a pest and disease risk product to fill a much needed void in the sector. The potential market for such a product probably runs in to hundreds of millions of dollars, said Cottle. Our ability to service that market with a product that draws on leading-edge science, which is attractive to forestry owners, and profitable for us is due, in no small part, to working with the Edinburgh team to harness the outputs of NERC-funded research. [a] Pest and disease risk management model informs forestry management policy and practice The Forestry Commission has also been partners in the NERC funded projects led by Edinburgh. The collaborations have led to an effective exchange of knowledge that has enabled the Forestry Commission to incorporate the research findings, which have practical implications and economic benefits, into their business practices. An example of this is how insights into pest and disease risk is influencing management practices and processes. This project is enhancing our understanding of risk, said Dr Pat Snowdon, Head of economics and climate change at the Forestry Commission. Woodlands in the UK face a growing number of risks from pest and disease threats. Assessing these is essential in enabling us to develop resilient woodlands for the future and in underpinning important policy initiatives such as the Woodland Carbon Code. [b] These changes in management practices will take years to implement and the economic benefits resulting from reduced losses in forestry stock, will accrue over decades. There are enormous economic losses that are likely to be avoided as a result of implementing these insights, said Snowdon [c]. Forestry projects that comply with the Woodland Carbon Code attract carbon sequestration credits, which can then be traded, making them an attractive investment proposition. The Edinburgh researchers, notably Susan Davies the project's research Associate, have provided a robust method for assessing how much carbon sequestration capacity is at risk of being lost to pest and disease, which reduces uncertainty for potential investors. The relationships built through the projects have led to new collaborations, including: a new collaboration between the University of Edinburgh (Dr Simon Mudd), NERC British Geological Survey (Dr MD Hurst and Dr C Foster, Co-Investigators) and industry partners, which recently won funding under the NERC Environmental Risks to Infrastructure Call.

"EPSRC","EP/K037404/1","Research Grant","Impact Summary","University of Edinburgh","Edinburgh College of Art","Ward Thompson","Catharine",NA,NA,"By 2050, 89% of the UK's population will live in cities and 24% will be aged over 65. This is the basis on which, in early 2016, the Parliamentary Office of Science & Technology (POST) decided that UK parliamentarians urgently required briefing on creating age-friendly cities. Having read the first academic outputs from Mobility, Mood and Place (MMP), POST contacted the research team to ask for assistance with reviewing the scope of its work. Over the next six months, continued liaison led to the researchers identifying themes for inclusion, peer reviewing drafts and, finally, to MMP (and earlier research by the team) being cited in POSTnote 539 published in October 2016. During the development phase of POSTnote 539, MMP researchers made two key recommendations, the first being that the Note should highlight the importance of urban greenspace for people's health and wellbeing. In the published Note, there is a whole section given over to greenspace and its association with multiple health benefits. With MMP researchers' involvement, this aspect of age-friendly urban placemaking has also been gaining traction in international policy arenas, with the World Health Organization (WHO) leading the way. For example, in November 2015 - on the basis of her invaluable contribution to our work on green space and health - MMP PI, Professor Ward Thompson, was invited to speak on the subject at a WHO European Environment and Health Task Force (EHTF) meeting in Skopje, Macedonia. The meeting was deemed to be of particular strategic importance to the subsequent Ministerial Conference and Declaration on Environment and Health, signed in Ostrava, Czech Republic, in June 2017. Among other objectives, this committed Member States to supporting the efforts of European cities and regions to become healthier and more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable through an integrated, smart and health-promoting approach to urban and spatial planning. Other outputs arising from the Macedonia meeting include a WHO European Region report on 'Urban Green Space and Health' (Copenhagen, 2016) citing research papers from our work, particularly as it relates to mobile EEG measures of neural activity. Partnered by the Covenant on Demographic Change as part of an Impact Acceleration Award, MMP has also been working with European cities and regions on age-friendly policies and strategies, most notably the City of Utrecht, convenors of the Health at the Heart of the Urban Development Strategy discussion during the European Week of Regions and Cities 2017 (with Professor Ward Thompson as a panellist, alongside peers from Utrecht, M&eacute;tropole de Lyon, the WHO and DG Sant&eacute;). In February 2018, following a gathering of 43 mayors and 85 high-level political representatives in Copenhagen on the same topic, Deputy Mayor Victor Everhardt of Utrecht (a panellist at the Brussels event), announced the creation of a new WHO Europe Healthy Cities Network working group on environment and health. The second key recommendation made by the MMP team to POSTnote 539 is reflected in its headline point on the lack of robust evidence about the effectiveness of proposed interventions. This is a theme carried over from evidence given by Professor Ward Thompson to the House of Lords Design Commission Inquiry on Built Environment and Behaviour (Neighbourhoods and Housing) in November 2015. The Commission's invitation to give evidence in person was made on the quality of MMP's earlier written response to the Call for Evidence which cited, among other outputs, the team's journal paper on the home as an enabler of active lifestyles (Dr Brookfield as lead author). In January 2017, over seventy guests from industry, policy and the not-for-profit sector joined the researchers for an exhibition and reception at the House of Lords at which Baroness Greengross talked about the importance of the project. To effect the step-changes in age-friendly placemaking envisioned in policy, industry requires guidance on appropriate methods and techniques. Since late 2015, MMP has been working with the Centre for Accessible Environments (CAE) to promote co-design as an effective way of involving end users in the design process. Having contributed to the development of The A-Z of Co-Design, MMP's practical guide to the participatory design process, CAE included the publication as a centre pull-out within Access by Design, a journal distributed to 700 industry subscribers. Writing in the foreword to the A-Z, the Centre's Director, Jean Hewitt, describes it as nothing short of inspirational, a catalyst to fresh thinking, and an engaging tool which will help us all to use participatory design as the norm. Originally published as a folding wallchart, the A-Z was reprinted in English, Spanish and French as a desktop calendar for 2018. Through partners, including the Design for All Foundation and the Covenant on Demographic Change, 500 copies were distributed to professionals, local and national government, and third sector organisations throughout Europe and Francophone Canada, leading to multiple new/renewed connections, including with the Laboratory for Inclusive Mobility (France) and the Francophone Network of Age-Friendly Cities and Communities. In February 2017, MMP entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with CAE to develop a professional training course based on the A-Z, with the first session delivered in June 2017 to participants from a range of disciplines, including planners, urban designers and strategists from the Royal Borough of Kingston, Future for London, Royal Town Planning Institute and Urban Design London. Comments on the usefulness of the training included I'm running a project on Ageing London - Housing and Connectivity so I will use the research design recommendations and I'll definitely use some of the literature. In addition to the A-Z, key non-academic outputs from MMP include a three minute animation on findings and recommendations, an illustrated, 32-page guide to co-designing age-friendly environments, and a touring exhibition. Promoted through social media, the animation has been widely admired and shared, with comments including a great animation and a very important message (Age Scotland), and excellent video about developing places to support healthy ageing (Greenspace Scotland). Diarmaid Lawlor, Head of Urbanism at Architecture and Design Scotland (A&DS), has called MMP a hugely important project giving older people a voice in making urban and rural environments better places for lifelong living and the exhibition in particular an opportunity to bring world class thinking and engagement in touch with local initiatives to inform debate and influence stakeholder thinking. Having promoted the exhibition in three Scottish venues as part of its nationwide Say Hello to Architecture programme, the Festival of Architecture, and Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design 2016, A&DS also promoted and hosted the launch of the 32 page guide to co-design in November 2017, leading to ongoing engagement with Moray Council on a project to better align land use planning with healthcare objectives, the council having already incorporated aspects of MMP into its new draft policy on placemaking.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"56c330aa52d065.89887570","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=56c330aa52d065.89887570&grantRef=EP%2FK037404%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K037404/1","17B5E480-CC10-417E-9532-7A5136A048F1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","3E3E42C4-8B36-476B-8DA0-48AEC4DDEFC8",NA,NA,NA,"Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Societal,Policy & public services",2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/K037404/1","University of Edinburgh","Edinburgh College of Art","Research Grant","Ward Thompson","Catharine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mobility, Mood and Place: a user-centred approach to design of built environments to make mobility easy, enjoyable and meaningful for older people","31/08/2013","29/04/2017",1273656,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K037404/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","3E3E42C4-8B36-476B-8DA0-48AEC4DDEFC8","Edinburgh College of Art","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

Off Grid Solar Scorecard: In 2015 in collaboration with SVTC and the Turing Trust, a UK Charity, Cross launched the Off Grid Solar Scorecard, an initiative that introduced new international standards for reparability and sustainable design into the off grid solar industry. The Off Grid Solar Scorecard is an online tool that allows people to evaluate the sustainable design of pico-solar products sold in Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia by disassembling them. The solar score card evaluates the capacity of solar lanterns to be locally repaired. The score card system is designed to (i) extend the lifespan of solar lanterns in hard-to-reach locations (ii) encourage manufacturers to build repair options into their design (iii) reduce solar waste. The tool is the result of consultation with stakeholders across the off grid solar lighting industry and had been endorsed by distributors of solar lighting products in Africa and Asia. 2. In March 2014, in partnership with Scene, an Edinburgh based renewable energy consultancy and India's Energy and Resources Institute, Cross was awarded &pound;60k by the Scottish Government to launch 'Urjaa Samadhan', an SMS based solar repair system for rural Odisha, India. This grant was a practical recognition of the importance of Cross's ESRC funded research into the issues of technological breakdown and failure in off grid solar markets that impede efforts to extend energy access. Urjaa Samadhan has sought to translate qualitative research on solar energy technologies and market failure into a viable non-profit social enterprise capable of both generating livelihood opportunities in the informal repair economy and significantly extending the lifetime of solar photovoltaic systems. In 2015 Urjaa Samadhan was runner up 'Social Impact Technology of the Year in the annual Business Green Technology Awards. In 2016 six solar power distribution and installation companies in Odisha began using Urjaa Samadhan's suite of SMS and web based tools to extend their repair and maintenance networks. 3. In 2015 in partnership with the Knoydart Foundation, Cross launched the UK's first 'renewable energy data light bulb' that connected a lightbulb to a live feed of community electricity data and presented an innovative alternative way of managing energy demand. The lightbulb responded to the ESRC Off the Grid project findings, which identified the ways that 'smart' or digital devices, information systems and logics are changing relationships to technical systems and reshaping the conditions of possibility with which people encounter electricity off the grid. The installation in Knoydart - preliminary and provisional - offered a unique starting point for people and organisations interested in linking the future of lighting design to our low carbon future and was profiled by the Scottish Mail, the Telegraph, and the Times, by Philips and the BBC (Landward 6th June 2016). Art practice related impact: 1. We worked closely with Scottish based artists to develop new methods for incorporating ethnographic methods into art practice and ethnographic findings into artistic outputs. This led directly to two artists generating new bodies of anthropology/ethnography informed work. One of those bodies of work was subsequently displayed in a solo exhibition in Edinburgh and a display at Somerset House in London. These impacts were achieved through (i) a three day micro-residency held with 10 artists, illustrators and designers to develop artworks out of the findings from our ESRC supported research (ii) a collaboration with an illustrator to develop new ways of 'telling stories' with our findings (iii) an ethnographer/artist residency on the Isle of Eigg to explore the meanings of being 'off grid' through mapping and way finding.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"56d991658ff6f7.22497954","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=56d991658ff6f7.22497954&grantRef=ES%2FL003147%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/L003147/1","AB900466-A4C9-4876-80A4-C1DB59BBC163","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","FD6E1F77-6815-4865-843C-79065810045F",NA,NA,NA,"Energy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cultural,Policy & public services",2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ESRC","ES/L003147/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Social and Political Science","Research Grant","Street","Alice","Naomi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Off the Grid: Relational Infrastructures for Fragile Futures","31/08/2013","30/08/2015",200134,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/L003147/1","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","FD6E1F77-6815-4865-843C-79065810045F","School of Social and Political Science","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

AGD is one of the most serious threats to the sustainable production of farmed salmon. The impact on UK salmon production includes reduced growth, substantial treatment and management costs, increased susceptibility to other pathogens and potentially mortality. We worked with salmon breeding company Landcatch (part of Hendrix Genetics) to identify regions of the genome that impact resistance to salmon. A novel finding was a QTL on Chromosome 18 that explained a significant proportion of the genetic variation in resistance. We then tested novel methods of implementing genomic selection to improved resistance via selective breeding; results which have been published recently (Robledo et al. 2018, G3) and also implemented in the industry to help tackle this serious problem for salmon production (https://www.hendrix-genetics.com/en/news/improving-breeding-combat-amoebic-gill-disease-salmon/). These results have led to new methods of tackling a long term disease problem in aquaculture, and the methods used are likely to be utilized to tackle other important diseases, potentially in other aquaculture species.

"NERC","NE/S009000/1","Research Grant","Impact Summary","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","McCloskey","John",NA,NA,"Globally, more than two billion people living in DAC cities are exposed to multiple natural hazards, which threaten the cyclical destruction of their lives and livelihoods. The first step in transitioning from crisis management to multi-hazard risk-informed, inclusive planning is the development of partnerships and enabling conditions (including capacity development and access to data) for the implementation of people-centric risk-informed planning methods, including the Tomorrow's Cities Decision Support Environment (TCDSE). This has been the focus of our work to date, in cities, and with key international organisations. Kathmandu, capital of a least-developed country, with a steadily increasing population, is susceptible to strong earthquakes, severe flooding and frequent landslides. New Town Developments (NTDPs) are planned around the ancient traditional settlements of Khokana and Bangamati (NTDP-Lalitpur), and require a risk- sensitive Land-Use Plan (LUP), which is inclusive of all stakeholder views (community, Ward Authority, municipality, Government). Following the release of the TCDSE, the Ministry for Urban Development (MoUD) requested TCDSE implementation to support urban planning of NTDP-Lalitpur. This is now underway. Future visioning workshops have been undertaken individually with four groups of the Khokana community, leading to the development of a LUP, from the perspective of the collective community, to be considered alongside the plans of the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority. This LUP was presented back to the community in March '22 for further discussion. This iterative process enables the democratisation of how risk is defined so that risk assessments better reflect the lived experience of different stakeholder groups. Plans are being codified for use in risk modelling to assess the agreed, multi-hazard risk associated with each plan and ultimately ensure that plans going to construction are inherently lower risk. The Secretary to the MoUD as well as the Director General of the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction will travel to Edinburgh on 28th March to discuss the role out of the process in up to six other Nepalese cities where the TCDSE might be applied to ongoing planning developments. In Nairobi, 2.5million people live in informal settlements ('slums') such as Mukuru and Kibera, where fire and floods pose a daily threat to residents. Challenges of capacity (knowledge, resource, data) and disconnections between different departments and with community-facing organisations means risk is rarely integrated into urban planning. The Hub and NCCG (under an MoU), have co-convened, fortnightly, multi-sector Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) policy dialogues on risk-informed planning and management. These dialogues have contributed to several changes in NCCG, including 10 staff pursuing further studies in disaster risk management and the deployment of 60 new staff to departments of disaster management. Dialogues have raised the urgent need to share data across departments and to develop a common dataset for risk management. A meeting in December '21, with representatives from NCCG departments and researchers, has initiated a special cross-departmental group to facilitate data sharing and the linkage of datasets which will see a paradigm shift in NCCG's ability to integrate risk in planning and decision making using the TCDSE, and ultimately reduce risk for millions of slum residents. Understanding the social construction of risk and multiple hazards in Quito is central to planning for reduced risk. Working with Museums of Quito, the team built a series of risk and hazard exhibitions which reached over 600 visitors, and now feature as produced permanent museum features. The team developed a digital educational platform about urban planning and risk reduction, which is being used in 20 municipal schools. Courses have been held with 40 teachers on the use of the platform, which the Ministry of Education has validated. Following a fatal landslide in February 2022, Quito's Mayor engaged the Hub directly, and plans are underway to collaborate with the Hub's City Labs (which convene practitioners and policy-makers across Quito) towards a common goal of reducing disaster risk at the planning stage for new developments in Quito, through deployment of the TCDSE. At an international level, Hub findings have been incorporated into the IPCC 6th Assessment Review Working Group 2: Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability (Chapter 6). The Hub has been invited to host a booth and a side-event at the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction: UNDRR's leading global forum to assess and discuss progress implementing the Sendai Framework. The Hub competed against 250 applications to secure one of the 24 available side events, with UNDRR commending our thorough and high-quality submission.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5e68fdf900af59.09589878","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=5e68fdf900af59.09589878&grantRef=NE%2FS009000%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/S009000/1","CAEBEC0F-B2DC-4634-A845-0326F1D4B103","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","F2242228-2720-4375-998D-0AE1F4F388C3",NA,NA,NA,"Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cultural,Societal",2021,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/S009000/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","McCloskey","John",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"GCRF Urban Disaster Risk Hub","13/02/2019","11/05/2024",17657278,NA,"Scotland","Active","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/S009000/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","F2242228-2720-4375-998D-0AE1F4F388C3","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the UK and stroke-associated infection (SAI) is a major complication of strokes and affects up to one third of patients and is associated with greater incidence of death and disability with no effective treatments. Experimental stroke models in mice has allowed us to identify impaired function of B cells in the spleen. This has led to ongoing collaborations with the University of Manchester and has resulted in the award of &pound;1.3 million in funding from the MRC in order to explore this area of research further. In terms of patient care, these studies have implicated markers which could have potential utility in identifying stroke patients at particularly high risk of infection and allowing preventative or therapeutic measures to be put in place. Animal welfare whether farmed livestock or experimental animals is an ongoing concern in terms of quality of life and also the impact that it can have on food security. Animal welfare research in this programme has led to practical outcomes with the publishing of the IMPROVE guidelines which relate to experimental stroke research. Researchers have been involved with NC3R working groups and have produced a set of 43 recommendations for best practice in rodent models. Not only minimising animal suffering but also reducing variability in studies and improving reproducibility and allowing fewer animals to be used overall. In terms of livestock, pigs are most often farmed under intensive conditions and welfare is of the utmost concern. We have made significant advances in understanding the effect of stress on maternal behaviour which can impact on piglet survival and the advantages of environmental enrichment on promoting good health. These findings have the potential to lead to increased farm animal welfare and in turn, better food quality.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"545a04d59e8124.72138099","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=545a04d59e8124.72138099&grantRef=BBS%2FE%2FD%2F20251969","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BBS/E/D/20251969","42B40526-7A22-4A7B-BD19-45C21D32E9B9","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","8C461B7D-12CA-49CE-8D96-46F91D095EAE",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Policy & public services",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BBS/E/D/20251969","University of Edinburgh","The Roslin Institute","Intramural","Gill","Andrew","Christopher","http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5201-9473",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Identifying mechanisms regulating central nervous system homeostasis","31/03/2012","30/03/2017",NA,2444582,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BBS/E/D/20251969","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","8C461B7D-12CA-49CE-8D96-46F91D095EAE","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Science","College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine"

"EPSRC","EP/K000446/1","Research Grant","Impact Summary","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Gibbins","Jonathan",NA,NA,"The UK CCS Research Centre (UKCCSRC) is a virtual hub that brings together leading UK CCS researchers, acting as an interface for government, industry and international collaboration. It develops, coordinates and leads a programme of underpinning research that covers all aspects of CCS to deliver basic knowledge and understanding and support UK government efforts on energy and climate change. The UKCCSRC provides a national focal point for CCS R&D to analyse problems, devise and carry out world-leading research and share delivery. We help build the UK economy by driving an integrated research and impact delivery programme focused on maximising the contribution of CCS to a low- carbon energy system for the UK. The build-up of CCS in the UK needs to be supported by close links, in both directions, between underpinning research teams in all areas and the CCS practitioners undertaking demonstration and deployment. The UKCCSRC has a key role here through its Research and Pathways to Impact Development (RAPID) process and its Research Group activities linked to partner organisations in the UK and overseas and a wide range of stakeholders. The UKCCSRC provides CCS researchers with the infrastructure, support and opportunities to foster creativity and to deliver the highest quality long-term research on CCS in areas where there is current or future national need. Our multidisciplinary research enhances national capacity and act as focal point for international engagement. The need for a UK CCS-based decarbonisation option remains strong, as evidenced by both the Committee on Climate Change and the Energy Technologies Institute. Withdrawal of capital funding for the Commercialisation Competition made UK Government strategy less clear, in response to which the UKCCSRC co-ordinated development work with domestic, European, and global stakeholders, to ensure continuity until the Government's revised strategy was launched in late 2017. The UKCCSRC, through its role in the EERA CCS Joint Implementation Programme, is well-placed to help shape the European research and policy agenda to support these developments. Links are also in place with other leading CCS countries to allow project experience and research efforts to be shared and coordinated. The UKCCSRC brings together visionary leaders who will set national and international multi- discipline and medium-timescale research agendas that combine the range of intersecting fields of knowledge that are required to maximise the potential of CCS. The UKCCSRC provides new leadership opportunities with the delivery of complex, long-term research programmes, and provide leadership and development opportunities for early- and mid-career researchers. Call 1 and Call 2 projects, funded through the Centre's flexible research programme, have and are delivering a wide range of impactful outputs (see later in the submission).",NA,NA,NA,NA,"54627ed3a74082.36939078","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=54627ed3a74082.36939078&grantRef=EP%2FK000446%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","DAD8D8F7-42C8-4BDC-8AFA-1F77CC7433B2","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4",NA,NA,NA,"Energy,Environment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Societal,Economic",2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/K000446/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Research Grant","Gibbins","Jonathan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UKCCSRC - The United Kingdom Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre","31/03/2012","31/12/2015",10127951,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4","School of Engineering","College of Science and Engineering"

The outputs from this project have included estimation of genetic parameters for resistance to sea lice and salmon rickettsial syndrome in AquaInnovo's breeding populations. These two diseases are currently the most problematic in Chile from an economic, environmental and animal welfare perspective. We have also located and characterized individual genes with functional association with resistance. Finally, we have tested new methods of genomic selection, including use of genotype imputation to reduce costs, and testing of new statistical models. These results are being applied within the breeding programmes of AquaInnovo, and will be disseminated for uptake by other aquaculture breeding companies. This will include extensive use of the techniques developed by breeding companies producing aquatic species farmed in DAC list countries, including tilapia and shrimp. The translation of selective breeding innovations from salmon to these less-developed sectors has historically happened quite quickly, and we expect this will be the case here. Improvement of disease resistance in aquaculture species will help develop aquaculture as an important source of high quality protein and energy for developing country populations. The outputs of this project were recognised by the shortlisting of the project for the prestigious Newton Prize, which seeks to highlight innovation and impact in Newton partner countries. https://www.benchmarkplc.com/news/sea-lice-and-srs-research-shortlisted-for-the-newton-prize/",NA,NA,NA,NA,"58bed81b016849.70710520","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=58bed81b016849.70710520&grantRef=BB%2FN024044%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/N024044/1","794821F3-2C2B-4810-8174-D15FA52B7DDE","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","AEF3FD20-9B6A-4C56-B01F-2E70CCB9ABC5",NA,NA,NA,"Agriculture, Food and Drink",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cultural,Societal,Economic",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BB/N024044/1","University of Edinburgh","The Roslin Institute","Research Grant","Houston","Ross",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RCUK-CONICYT: Utilising functional genomic variation for improved disease resistance in Chilean salmon aquaculture","01/02/2016","30/11/2018",339925,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/N024044/1","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","AEF3FD20-9B6A-4C56-B01F-2E70CCB9ABC5","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Science","College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine"

"EPSRC","EP/N021487/1","Research Grant","Impact Summary","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Venugopal","Vengatesan",NA,NA,"Background Information: From April 2016, multiple meetings were held with a leading UK TEC developer, ScotRenewables, SR, (Now renamed to Orbital Marine Power), both at their premises and here within the School of Engineering. These meetings were of broad scope and in addition to standard steering group engagements. These meetings uncovered an important Industrial requirement for a robust investigation of a particular turbulence metric, namely Turbulence Intensity (TI). Whilst TI is the simplest of turbulence metrics that can be inferred from field measurements the derived values vary significantly depending on post-processing method and moreover across the presence and absence of ocean waves. This uncertainty in the real value of TI for a given site affects component selection and ultimately levelized cost of energy. Activities: In parallel to existing FloWTurb activities research staff provided SR with an interim report focusing on TI as derived from advanced re-analysis of UEDIN-held field data acquired during the ReDAPT Project (ETI). Our findings matched those of our industrial partner: that more work was needed to quantify the level of turbulence and the level of uncertainty. Given the industrial need (SR are in the process of procuring components for their next machine and purchase decisions are based on component fatigue estimates stemming from TI values) the research team continued this work and produced a journal paper that has recently been accepted. Findings and Impact: It was found that the specification of the region of the water column of interest along with the type of post-processing conducted on the raw measurement data strongly affected the resulting turbulence values. This work is titled: Characterisation of tidal flows at the European Marine Energy Centre in the absence of ocean waves and will be published in the ENERGIES Special Edition on Marine Energy. It has been shared with SR and we will continue to update the work e.g., to allow extrapolation of the findings to other industrially-relevant sites. SR have agreed to keep us informed of where they make use of this detailed information to let us track impact. Our findings reveal that the company's previous estimates of TI were too high. They can now use this information in their purchasing decisions for major or critical components in their next generation machine. Ongoing: We continue to collaborate with SR on new avenues - such as investigations on coherent turbulent structures and complex wave-current interactions. This collaboration has led to a new parallel activity: a research student within our team has been granted access to SR's commercial engineering software on a part-time basis. SR has also expressed their support to provide blade loading data which would be used in validating the software tool being developed in FloWTurb for fatigue loading calculations. Duration 2017 onwards : Background information: In 2017 Meygen Simec Atlantis has completed the installation and commissioning phase of four 1.5 MW tidal turbines in the Inner Sound, Pentland Firth. As part of the commissioning process and commercial handover the actual turbine output had to be monitored against the incoming flow velocities across the water column. To facilitate this Power Curve Testing (PCT) process in line with the relevant IEC standard, high resolution flow data from close upstream of the turbines was required. Activities: In collaboration between the FloWTurb project partner University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI), local marine services company Hebrides Marine Services Ltd, and Meygen Simec Atlantis, an agreement was reached how to gather the required datasets to support MeyGen's requirements, but at the same time to make the data available to the FloWTurb project for turbulence assessment, model calibration and validation. The data gathering activities were funded by MeyGen, but implemented and supported with equipment from the UHI in support of the FloWTurb project. Findings and impact: A number of quality ADCP datasets at 2 Hz sample rate and 1 m bin sizes were gathered from a real tidal energy development. These datasets have enabled MeyGen to complete the PCT, but have also led to further collaborative work between MeyGen and the UHI. Based on the datasets a paper was presented at the AWTEC conference in 2018, and another paper on turbulence assessment at the site is currently in the review process at 'Renewable Energy'. The analysis of the data has given a detailed insight into the spatial and time domain based distributions of key turbulence features at the site, including Turbulence Intensity, Turbulence Kinetic Energy, and Turbulence Length Scales. These findings are relevant to the research community to enhance the understanding of turbulence related force fluctuations and stresses at a tidal site. But these findings are also highly relevant the MeyGen to review and inform the control system process, and improve the understanding of fatigue loadings, etc. at the turbine blades. Ongoing: The current data analysis has now been completed. There are some ambitions to build on the existing relationship with the world leading tidal energy developer, and the implementation of these is subject to securing further funding.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"58c81057c396d4.11048309","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=58c81057c396d4.11048309&grantRef=EP%2FN021487%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N021487/1","E394CB86-632F-4E1E-9D78-D684370E1793","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","02F929E9-8466-49E0-8B7D-54F0FB0C9A9F",NA,NA,NA,"Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Education,Energy,Environment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Economic,Policy & public services",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/N021487/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Research Grant","Venugopal","Vengatesan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"FloWTurb: Response of Tidal Energy Converters to Combined Tidal Flow, Waves, and Turbulence","12/04/2016","31/10/2019",745542,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N021487/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","02F929E9-8466-49E0-8B7D-54F0FB0C9A9F","School of Engineering","College of Science and Engineering"

We translate our understanding of the fundamental physics that governs how components (such as colloids, polymers, liquid crystals etc.) interact with one another in complex fluids, to advance industrial formulations. By applying the design principles of soft matter physics to formulations, ECFP is able to help companies understand their formulations and guide them towards solutions to the challenges they face. Furthermore, a more complete understanding of the generic principles underlying formulation behaviour can lead to innovation, e.g. through new process methods or reduction in the number of ingredients. The themes of Formulation Science, Microorganisms Interacting with Complex Structures, Advanced Soft Materials and Instrument Development have all emerged as areas of strength where we use our expertise to support industry. ECFP endeavours to improve product performance, the consumer experience and help companies switch to more sustainable resources and more efficient processes.

The simulation of air capture indicated that the materials currently available were better suited to capture from more CO2 rich sources such as the emission from gas-fired power stations.

This has been achieved by establishing promising governmental and community partnerships, since it began in January 2020 (it is due to finish in January 2024). SIPP works with academic and community partners in 4 ODA countries: Brazil, Eswatini, Palestine and South Africa. Societal and economic impact of the award on the DAC list countries The SIPP project to date has directly encouraged Early Childhood Education (ECE) development within its community case studies, with societal impacts. These indirectly have economic impacts, in fostering parents' and particularly women's ability to take on paid employment and providing paid employment opportunities within ECE. The project's focus on safe, inclusive participative pedagogies has specifically had impact on ECE practice and family relationships within the focus communities. Further, partner country teams are currently influencing policy and service development at local and in some cases national levels, with societal impact. As further detailed in the common question set, all partner countries have developed partnerships with local organisations and stakeholders within their case study community in order to ensure effectiveness and sustainability. * In South Africa, a strong partnership with a third sector organisation, True North, has resulted in an active community advisory group. Already this group has fostered new and stronger interagency connections, benefitting ECE provision, and child well-being more broadly. * The University of Eswatini is working closely with National Children Services Department (the Eswatini Government's coordinating agency for children's issues), the SOS Children's Villages Eswatini and Alliance of Mayors Initiative on Community Action on AIDS at The Local Level, to undertake their community fieldwork and make connections between data being collected from different sources. * Bethlehem University has built strong relationships with three communities. In Masarah village, a partnership between the research team and community members has resulted in the establishment of an ongoing childcare setting within a local centre, managed by the community and with children supported to take active roles in decision-making and implementation (December 2020 onwards). In 2021, two new partnerships have been established with Thabra village, with a campaign to rehabilitate a caravan for parent-child activities, and the Aida Refugee Camp where, in addition to research activities, workshops have been provided to promote participative ECE pedagogy. * The International Center for Research and Policy on Childhood at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (CIESPI at PUC-Rio) is working closely with a community advisory committee involving key partners locally and has developed a youth action group. This group is training young activists to work with young children to put into practice learning from SIPP, already supporting more than 100 children locally. Not only is this having immediate impacts, addressing the additional family and community pressures due to COVID-19, but the plan is for sustainable impact, with the young activists' commitment to long-term community contributions and future work in ECE. SIPP provides a framework for the research team to learn from each other and to build cross-national partnerships that link these contexts. SIPP is developing and strengthening links with existing networks and partnerships related to ECE. For example, as a result of the SIPP project, CIESPI team members have intensified their engagement with several key local and national institutions: CIESPI provides research material and supports 2 staff members to attend meetings of the national early childhood coalition for Brazil (RNPI National Coalition on Early Childhood); CIESPI contributes expert advice to the Children's Rights Council of Rio and of Sao Goncalo; and CIESPI had established a campaign to encourage parents to vaccinate young children, after identifying this as a need during SIPP fieldwork. Bethlehem University has made strong connections across academic disciplines, including participating in an ESRC symposium for community projects in the Arab region and sharing their framework for learning about ECE at an international conference organised by Cambridge University. The Children's Institute is a founding member of a new coalition aimed at bringing about law reform to improve ECD provision (Real Reform for ECD) and has presented on opportunities to strengthen ECE policy to the coalition members. The Institute is also strengthening its collaboration with the Children's Commissioner in the Western Cape, the region where the case community is located. University of Eswatini is working closely with the National Children's Services Department to ensure the collection of useful ECE data in the country. Sustainability Development Goals The project is an 'accelerator' in addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS), as it works across a number of key SDGs. Sustainable Development Goal 4 Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. (especially Targets 4.2, 4.a and 16.2) SIPP contributes to this SDG through demonstrating the economic case for ECE, influencing policy, and direct participatory research in the four case study communities. Certain impacts are evident from the first two years of the project. As described above, a Childhood Centre has been established in Masarah village (December 2020). The village had lacked ECE provision for children below the age of 4. In response to engaging with the project's preliminary scoping, including establishing a community advisory group and undertaking a needs assessment survey, the community donated space in the women's centre building to act as a Childhood Centre. Reflecting the diverse population of Palestine, Bethlehem University is also working with two other communities including the Aida refugee camp where they are supporting staff, volunteers and parents from the Youth Centre to build capacity to support ECE. The government of Eswatini's Early Childhood Care and Development and Education (ECCDE) Policy has been in draft form since 2009. It transpires from consultation with UNICEF that the policy development has been put on hold. UNICEF has supported the mapping of the ECCDE centres in the country through funding support from Global Partnership for Education. This mapping exercise establishes the ECCDE scope in the country and also determines gaps and challenges faced by these centres. The SIPP project in Eswatini is in constant consultation with UNICEF, National Children Services Department and Ministry of Education and Training (where two members of the Eswatini SIPP team are currently employed) to keep track of the process and establish where they can contribute. Members of the SIPP team from CIESPI at PUC-Rio have been advising two municipal Children's Rights Councils. A Rights Council is a federally mandated body that acts at the municipal, state and federal levels to develop policies for children and youth and to review certain children and youth budgets. The work is ongoing and they will be able to propose changes to the Plan based on emerging SIPP findings. The CIESPI SIPP team engaged with members of the National Coalition on Early Childhood to promote early childhood issues in the run-up to state and municipal elections. The CIESPI team contacted candidates in 2 municipalities with information about key early childhood issues and asked the candidates to sign a letter of commitment to prioritise early childhood. In relation to SDG 16.2 ('end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children'), in particular, SIPP brought forward the workpackage to build an economic case, showing the burden of violence in early childhood on children's subsequent learning and transition to formal education. The first step of this modelling - systematic reviews to identify studies reporting on the incidence and consequences of early childhood violence against children globally - is nearing completion. Sustainable Development Goal 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development: Significant effort has been put into strengthening the SIPP team, especially due to COVID-19. This includes the academic team and wider key Early Childhood Education (ECE) partners. All partner countries were highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Dec 2020, a celebration of the project's achievements was held that included the academic team plus third sector representatives (South Africa), staff from Ministry of Education (Eswatini), International organisations (Eswatini) and field researchers/ community members (Brazil, Palestine). Subsequent webinars have shared findings from policy (December 2021) and initial community case study fieldwork (September 2021) again with academic and policy stakeholders. Drawing from a June 2021 webinar on COVID, early career and established researchers from all country teams contributed to a peer reviewed journal article, published in Social Inclusion (February 2022). Monthly meetings are facilitated for the SIPP team to share information and discussion about creative research methods that we are using in the community case studies and wider research. The project emphasises capacity building across the teams and builds opportunities for team members to learn from each other: for example opportunities for team members to receive training to review academic papers for the WS5 literature review. As further detailed in the common question set, all partner countries have developed partnerships with local organisations and stakeholders within their case study community in order to ensure effectiveness and sustainability. Three country teams (Brazil, South Africa and UK) have further built on their children's rights partnerships, involving both early career and established researchers, to be part of the Management Committee for the successful 7 year Partnership grant for the International and Canadian Child Rights Partnership (2021-2028). Gender Equality * Measures to ensure equal and meaningful opportunities for people of different genders to be involved SIPP ensures equal and meaningful opportunities for people of different genders to be involved. This is built into the community fieldwork, in ensuring equitable participation by gender of both children and carers. One example of this is mothers in the three Palestinian communities who have approached the research team seeking support for ECE and have been received support based on their expressed needs (support to develop spaces for ECE in Masarah and Thabra, and capacity building/training in Aida refugee camp). * Impacts of the project on people of different genders SIPP's research team is providing opportunities for female leadership --including the PI, key leadership in every country team and many of the workstreams being women, and several early career researchers -- representing a positive shift in development research funding. Research now conclusively demonstrates that quality ECE improves outcomes particularly for those most disadvantaged (1). Thus the focus on safe and inclusive pedagogy in ECE is particularly advantageous in contexts where girls face potential inequalities. For example, in South Africa girls' and boys' experiences in early learning programmes are for the most part gendered and there is little attention to the importance of a gender-responsive pedagogy to equip children to benefit from schooling and to mitigate against gender-based violence later on. Safe and inclusive ECE protects children from gender-based violence (2). The role of schools in protecting children from violence is increasingly well established, and this recognition is being extended to ECE. For example, violence was endemic in the Brazilian community (favela) before COVID-19 and CIESPI's consultations have found accelerated domestic and community violence experienced by young children and their families. The community consultations have prioritised the need for ECE, as developed in Year 2, to address these issues. The ECE workforce is dominated by women in all 4 countries. The ECD sector is fragile, largely informal and has experienced widespread job losses following COVID-19. The project's focus on sustainable ECE, co-produced to maximise community and other resources, will support the female ECE workforce. ECE provision supports mothers, who in all 4 countries and case communities provide the majority of domestic care for young children. Built into SIPP is recognition and support of the role of mothers and other female kin carers, while also considering men's contributions. Demands have only increased with COVID-19, with increased rates of domestic instability and violence and rises in unemployment and poverty (3). As a result of the pandemic, ECE has been increasingly likely to take place in the home and mothers will be most impacted by this. Therefore SIPP team members have increased their focus on ECE within the home and family. In June 2021, SIPP held a successful public webinar on the impact of COVID-19's impact on how women and children in the community case studies have experienced the effects of the pandemic disproportionately due to historical marginalisation based on politics, poverty, racism and colonialism. WS 5 has nearly completed two global systematic reviews and will undertake 5 secondary analyses of cohort and other large datasets to understand the global burden of violence against children in the early years. Where possible, this data will be sex-disaggregated and will provide, for the first time, global data on the prevalence, consequences and costs of violence in the early years. * Impact on the relations between people of different genders and people of the same gender As above. Aspects of ECE provision (e.g. learning and play), violence and safety, female employment are highly relational. Thus SIPP outcomes will directly impact on relationships between people of different genders and people of the same gender, with the aim of positive societal and economic impacts. * How any risks and unintended negative consequences on gender equality have been avoided or mitigated against and monitored As part of its ethical approach, country teams are aware of power dynamics within communities and families in relation to gender. They are thus careful in terms of the methodologies used to ensure that power dynamics are suitably addressed. CIESPI's youth action group, who are being trained to work with young children, are more than half young women. * Any relevant outcomes and outputs being measured, with data disaggregated by age and gender SIPP will record the gender of participants in its community advisory groups in each country, and age and gender of community case study fieldwork participants. Age and gender are key components of WS 5 work on the economic case for ECE. * Any other impacts related to equality, diversity and inclusion In terms of the project's operations, recruitment of new research team members (Brazil, Palestine and South Africa) has been undertaken in light of equalities requirements. In particular, efforts have been made to ensure that the research teams reflect the ethnicities of the communities in which they will be working. Training opportunities have been offered on conducting systematic reviews, to at least one team member from each ODA country team. Secondary impacts As detailed in the common questions set, SIPP has fostered further collaborations. These include: the Children's Institute's partnership with Boston University, receiving seed funding to expand work in Vrygrond South Africa on violence prevention in families with young children; a successful funding application for UK collaboration with team members in Colombia, for a social enterprise pilot with marginalised Afrocolombian and Indigenous young people in the Colombian Pacific (2021) and (2022); a Postdoctoral Fellowship funded by the Basque Government, at the University of Edinburgh, addressing ECE (2021-23); and an ECE pedagogical programme in Scotland, Greece and the Czech Republic, funded by the Froebel Trust (2021-2024). Conclusion SIPP has completed its second year of funding, undertaken under COVID-19 restrictions which have substantially impacted on all 4 ODA country contexts and especially in the community case studies. It faced immense and unexpected pressures when needing to cut 60% of its budget from April 2021 to March 2022. It is a credit to the SIPP team that they prioritised ensuring early career researchers' employment, the community case study fieldwork and to continue with the project. SIPP is successfully meeting its research objectives, building strong partnerships with communities and stakeholders, and sharing its emerging findings through webinars and publications.

While it is difficult to assess the exact impact of this briefing, the fact that it was widely shared in twitter and social media by leading UN staff indicates its good perception. The visibility created by the briefing also resulted in an invitation to a workshop held at the LSE early 2018 about the regulation of everyday life in Palestine. Moreover, public engagement events such as high-level meetings with ILO officials are likely to have at least impact in the sense that it facilitates an ongoing involvement. Currently (02/2018), I am drafting a summary of my research insights to be included with the material the field office submits to the regional headquarters, where the ILO's annual report on the situation of Palestinian workers will be produced. It has yet to be seen how successful this attempt at influencing policy and UN practice will be (to be updated). Early 2018, I held a follow-up meeting with Christiane Kuptsch, Senior Migration Expert at the ILO in Geneva. My publication Mobility Equity in a Globalized World (World Development), benefitted from this meeting and came out of the visit to Harvard University as part of the fellowship. During the visit to the ILO headquarters, I also got a chance to talk to one of the researchers who worked on the Palestine annual report, and she said that the ILO team found the internal draft report I sent them very useful, although they could not quote from it directly due to ILO procedures and rules. Moreover, the project allowed the subsequent collaboration with the ILO MIGRATION branch in Geneva in the submission of a successful application to a New Investigator Grant, to begin May 2019. As part of the grant, I will work closely with ILO experts and thus managed to draw sustainable impact capacity from the initial postdoc fellowship. The grant has also contributed to a journal article that is currently under review at Settler Colonial Studies (if accepted details can be added later).",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8d6cbad340d4.75091514","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=5a8d6cbad340d4.75091514&grantRef=ES%2FP009905%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/P009905/1","119B5996-F5F0-4310-85B9-655047A3B082","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","E445A16D-CBC8-4141-9D37-972B47FFA589",NA,NA,NA,"Other",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Societal,Policy & public services",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ESRC","ES/P009905/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Social and Political Science","Fellowship","Hackl","Andreas",NA,"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5974-2530",NA,NA,NA,NA,"To Work and Back: Exploring Palestinian Labour Mobility and its Development Effects on the West Bank","04/01/2017","03/01/2018",0,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=ES/P009905/1","924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","E445A16D-CBC8-4141-9D37-972B47FFA589","School of Social and Political Science","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

However we have strongly supported the aims of the funding programme to generate research synergies in biologically linked areas. With this in mind we have outputs that map directly to this project that have demonstrated the key role of macrofauna (termites) in influencing the carbon cycle of tropical forests. We have also analysed how nutrients, soil microbes and soil carbon compounds influence the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon in tropical forests, suggesting that montane soils may be particularly temperature (warming) sensitive. We have published a new way to represent temperature responses that relies on the Ratkowsky equation approach, by considering minimum soil temperature as well as change with warming, avoids some of the limitations of the standard Arrhenius approach. We have also been the first to demonstrate that microbial diversity decreases with increased elevation on tropical mountains. This finding shows that microbial community responses, in terms of species diversity, follow similar patterns to those of plants and animals, a fundamental observation that has not been advanced upon since von Humboldt's first descriptions of species distribution and elevation in 1805. In the canopy our work has led to a paper demonstrating that tree death may be predictable from the reflectance signature of leaves (in Borneo). Finally this grant funding was partially related to work in Latin/Central America, and led to a soil warming experiment in tropical forest that showed a higher than expected temperature response in soil respiration and an increase in the respiration flux of approx 50% for a 4 degree C warming, higher than in other biomes.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5458cb55561f41.99201577","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=5458cb55561f41.99201577&grantRef=NE%2FK01627X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K01627X/1","C3365769-2F77-425D-88E5-F35155D33A3E","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","5664A7E8-95DC-4DCA-A6C2-9C72A6A7CA75",NA,NA,NA,"Education,Environment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cultural,Economic",2014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/K01627X/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Meir","Patrick",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BIODIVERSITY AND LAND-USE IMPACTS ON TROPICAL ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION (BALI)","30/09/2013","29/06/2019",415244,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K01627X/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","5664A7E8-95DC-4DCA-A6C2-9C72A6A7CA75","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

And then to identify the precise site where the sediments and biota would be representative of the North Sea. Stronger engagement with the local community was needed, to build confidence that this it was an experiment worth posting, with no adverse consequences, and the potential to provide a positive contribution towards Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions reduction campaign. Regulatory approval was needed from SEPA, Marine Scotland, an engagement with Scottish government. Existing contact networks assisted with progressing this rapidly, towards the correct responsible persons. Discovering a drilling contractor, and the practical activities of drilling a very unusual borehole, and in placing casing at within the unconsolidated sediment were major issues for the project director. Coordination of multiple teams of researchers to be on site before, at, and during the release timing was extremely difficult. The first results were surprising, and continue to be surprising. CO2 was injected, but much less released to the seabed that was anticipated. Subsequent calculations and surveying suggests that at least 80% has been dispersed and dissolved within pore water of the consolidated sediment. This provides, then, an unexpected high-performance mitigation against unintended CO2 release into seawater. An additional surprise was the linear array of leakage to the seabed, which indicates that fractures have formed unexpectedly in consolidated sediment, even with these slow release rates, designed to be representative of known release fluxes from boreholes which leak unintentionally. The quality of the imaging, the instrumental recording, and the seabed observations has now combined into very robust and high quality results, giving a clear progress that CO2 release at the seabed his less damaging than anticipated, but will clear and recover within the timescales of the theoretical models used by PML, before this experiment occurred.

Presentation of REFINE activities and outputs through these routes has resulted in complementary national (PACIFIC, EPSRC UK) and international (SACSESS, EU; GENIORS, EU) research programmes focussed on the development and application of pyroprocessing, involving national laboratories and industrial partners. Indeed NNL now has its own complementary pyroprocessing research programme, focussed on industrial application, as a result of REFINE activities. REFINE outputs (both people and research outputs) have been seen as a key component of UK reprocessing research, which has been recognised by both the EPSRC Independent review of Fisson and Fusion and by NIRAB as world leading. This has resulted in the NIRAB recommendations to UK Government that the work of the REFINE pyrochemical reprocessing research programme be further developed, and the award of the open access DECC Pyroprocessing Research Laboratory to Edinburgh to facilitate the R&D required to demonstrate all the necessary elements of pyrochemical reprocessing at laboratory scale. Invited presentations, symposia and other discussions and awards have resulted in developing connections with significant R&D activities in China, Japan and India. Professor Mount has been appointed to the Scottish Science Advisory Council and, informed by REFINE developments, has led the provision of clean energy advice to Scottish Government, and now, with REFINE colleagues, as Chair and members of the UK Molten Salts Advisory Group, to UK Government. All of the above reflects the impact on UK and international policy, in demonstrating a route to clean closed cycle nuclear reprocessing of next generation fuels and in associated thermal energy systems, in convincing UK Government and others of the need for these developments, and in establishing the critical mass of researchers in the UK to address this. The recent successful consortium bid to the Advanced Fuel Cycle Programme (AFCP) in pyroprocessing, led by Porf Mount at Edinburgh, will enable the strategic development of pyroprocessing for innovation and impact in zero carbon energy, as outlined the UK Nuclear innovation Plan (NIP).",NA,NA,NA,NA,"56e05d91665d63.23474939","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=impactsummary&outcomeId=56e05d91665d63.23474939&grantRef=EP%2FJ000779%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/J000779/1","A2252169-D6E7-4BED-9967-EC12361FD202","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","CF138913-CAA2-4634-B67A-FAFFF82CC01D",NA,NA,NA,"Energy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Policy & public services",2017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/J000779/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Chemistry","Research Grant","Mount","Andrew",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"REFINE: A coordinated materials programme for the sustainable REduction of spent Fuel vital In a closed loop Nuclear Energy cycle","30/09/2011","30/03/2016",1099514,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/J000779/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","CF138913-CAA2-4634-B67A-FAFFF82CC01D","School of Chemistry","College of Science and Engineering"

This has recently included &pound;15M Gates Foundation funding to establish the Centre for Tropical Livestock Genetics & Health to implement genetic gain and treatments in support of farmers in low- and middle-income farmers, including to control endemic and zoonotic diseases. It has also driven dozens of productive collaborations with industry via contracts and leveraging schemes, leading to &pound;10M private equity investment to form Roslin Technologies to commercialise our research and construction of a new &pound;32M Innovation Centre adjacent to the Institute to engage and grow businesses. Moreover, the expertise supported by this funding has attracted major investment in Agri-Tech Centres at Easter Bush funded by InnovateUK (Centre for Innovation Excellence in Livestock & Agri-EPI). These Centres will increase national capacity for infectious challenge in farmed animals, gene editing and collection of novel phenotypes and be linked to stakeholders throughout the food supply chain.

That while cold-water corals can acclimate to ocean acidification, this comes at a cost to the skeletal structure, with new skeleton being less organised in terms of crystal structure. That different species of cold-water coral differ with regard to their sensitivity to predicted changes in environmental variables. That the cold-water coral Desmophlum dianthus was more sensitive to changes in temperature than ocean acidification, and shifted from a mixed use of protein and fats for energy, to protein based energy when subjected to predicted future conditions, which is a much less efficient use of energy. Coral skeleton that is exposed to projected ocean acidification conditions starts to dissolve, making then approximately 20% weaker than currently. This has large implications for the scale of structure they can support, meaning that while cold-water corals may be able to survive in projected conditions to some degree, it is likely that the reef structures themselves will become smaller, possibly collapsing in on themselves. This means that cold-water coral reefs of the future may support less biodiversity than at present. Developed predictive maps for the presence of cold-water corals using water depth, habitat rugosity and current speeds. Predictive maps of live corals will be especially valuable for future long-term monitoring surveys, including those needed to understand the impacts of global climate change. Discovered a new ecological process in coral reef formation; the Free Living Stabilisation Hypothesis describes how certain coral species can settle on mobile substrate and grow to reef stabilising proportions, creating reefs in previously unstable habitats.

Sustainable agricultural intensification (SAI) is the term for systems seeking to balance production impacts. In the context of Brazilian agriculture, the focus is on livestock systems and their impacts on extensive land use. We showed how it is possible to maintain levels of beef production while minimising GHGs and reducing (land) extensive production and deforestation. The latter therefore obviates the loss of globally significant ecosystem services. The focus of this UK-Brazil collaboration has been on the development of a bio economic optimisation model to evaluate SAI trade-offs at relevant scales (e.g. farm to regional). The work also links beef demand scenarios with levels of intensification through the restoration of degraded pastures, animal feedlot finishing and feed supplementation, and how these factors influence overall emissions management and deforestation scenarios. The model EAGGLE (Economic Analysis of Greenhouse Gas from Livestock Emissions), was used to develop a clear policy strategy to determine the potential to reduce related GHGs and associated policy costs. This is important because emissions reductions from this sector are a central pillar of Brazil's international commitments made at the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016. Our peer-reviewed outputs substantiate the scientific basis of the current proposal. The work has also been featured on>100 blog and environmental web sites. ODA relevance Agricultural development is central to Brazil's national economic growth objective. However, the country is struggling with the tension between the need for economic growth in the sector (and livestock production in particular) and environmental commitments including the conservation of biodiversity-rich biomes in the Amazon and the Cerrado. The global and domestic consequences of Brazilian deforestation is receiving significant recent media attention.

A reflection of the importance of our contribution is that our papers are cited in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on Climate Change and Land (2019), which now takes a more balanced view of this issue, and states: Mitigation potential of diet shifts (less meat-dependent) may be lower than often considered due to rebound effects. Furthermore, in specific systems when soil organic carbon sequestration is taken into account, variations in GHGs as a response to demand can be negligible. [5.9]. The IPCC was created by the UN to provide global policymakers with regular and objective scientific assessments on climate change; thus, IPCC's views on the GHG effects of reducing meat consumption will have significant influence in the global discussion on the issue.

The farmers interviewed consistently talked in terms of having developed practices which were appropriate for their environments, labour availability and the markets they were aiming to supply. The increasingly complex requirements for agriculture to meet aspirations in food production, ecosystem services and mitigating climate change requires a difficult balancing act to be achieved. Different types of farmer therefore responded in different ways to methane reduction initiatives. Specialist beef (and lesser extent sheep) farmers saw improved production efficiency as the way forward. Farmers selling direct to consumers or relying heavily on environmental payments preferred to consider practices which increase carbon storage e.g. pasture management. Farmers interviewed found it difficult to accept the assertion that methane produced by cattle and sheep is a major contributor to global warming. They did not find figures quoted for methane emissions, particularly from grass fed animals, to be credible, and they viewed methane as a natural and inevitable part of farming sheep and cattle.

When this char has been produced specifically to have beneficial effects - for example as a soil improver or to store carbon - we call this material biochar. The thermal process used to produce biochar is known as pyrolysis, and by altering the pyrolysis conditions, it's possible to change the character of the biochar. In general higher pyrolysis temperatures mean a smaller amount of char, but containing a greater proportion of highly stable carbon. This carbon seems to remain sequestered in biochar for centuries, and so sustainable biochar production could be a powerful tool in the fight against anthropogenic climate change. There is strong evidence that biochar can also have some beneficial effects when added to soils. Its highly porous structure can act like a slow-release 'sponge' for water and useful soil nutrients. Biochar can be made from almost any type of dry biomass - including waste materials.

We found that seasonal land precipitation changes vary quite a bit with observational dataset used, but significant climate changes can be identified in zonal patterns in some seasons. The changes approximately strengthen climatological rainfall differences. This work was included in Chapter 10 of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Changes of precipitation over both land and ocean in climatological wet and dry regions were found to be consistent with expectations due to greenhouse gas warming of the atmosphere, with the wet regions becoming wetter and dry regions becoming drier. By analysing changes in the wettest and driest regions, we were able to make use of the relativity short satellite records to show that human activity has caused changes to precipitation over the ocean. While greenhouse gas warming will cause precipitation to increase globally, aerosols tend to have the opposite affect. These counteracting influences, has made it difficult to distinguish the influence of aerosols on precipitation from greenhouse gases as many regions, the influence of greenhouse gases in greater. We analysed changes in monsoon precipitation and were able to show that anthropogenic aerosols caused a monsoon precipitation to decrease over the latter half of the 20th century. Changes in the global water cycle are still uncertain compared to temperature due to shorter observational datasets and sparse coverage in many regions. A workshop bringing together experts on observational records of the water cycle was organised to discuss the long-term observed changes.

At the same time we have calculated that a substantial fraction of climate change over the past few hundred years can be clearly associated with other external influences, with the majority of externally forced change in the pre-20th century era due to large volcanic eruptions and changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases. The project has found that the resulting residual climate variability (i.e. the past changes in temperature not due to external forcings) shows trends that are smaller than those over the past 50 or 60 years. This is important as it shows that it is unlikely that internal forcing alone can be responsible for the recent observed warming trend, a research product highlighted in chapter 10 of the recent IPCC AR5 WGI report.

The original grant proposal formed part of a larger ESF proposal (CHECREEF) submitted through the EuroMARC Programme. The CHECREEF project involved research related to two IODP reef drilling targets: Tahiti (drilled as Expedition 310) and the Australian Great Barrier Reef (recently drilled as Expedition 325). In both cases the key objectives of the IODP drilling were to elucidate the rates, mechanisms and drivers of sea level and tropical climate change during the last deglaciation and during previous glacial periods. Our NERC-funded contribution was to help lead in the Site Survey Cruise for the Australian Great Barrier Reef component of this work, and more specifically to help lead in the identification of sites and targets for subsequent drilling. Results: Site Survey Cruise: The NERC grant made a significant contribution to funding the Site Survey Cruise on the Great Barrier Reef using CSIRO ship 'Southern Surveyor' on cruise SS07/2007, 26th September to 16th October 2007. As a consequence of the funding, Tudhope (Edinburgh) and Thomas (Oxford) were participants in that cruise and were thus able to make a substantive contribution to the collection of the seabed samples and data (seismic, swath imaging and AUV photographic data) required to identify drilling targets and to ensure that all IODP and Australian safety and environmental considerations were satisfied prior to approval of drilling. U-series dating: A key objective of the NERC-funded work was to provide preliminary age estimates of dredged material to guide subsequent IODP drilling. U-Th dating was performed at the University of Oxford. Six corals from the drowned reefs on the shelf edge were measured: 2 from the northerly Ribbon Reef site in 46-48 m of water and 4 from the Hydrographers Passage to the south in 88-92 m of water. These produced ages ranging from 23&plusmn;21 years to 19,190&plusmn;80 years. This indicated that, although the reef-like features observed by multibeam bathymetry were experiencing modern coral growth, there was material of deglacial age on the surface of some of these features. This was the first confirmation that these features comprised deglacial reefs, and therefore demonstrated the potential for IODP drilling. A further three corals from a much deeper water site (Gloria Knolls) were also dated. These samples required a stepwise cleaning procedure and multiple measurements to correct of initial 230Th contamination and hence provide reliable ages. These samples returned ages from 1070&plusmn;30 years to 302,000&plusmn;19,000 years, providing insight into the age of formation of the knolls as well as the longevity of the deep marine ecosystem they are sustaining. IODP Expedition 325: The research reported here made a significant contribution to ensuring the successful IODP drilling of the Great Barrier Reef as Expedition 325 (GBREC) in early 2009. In particular, the selection of drill sites on the basis of seabed and sub-seabed surveys and the U-Th dating of dredged samples proved to be an outstanding success as the drill cores successfully sampled all the key time intervals that had been targeted. This included reefs that grew during the last glacial maximum (the first time such reefs have been sampled), through the first half of the deglaciation, including periods of extremely rapid sea level rise, and during previous glacial periods. This has provided a unique set of samples with which to address the key scientific objectives concerning the rates, mechanisms and drivers of sea level and tropical climate change. Alex Thomas (Oxford) and Alexander Tudhope (Edinburgh) are Expedition scientists in this work, and (with Henderson in Oxford) have been funded through subsequent NERC IODP grants to ensure continued UK leadership in the science.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"54637d9ed42287.06464502","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=54637d9ed42287.06464502&grantRef=NE%2FF52330X%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/F52330X/1","840D3F9E-5B92-41CD-A353-DED414293C14","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","22CF49FE-CD3D-4768-BCDF-08E85460E6DA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"This work led to the successful scientific drilling of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia (IODP Expedition 325) to reveal new insights into the rates and timings of past sea level and climate change in the region.","Environment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/F52330X/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Tudhope","Alexander","William",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The last deglacial sea-level &amp; climate changes.Coral reef records in Checreef: South Pacific: Tahiti (French Polynesia) IODP expedition","31/08/2007","30/08/2010",30959,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/F52330X/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","22CF49FE-CD3D-4768-BCDF-08E85460E6DA","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

This means that most of the ES literature is helpful to explore intra-State dimensions of equity and fairness, but only little research is available to contextualise ES from an inter-State perspective. It is thus difficult to rely on existing ES research to better understand ES flows from the local to the global level and vice versa, which is essential for marine ecosystems.+ SDGs - Non-economical values: A better understanding of marine supporting, regulating and cultural services is still needed not only for the realization of the full potential of the ES concept(s) towards human wellbeing, but also to implement the ecosystem approach. - Equity and poverty alleviation: It is helpful to contrast the lack of clarity on the link between equity and ecosystem services with intra- and inter-generational equity components of the international obligations concerning the ecosystem approach, which provides a broader and complementary framework than the ES framework alone, especially when considering wellbeing in all its forms and poverty in all its dimensions. - Marine context: There are still few ES studies that explore marine systems, and of these none explores the linkages between marine ecosystem systems and poverty alleviation. Beyond the ES literature, however, an extensive body of literature exists on the human dimensions of small-scale fisheries including poverty and livelihood security considerations. A systemic interpretation of the ecosystem approach in light of international instruments including the CBD Chennai Guidance for the Integration of Biodiversity and Poverty Eradication, the FAO Small-Scale Fishing Guidelines and the Sustainable Development Goals, can help fill the gap. .* Several of the multiple dimensions of poverty (as reflected in the SDG 1) rest also on international human rights law, notably the right to food (linked with SDG 2 and the FAO Small Scale Fisheries (SSF) Guidelines).

"NERC","NE/K010395/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Patenaude","Genevieve",NA,NA,"The project delivered significant new knowledge: Understanding how human well-being changes with land use intensification is key in the pursuit of global goals for development and sustainable production. Land use intensification has poorly understood consequences for the rural poor, as it may undermine the ecosystem services upon which they depend. We examined how wellbeing changed along three common Land use intensity pathways in Mozambique: smallholder commercial crop production, charcoal production, and subsistence crop cultivation. Those pathways are also found in other Sub-Saharan African Countries, so our findings resonate beyond Mozambique. Wellbeing improved with agricultural-based intensification pathways, whereas wellbeing did not change with intensification of charcoal production. Wellbeing for the poorest were dependent on accessible markets. Socio-economic benefits from agricultural intensification and expansion may overcome localised environmental trade-offs, but effective forest policies are needed to promote long-term wellbeing outcomes from charcoal production. Our findings specific to charcoal production are as follows: Charcoal is the main cooking energy source for people living in Maputo city. It is also a crucial source of income for rural producers in Mabalane district, a key supplier of Maputo's charcoal. But Mabalane's forests - which provide the wood for charcoal - also supply rural populations with construction materials, firewood and food. Our research shows that the lack of community management in Mabalane's charcoal trade has disadvantaged communities, widening income inequality and causing ecological depletion. To reverse these trends, we recommended that policymakers strengthen community management institutions, install sustainable management practices, review existing licensing schemes and seek affordable alternative energy sources. This will help ensure the charcoal trade operates in an inclusive and sustainable way. Our findings related to Soya farming are as follows: Agriculture is an important engine for economic growth in Africa, but effective agricultural strategies to support rural development and poverty alleviation are scarce. State investment in the small-scale farming sector is minimal and the entrepreneurial family farm sector remains underrepresented. Meanwhile, large-scale land investments are advocated as means to bring capital to rural areas and stimulate development. However, the investigation of soya production in Central Mozambique presented in ACES suggested that small-scale farming can produce similar profits to large-scale operations and better social outcomes. Concentrating only on large-scale investments can mean forgoing opportunities for rural development and poverty reduction. With the right support, poorer households can develop market-oriented farming that contributes to local value chains at many levels. As an interdisciplinary project, ACES had to develop significant innovative methods for research at the nexus of social and natural sciences (participatory rural appraisal along with ecological surveys), these methods are described in the various peer-reviewed publications that emerged as a result of the project. A number of particularly noteworthy research networks/collaborations/partnerships also resulted from ACES's influence, noteworthy are the creation of a research station in Mabalane for testing approaches to improve forest management and charcoal production in Mozambique and the emergence of several international projects and collaborations (MIDLAND - https://erc-midland.earth/ and the NERC funded 'A Socio-Ecological Observatory for the Southern African Woodlands' project, to name but a few).

"AHRC","AH/V006371/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Crowley","Katherine",NA,NA,"This project has brought together a community of practice on climate change adaptation through the lens of cultural heritage. It has enabled four research groups from Sri Lanka, Indonesia, South Africa and Scotland to come together, gather data, analyse and share a diversity of voices on local level vulnerability and adaptive capacity. The project, so far, has delivered four interdisciplinary research workshops, undertaken three sets of field work in the low middle income countries (LMIC), developed a set of climate profiles for each site as well as enabling various local community focussed events and workshops. We have also produced a series of blogs. We are building ArcGIS StoryMaps to communicate and disseminate findings and are currently co-designing an open access free e-learning package on cultural heritage risk assessment and adaptation (due for completion in May 2022). . The CRITICAL project works in partnership across Sri Lanka, South Africa and Indonesia and combined heritage management, cultural geography and climate risk research to form a Community of Practice (CoP) focused on LMICs to: 1) identify the key indicators and parameters of cultural value and vulnerability for CH impact assessment; 2) test and deliver a co-created impact and risk framework for decision-making, and 3) share resulting tools and learning through capacity building and translate research for policy. A joint team led by University of Edinburgh (UoE) in partnership with Universitas Gadja Mada (UGM), Indonesia; the University of Pretoria (UoPr), South Africa; and our independent researcher working remotely in Sri Lanka have collected and are now sharing a diversity of experiences, knowledge and skills via a portfolio of pilot research case studies from LMICs on cultural value for climate and disaster risk assessment In summary: The South Africa team have identified the influence of world heritage status on the vulnerability of one of the most isolated and deprived rural areas, as well as the cultural significance of traditional foods that are under threat from the western view of protecting heritage sites. In Indonesia the team have identified the importance and cultural value of an urban river system and are currently expanding their work to explore the wider urban setting of Yogyakarta, and the city's bid to become a city-wide UNESCO World Heritage Site. The river's cultural narrative is critical in understanding local adaptive capacity and vulnerabilities over time, and how cultural heritage is a dynamic force not just something to be preserved. In Sri Lanka, our work has identified the importance of local water supplies and the cultural connections for women and their livelihoods. The project has also implemented engagement with communities in Sri Lanka through school-based art competitions as well as community workshops and ceremonies. The narratives emerging from the three sites align with the results of two desk-based literature reviews that have identified the serious lack of understanding and integration of intangible cultural heritage, community level engagement, and cultural value in risk assessments for climate change adaptation and disaster management. The literature reviews found: * Despite many of these papers discussing the importance of risk assessment and all its components (vulnerability, hazard, exposure, and capacity) the majority focus on just exposure or hazard modelling. * The tools developed and discussed in these papers identified the exposure of cultural heritage to hazards but not the degree of vulnerability or contribution towards capacity. Those that did discuss vulnerability did so largely in relation to exposure or focussed substantially on the structural vulnerabilities of the built environment. * Challenges for climate risk assessment predominately focus on a lack of data, tools and capacity. * Papers highlight a significant range of barriers to adaptation including a lack of understanding of vulnerability, a conventionally 'top-down' approach, lack of decision maker awareness, low level of communications between different stakeholders and a lack of policies or regulations. * The discourse across the literature is dominated by the drive to protect or conserve heritage. * There is a lack of awareness of heritage benefits for adaptation. * Only one other paper notes that lack of understanding between the threats to cultural heritage and wellbeing of the local communities. The project team have successfully carried out field-based research in the three settings, using both in-person and remote methods. Building on long term relationships with local community members and stakeholders, research from the three LMICs has captured the views and values of the most vulnerable people. At a level local, the joint interdisciplinary research team has identified core assets that are critical for adaptation and resilience in the three case study sites. This research has identified local level needs in relation to climate resilience through the lens of understanding local heritage and using heritage as a tool for engagement and empowerment. In Indonesia the team, Dr Retnowati and Ms Anantasari (GAMA-InaTEK, Universitas Gadja Mada), have examined the role of a key river system as heritage. Interviews, desk study, and field observation were conducted to better understand and identify the heritage of Yogyakarta city and the natural landscape of the province stretching from Merapi volcanic area southward along the main southern rivers to the sea. Changing climate trends and weather hazards are gradually impacting on rural areas on the outskirts of, and within the city, of Yogyakarta city, Central Java. This river system flows from a volcano through the city of Yogyakarta to the south ocean in Java. It is culturally important to the people who live within Yogyakarta as it marks a cosmological axis described in Javanese culture. The city is currently applying for World Heritage status and our researchers are now using their findings to contribute to this process and ensure that natural hazard impacts are taken into account. There is a strong interconnectivity between the community and the cosmological axis. The rivers shape the whole landscape as part of the axis that connects Merapi volcano, the Sultanate Palace, and the Parangtiris coast. These locations symbolize human and the spiritual aspect (God) connections. This philosophical heritage is repeatedly introduced to visitors spending their time in Yogyakarta. However, findings from this research indicated that the connection between river, people, and the historical buildings have not been described distinctly in the proposal document to the UNESCO for the city's WHS proposal. In Sri Lanka, our lead researcher, Dr Karunarathna, explored environmental folklore (Intangible Heritage) focussed on small-scale tank cascade village cultures. Heritage studies of South Asia in general, and Sri Lanka in particular, have tended to assign a less prominent place to the intangible heritage mainly environmental folklore. This neglected research data materials elaborately magnify the local ecological knowledge, traditional livelihood, contemporary social norms and dynamics, and harmonious connection between culture and nature. In South Africa, Prof O'Connell and Ms Niemand, University of Pretoria, examined two sets of concerns - coloniality and climate which can confidently be expected to dominate public/ political and intellectual agendas for the foreseeable future. This project puts these concerns into focus, looking at complex questions of ways of life and the long reach of oppressive histories in Elandskloof, a village South Africa's Cedarberg region. The project understands the climate emergency as primarily a human rights catastrophe. Elandskloof - a place that was subject to race-based forced removals and the first 'successful' land restitution case in South Africa us this site becomes a space of ongoing engagement, and a ground zero of the catastrophic convergence of the colonial frontier with a climate change frontier - and the resultant human toll. Examining vulnerable and forgotten communities - single sites in particular - is utterly crucial. Forgotten communities require context-specific approaches to support them taking into account histories, livelihood portfolios and likely climate change impacts. This team used participatory work with the community (in groups as well as individual interviews) as well as paper-based questionnaires to examine how notions of community, resilience and sustainability are thought about and deployed by those living in Elandskloof. In this light, our first workshop at the end of 2021 shed some light on how the community functions in terms of understanding key links and further ideas around trust. It is clear that this community has not been kept abreast of climatic changes, and they were at pains to impress that they have had no input or guidance from any accredited source, relying on radio stations and newspapers with regard to, for example, the crippling drought that ravaged the Western Cape during the last decade. A second workshop was undertaken in early February 2022 asked questions on the meaning of heritage in particular food heritage for the community? What does heritage mean to them? It explored issues of loss of traditional knowledge of the weather and a connection with their land and is climate change causing their relationship with the land and place to change or will it in the future? There has been little, if any, attention paid to capturing the rich personal and collective histories of this community; recipes, ways of life with regard to religion, employment, marriages, and movements among others that point to a community held hostage to their past, and without the necessary tools to survive and flourish. There is a thread of abandonment, of being forgotten, and the inability to find a platform from which to imagine and chart a different path. Further achievements have been made such as sharing findings at international fora such as Climate Expo 17-21st May 2021 hosted by the COP26 Universities Network and a special meeting of IPCC UNESCO, and ICOMOS between 6th -10th December 2021. This project is ongoing but we have met the majority of our objectives and are on track to complete them all by June 2022. Furthermore, with an extension and follow on funding we are also able to deliver a cross-AHRC/DCMS urgency grant portfolio policy ready report by June 2022. We have identified key assets and their vulnerabilities and capacities in all three sites, we have co-designed an approach to examine risk through a heritage lens and we have developed the materials and lessons for a capacity buildings package. Additional to this we will deliver a future research road and policy brief. We have held multiple workshops on heritage assets identification, risk framework co-development and lesson sharing. We have also held climate dissemination events in South Africa and Sri Lanka.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"6218ad0980ce60.42909881","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=6218ad0980ce60.42909881&grantRef=AH%2FV006371%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/V006371/1","810624EF-52CF-468E-89D8-9EE4D52C103E","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","CF0C68F8-E01C-4D27-B2D0-440EE9023567",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Our community of practice will outlive the end of this project, we have made a strong network of researcher across four countries and we anticipate future collaborative work together.

"NERC","NE/H014268/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Tudhope","Alexander",NA,NA,"Background: The project had two components: a) MODERN CORALS: analysis of modern corals for calibration and benchmarking to aid subsequent palaeoclimate and water depth reconstruction, and, b) FOSSIL CORALS: geochemical analysis of fossil corals from the GBREC cores to reconstruct climate and sealevel change from the last glacial maximum to ~10ka BP. Summary of main achievements, outcomes and significance: a) MODERN CORALS: * We have demonstrated that skeletal del13C of Isopora corals varies as a function of water depth, thereby supporting the hypothesis presented in our proposal. Despite the anticipated scatter, there is a highly significant difference (of ~0.5‰; p<0.01; Mann-Whitney U Test) between the composition of corals from 0-2m and those from 5-12m water depth at the same reef. This supports the potential use of coral del13C as an aid to palaeowater depth reconstruction. Importantly, Isopora is the dominant well-preserved coral in the GBREC cores. * We, along with Expedition 325 colleagues, have used high resolution sampling to demonstrate that skeletal del18O and Sr/Ca of modern Isopora and Porites corals in the region record seasonality and changes in mean temperature and water composition, thereby supporting their potential for climate reconstruction in the GBREC cores. b) FOSSIL CORALS: * Our results, along with those of other Expedition 325 colleagues, are providing reconstructions of sea level and climate of the LGM through the first half of the last deglaciation. Oxygen isotopic composition is recording the combined influences of sea level, temperature and regional water isotopic composition change. Sr/Ca analyses are suggesting the LGM was ~2-4 &deg; C cooler than present. When this is compared with the skeletal del18O changes (LGM-present ~3‰) we infer a major regional freshening over the deglaciation and Holocene. We have also discovered a significantly steepened meridional temperature gradient along the Great Barrier Reef Region during the deglaciation (published in Nature Communications). This work provides new constraints on our understanding of the ability of corals and coral reefs to respond to rapid climate and sea level change. * Skeletal del13C records capture changes from the LGM into the early deglaciation and through to the pre-industrial that are similar to those recorded in the EPICA ice core and interpreted as reflecting changes in the global carbon cycle. More data (to come from colleagues) will allow us to assess evidence for rapid sea level changes as per the results from modern corals.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"54638f32d77ed8.52925319","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=54638f32d77ed8.52925319&grantRef=NE%2FH014268%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/H014268/1","B683FBFB-3267-4423-BCC6-A3F40BB902ED","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","22CF49FE-CD3D-4768-BCDF-08E85460E6DA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Our findings on the ability of reefs to cope with previous rapid sea level and climate change may have implications for the management of the Great Barrier Reef in the face of future climate change.","Environment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/H014268/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Tudhope","Alexander","William",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sea level and climate change from geochemical analysis of corals from the Great Barrier Reef: IODP Expedition 325","30/09/2010","29/09/2012",39528,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/H014268/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","22CF49FE-CD3D-4768-BCDF-08E85460E6DA","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

"EPSRC","EP/M008215/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Social and Political Science","Webb","Janette",NA,NA,"1. The 'problem' of low carbon heat and low energy buildings is framed in different ways in each of our comparator European states: Denmark, Germany and UK, depending on the 20th century history of building standards and heat provision and current co-evolution of policy and legacy energy network and building infrastructures. * Timing of construction and of increasing energy efficiency standards mean all three countries have significant potential across building stock to reduce final energy demand for heat. Construction standards in the UK have lagged European comparators but given the age of the stocks this is a relatively minor effect. All three countries have large proportion of buildings whose efficiency could be improved. * Distinctive energy governance institutions and regulations have co-evolved with particular heat supply infrastructures. For example, Danish energy taxes developed with the deployment of district heating (DH) from combined heat and power generation (CHP) and reflect a symbiotic relationship between central and municipal government; UK nationalised industries operated as autonomous corporations (with on-going controversy over the opportunity cost of their use of capital) with limited integration/coordination and exclusion of local government; German stadtwerke contributed both symbolically and financially to municipal self determination, and their resurrection resonates with these values. These differences, along with resource endowments, account for different socio-technical configurations of energy supply for heating, and distinctive future strategies for low carbon buildings, in the three countries. * Fuel poverty is defined as a specific object of policy only in the UK, and not in Denmark or Germany where low incomes and difficulty paying bills are dealt with through social transfers. The particularities of UK fuel poverty policy are partly a result of the formal separation between the privatised energy industry and democratic government. In addition, the UK fuel poverty policy focus has increasingly moved from energy price per se to measures for improved home energy efficiency as a means to reduce household bills. Hence Energy Company Obligation funding is increasingly targeted on those defined as fuel poor. * The low carbon heat option space in high level energy systems' scenarios differs between countries. In particular, Danish and German rejection of both nuclear and CCS lead to (a) a relatively narrow range of options for decarbonising heat for buildings (b) a stronger emphasis on energy efficiency than in the UK. In addition there is differentiation between UK countries: Scottish policy is opposed to new nuclear power, but conversion of the gas grid to hydrogen, using steam methane reforming with CCS, is regarded as an option. UK Government policy is pro-nuclear, but funding for CCS demonstration projects has been withdrawn. * Accelerating progress in urban low carbon and low energy heat infrastructure is proving difficult to effect in all three European states. The absence of a pressing infrastructural crisis, which worked historically to drive transformation, means that appetite for major overhaul [and the implied disruption to millions of building occupants and owners] is limited both in city and national governments. Denmark has retained institutional capacity for energy planning, but the focus is on incremental expansion of existing heat networks; Germany sees high potential in transforming energy inputs to DH networks, but there is disagreement about intensifying usage of the existing networks, as opposed to shifting to smaller scale community-owned heat systems; in the UK there are high levels of uncertainty about future heat and energy efficiency policies, and the role of technologies such as district heating. The absence of a governance structure for decisions about the future of the methane gas grid is significant in stalling other investment decisions. * Differences between future energy supply scenarios are consequential for government energy efficiency policies. In the UK where energy supply is regarded as open to a wide range of future options, energy efficiency policy is least clearly articulated. Formal energy scenarios use highly varied energy efficiency targets; several high profile energy efficiency policies have failed, and there is no stable benchmark against which to judge progress. The consequences of failed policies and limited progress against targets are unclear. In contrast with the UK, German policymakers have adopted a rule-of-thumb annual target for renovation of 2% of the building stock; this envisages progress along a steady trajectory to the 2050 target of an 80% reduction in primary non-renewable energy for heat. Danish Government policy treats energy efficiency improvements as central to minimising the cost of renewable energy heat systems; it emphasises the role of building control in ensuring buildings are energetically future proofed whenever they are renovated. * Denmark, Germany and the UK have similar initiatives to stimulate new markets in low carbon heat and energy efficiency in buildings. These include moves to: link the value of energy efficiency improvements to house prices; subsidise renewable heat generation and heat infrastructure; construct advice and information portals. Progress is however slow, and generally regarded as insufficient to meet national low carbon and energy saving targets for buildings. Even in the UK, which lacks a benchmark against which to judge the trajectory of energy efficiency, recent increases in emissions from the domestic sector have caused the Committee on Climate Change to express concern. * The use of economic metrics to justify specific policy design differs between countries: * Renewable heat: UK policy is tightly governed by a model of the economically rational consumer, and uses rule-based degression; the German subsidy system is tailored to achieve target outcomes on a trial-and-error rather than econometric basis, which is viewed as lacking transparency for the sustainable heat industry. * Energy efficiency standards for new buildings: UK regulation is responsive to commercial interests (through formal calculations) which tends to prevent significant tightening of standards; German regulation is derived from calculations designed to meet a 2020 net zero energy standard for buildings, and requires a high level of renewable energy for heating or efficient use of fuel through combined heat and power; Danish policy pushes standards beyond what is calculated as 'cost optimal' in economic terms. * Rules governing economic calculation of cost optimal investments in each country respond to prior policy objectives, but are not determined by them. This is demonstrated in differential applications of cost-benefit analysis for energy efficiency and for district heating under EU Directive reporting. * Policy objectives differ in their flexibility. For example, offsetting heat supply against fabric efficiency standards is regarded as legitimate in Germany and UK, but resisted in Denmark. * Heat and energy efficiency policies address supply and network infrastructures and building-level change. This breadth means policies interact with a wide variety of sociotechnical structures. One of these is taxation structures which have been regarded as obstacles to progress on sustainable heat in each country, but in different ways. In Denmark high taxes on electricity, and practical limitations on taxing biomass, mean that biomass is financially more attractive than electric heat pumps; socioeconomic analysis concludes however that electrification is preferable from a societal perspective. Tax reform is difficult because lowering electricity taxation would have potentially significant impacts on state revenues, and increasing taxes on biomass is administratively challenging, because of the non-energy uses of the material. In Germany a proposal to offer households reductions in income tax when improving the energy performance of their buildings was widely regarded as promising to reach significant segments of the population who are averse to debt financing (through KfW loans). Nonetheless necessary agreement between the L&auml;nder proved impossible due to the differential implications for their tax revenues, and the policy has been abandoned. In the UK low VAT rates on domestic energy are interpreted by some as an implicit carbon subsidy, and are identified in policy debates (e.g. by the Committee on Climate Change) as undermining financial incentives for low carbon supply and improved energy efficiency. However, the importance of fuel poverty mitigation in energy policy means that proposals to raise the cost of energy are highly contested. * In each country, scenario analyses of future heat network infrastructure illustrate challenges of developing or changing energy infrastructure in liberalised markets. In Germany a national socioeconomic cost benefit assessment found significant potential for expanded district heating, but this would require high rates of connection in district heating areas, implying government direction of building owners' heat supply choices; this is currently considered politically unpalatable. In the UK official assessment of the socioeconomic potential for district heating ranges from 3% to 39%. This breadth illustrates the sensitivity of estimates of district heating potential to modelling assumptions. In these ways the German and UK cases illustrate difficulties in using economic calculation to achieve a consensus vision for radical change. Similar exercises in Denmark illustrate a complementary dynamic where socioeconomic assessment of the future contribution of district heating concludes that very little change from currently high penetration levels is either necessary or desirable. * Drawing on national approaches to estimating the potential for district heating we have analysed the Scottish Heat Map to understand how the location of potential varies with assumptions, how these locations relate to other Scottish policy objectives (including fuel poverty). a. Our approach has been to estimate the extent of low carbon district heating for a given prevailing heat price using different assumptions about business models. A 'cherry picking' model represents continuation of current UK trend for fragmented, disconnected, project-based development while a 'cross-subsidising' model represents stated policy aspirations for more strategic, interconnected and area-wide development models. The latter would reach approximately 50% more heat demand than the former across a range of reasonable price assumptions, quantifying for the first time the potential impact of a more strategic approach to district heating. b. Areas with high district heating potential are characterised by a high proportion of flats, but neither social housing nor non-gas domestic heating (both advocated in policy debates as targets for heat networks) are particularly concentrated in areas with long-term district heating potential. The spatial distribution of fuel poverty similarly does not pattern with long-term district heating potential. Because areas where long-term district heating potential overlaps with either fuel poverty, non-gas heating or social housing are limited, a policy emphasis on development in these places is likely to perpetuate the fragmented pattern of development and miss economies of scale. 2. Market frameworks and financial appraisal of sustainable heat innovations in UK, Danish and German cities * All case study cities which we studied are working to establish capacities for action on sustainable heat. UK cities are experimenting with municipally owned companies to build capacity. In Aalborg, the municipal approach is channelled through institutionalised structures of ownership (local) and appraisal (national). Hamburg re-municipalisation of heat network infrastructure is regarded as opening up routes to low carbon supply which multinational corporate ownership foreclosed. * Transfer of DH networks to municipal ownership in both Hamburg and Aalborg is associated with debate about potential price rises associated with decarbonisation, though the case for transfer emphasised capacity to keep prices down. One of the key issues about relative prices concerns the counterfactual that is used, and the necessity for a low carbon comparator. * Changes in European and national electricity markets are reshaping the local financial viability of investments in heat supply systems, particularly for combined heat and power. * Civil society groups occupy different positions within city governance institutions, and so play different roles in changing local patterns of heat and energy efficiency. In Germany, citizen-initiative routes to municipal referendums have been critical to cases of energy remunicipalisation. This formal route for activism has, in Hamburg, created means for ongoing participation of civil society groups in debate and governance of the forthcoming repurchase of the district heating scheme. In Danish cities, while some civil society groups campaign on local energy issues their role is more marginal, and local electoral processes are perceived to ensure adequate representation of the interests of citizens in local heat decisions. In the UK civil society groups are marginal, often organising building-specific sustainable heat initiatives (e.g. retrofitting a community building) but struggling to find a role in local energy planning processes. For example, in Glasgow a community group has explored the feasibility of district heating connection for tenement flats to a new waste incinerator, but limited municipal capacity and a fragmented pattern of heat network organisation has prevented these plans being explored as part of a broader comprehensive approach to heat decarbonisation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"56b21382a37425.19167213","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=56b21382a37425.19167213&grantRef=EP%2FM008215%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M008215/1","57C75CE4-BFCB-4FA6-B729-51D895455218","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","00940FDD-EB46-40A9-A955-EAAA61CC3748",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Please see Narrative Impact and section on policy influence","Energy,Environment","https://heatandthecity.org.uk/project/reframing-energy-demand-innovation-for-sustainable-heat/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/M008215/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Social and Political Science","Research Grant","Webb","Janette",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reframing Energy Demand: Innovation for Sustainable Heat","31/12/2014","31/08/2018",580962,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/M008215/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","00940FDD-EB46-40A9-A955-EAAA61CC3748","School of Social and Political Science","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

First, the existence of a support network for small to medium independent music festivals to build capacity in successfully addressing environmental sustainability is crucial. In the case of Scotland, we found through our interviews and focus groups that the lack of a pre-established network hindered the development of a community of practice among music festival organizers to share ideas, skills and expertise concerning environmental sustainability. Festival organizers may wish to improve the sustainability of their event, but many of them, particularly at the grassroots level, are limited by their capacity to resource staff time and additional costs associated with equipment. Both technical expertise required in certain areas (e.g. efficient generator practices, alternative energy supply options) and leverage to bid for low carbon equipment procurement (via collective organization when negotiating with suppliers) are areas for attention. Second, engagement with local authorities and planners (which have historically tended to focus on the noise produced by festivals rather than their environmental impact) could potentially drive action. Scotland has relatively progressive policies on both planning for climate change and reducing waste, and these could be deployed more comprehensively with productive dialogue between organizers and local authorities. Third, there is an important role for the creation and dissemination of music within festival communities that makes audible the tensions between economic or cultural sustainability, and environmental sustainability. Work such as this can mediate complex meanings and engage diverse audiences on an affective level in difficult dialogues. There is excellent potential to expand the work of artist-led creative practice to engage not only musicians themselves but also audiences and organizers - work that could be achieved through our fourth recommendation: to connect the Fields of Green with wider initiatives exploring the relationship of culture and environmental sustainability (in the case of Scotland this would include the culture/SHIFT programme run by Creative Carbon Scotland and the Climate Conversations programme endorsed by Scottish Government, but there are likely to be analogous initiatives in other regions and nations as well). Music festivals, if not fully fledged communities in and of themselves, nevertheless act as hubs to connect otherwise disparate communities, and as such can be used to foreground, link, and progress sustainability-related issues between individuals (artists and audiences), organizations (festival organizers, production suppliers, local authorities), and infrastructure (driven by policymakers and investors). Finally, our research showed that when it comes to music festivals and environmental sustainability, onsite waste - because of its visibility in media and at a festival itself - tends to be a focal point despite the fact that energy and travel are far greater contributors to a festival's overall carbon emissions. More research needs to be conducted in this area, particularly around the issue of encouraging behavioural change in energy use and travel among organizers and suppliers, musicians, and audiences. Work on the role of popular music might serve in addressing issues of climate change inevitably also raises questions pertaining to debates about the intrinsic versus instrumental value of popular music: does such research belong in the field of popular music studies, ecomusicology, or event management? As ever with environmental sustainability research, the case of music festivals illustrates the need for the co-production of research and interdisciplinary approaches to fully understand, and then address, the complexity of the challenges humanity faces in order to move towards an environmentally sustainable culture.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"56ddaef17dfcf8.85526858","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=56ddaef17dfcf8.85526858&grantRef=AH%2FM009270%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/M009270/1","0C0F9236-A8A0-4515-820A-DDD8167299D5","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","F754BF41-54B6-4CA1-AD3E-9B1A73194688",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Our findings may be of use to the music festival sector and live music industry, particularly in Scotland.","Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AHRC","AH/M009270/1","University of Edinburgh","Edinburgh College of Art","Research Grant","Brennan","Matt",NA,"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0308-7300",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fields of Green: Addressing Sustainability and Climate Change through Music Festival Communities","14/04/2015","29/09/2016",45534,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=AH/M009270/1","1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","F754BF41-54B6-4CA1-AD3E-9B1A73194688","Edinburgh College of Art","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

This review was published as a critical review in Environmental Science and Technology (DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.6b01548). o The CO2 stream was sampled from a number of CO2 capture plants using amine capture, gasification, and oxyfuel combustion processes on coal, gas and biomass feedstocks. The inherent tracer fingerprint (carbon and oxygen stable isotopes of the CO2, and concentrations and isotope ratios of trace noble gases - He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) were analysed. o The carbon stable isotope composition (d13C) of the captured CO2 is similar to (&plusmn; 5‰) that of the carbon-rich feedstock. Carbon-isotope fractionation during amine capture remains poorly constrained and the limited results available suggest that isotopic fractionation is very different to that expected from CO2 dissolution into and exsolution from fresh water. o The oxygen stable isotope composition (d18O) of the captured CO2 is similar to that of atmospheric O2 (mostly within &plusmn;10 ‰). For amine capture, the CO2 does not appear to be strongly influenced by the d18O of water used to dilute the amine solution. The controls on d18OCO2 from gasification (steam reforming) are poorly constrained. o A large proportion of atmospheric noble gases are introduced during most CO2 generation processes, and so noble gas isotope ratios in captured CO2 streams are mostly atmospheric, often with evidence of isotopic fractionation of air. o A crustal helium isotopic signature (3He/4He < 1 RA) may be preserved in CO2 streams derived from fossil fuels, but this is not guaranteed. Expected crustal argon-isotope signatures were not observed in fossil-fuel derived CO2, most likely due to the high concentration of Ar in air. o Noble gas concentrations in captured CO2 are generally low, with noble gases being lost during CO2 purification processes. Air-normalised noble gas elemental ratio patterns are different to air saturated water and may exhibit enrichments in Xe. * Our data suggest that transport of the captured CO2 stream between the capture plant and the injection site is unlikely to modify the bulk of the stream, but that fractionation may occur when sampling high-pressure streams. * The inherent fingerprint of the captured CO2 stream will be modified upon injection into the subsurface, where it will mix with pre-existing gases, dissolve and migrate, but these processes can be modelled to infer the fate of the injected CO2. o Captured CO2 was injected into, and subsequently produced from the Otway 2BX storage project. d13C changed slightly but this change can be used, in conjunction with baseline data, to calculate the proportion of CO2 dissolved into the formation waters. The noble gases took on a signature assumed to be that of the local formation fluids. o CO2 sampled from the Aquistore storage site after subsurface migration from the injection to the monitoring well shows an enrichment in crust-derived 4He, indicating that the presence or absence of crustal noble gases can be used to identify the source of CO2 during suspected leaks.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"56ddb0af760259.55865688","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=56ddb0af760259.55865688&grantRef=EP%2FK036033%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K036033/1","7F0D9308-B3EE-45D5-AFCF-1EE714DEAB8D","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","A117F0F0-E2EE-4D31-9C10-6BE4EE8936EA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"* The results of this research can be used to aid in selecting the most appropriate source of CO2 for pilot-scale, proof of concept CO2 storage projects that wish to test the use of inherent CO2 tracers. * This research demonstrates the feasibility of using naturally occurring stable isotopes and noble gases as tracers for subsurface gas storage and will thus feed into future research, monitoring techniques, and policy regarding subsurface gas storage. o This research is likely to encourage the use of stable isotopes as tracers for geological storage of CO2. o Further work researching the behaviour of noble gases inherent to the CO2 stream, once injected, is clearly desirable.

A report prepared based on this work has been shared with a tidal energy developer who are a partner with FloWTurb. A coupled wave and tidal current numerical model has been developed for the Fall of Warness region. The model has been thoroughly calibrated and validated with field measurements collected through FloWturb project partners at the University of Highlands and Islands. The coupled model was found to predict wave-current-turbulence interactions accurately. The results are published in the European Wave and Tidal energy conference in Sept 2017 at Cork, Ireland. Further publications are under preparation for Journals and conferences in 2018. Field measurement campaigns have been undertaken at several sites in the Fall of Warness and Orkney Waters in the past two years using a number of sophisticated acoustic type instruments. The data is currently being analysed. The processed data will be soon made available for the industry and research use. Key outcomes: Workpackage 1 Numerical modelling of wave-current interactions and turbulences: Among the 3 key tasks identified for this work package, the task 1.3 Characterisation of 3D flow turbulence structure, has been continued further even after the end date given in the work plan for the main reason that new site measurements was made available to WP1 by WP3 for the MeyGen site. As this site is exposed to significant wave and tidal current interaction, the modelling tasks were extended to verify the model's capability in modelling combined interaction with reliable field data. Few key publications were produced for this work (see the publications list [1], [10], [11], [17], [18] ) and many more in preparation. This work package is now complete. Work Package 2 Quantification of turbulence in combined wave and current situations in energetic tidal channels through field data acquisition: Initially the wave-tidal data have been acquired for the Fall of Warness site. Additional measurements of waves and tidal currents have been undertaken for five different locations in the Innersound at MeyGen tidal site. Further measurements have been conducted Butt of Lewis and Hoy Mouth Orkney. Thus a huge volume of data gathered have been processed and various parameters quantifying turbulence interactions produced. These are now reported in Journal and conference publications (see [3], [8], [9], [13], [14], [15], [16], [20]). This work package is now complete. Work Package 3 Physical modelling of combined waves and tidal currents and reproduction of flow turbulence characteristics: All individual tasks within this work package have been accomplished. The tests were conducted in the Flowave facility. All experimental data collected have been analysed and used in work package 4. Key results are reported in Journal publications (see [5], [12], [19] , [20]). This work package is complete. Work Package 4 Dynamic loading on scale model tidal turbine rotors in 3D waves, misaligned tidal currents with varying turbulence intensities: For this work package, a 1:15 scale tidal turbine model was used to measured hydrodynamic loads (on the blades, foundation) and performance (thrust and turbine power) in waves and currents have been measured for a wide range of regular waves, random waves, focussed waves, misaligned waves and reproduced waves from site conditions. Waves are selected and programmed specifically to facilitate frequency domain analysis, and techniques are employed to isolate the effect of non-linear waves on turbine power and thrust. Extensive data analysis was conducted and results are reported in several publications (see, [2], [4], [5], [6], [7]). All tasks except one have been completed. Task WP4.4 Fatigue load measurement on the rotor and support structure is planned in March 2019. Work Package 5 Methodology for determining wave-current-turbulence-induced fatigue and dynamic loading on tidal turbines: The tasks within this work package are computationally demanding, but started in September 2018, and on-going. When the fatigue analysis tool is completed it will be in the public domain. 1. Reta, M.G., Venugopal, V., Creech, A., 2019.

Extensively calibrated and validated 3-dimensional numerical models accounting for combined wave-current-turbulence interactions have been produced for FloWTurb to very high standard which no other research achieved in the past for EMEC's Fall of Warness and Meygen tidal sites. The model results demonstrated that the coupled model worked well in predicting wave-current interaction parameters. The models mesh configuration, bathymetry, and various calibration coefficients have been thoroughly inspected and available for researchers for future use in addition to site data. This would save considerable time for those interested in setting up a combined wave-current model for forecasting and hindcasting. The project developed new approaches to exploit FloWave's combined wave-current generating capability at higher flow speeds (those required for scale testing of high flow speed channels) and focused extreme waves. The experiments provided increased general understanding of modelling of wave-current-turbulence environment and using it to measure tidal turbine's performance in a controlled experimental facility. The tests provided in depth assessment of wave-induced loads on a tidal turbine, including, the effect of wave frequency & amplitude, opposing and following wave conditions, effect of wave angle and regular, irregular and additional bespoke sea states. 17 field datasets of waves/tidal currents/combined wave and tidal currents measurements have been obtained between July 2016 to January 2018 for FloWTurb project. Some of these data have been stored on the Edinburgh University Data share facility. Many of these data sets can be made available to interested researchers. Industry partners (MeyGen, Scottrenewables and DPenergy) have provided their feedback and support through attending project management board and steering committee meetings which took place at the interval of 6 months. They found the results and discussions on numerical modelling and field data analysis, in particular turbulence parameters, were useful for their tidal energy projects developments. Meygen used some of the FloWTurb site measurements to validate their energy converters power prediction (see SIMEC Atlantis turbine power curves, https://marineenergy.biz/2018/09/13/simec-atlantis-tidal-turbine-grows-stronger/, for 1.5 MW machine).","Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology","https://www.flowturb.eng.ed.ac.uk/measurement-data-redapt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/N021487/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Research Grant","Venugopal","Vengatesan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"FloWTurb: Response of Tidal Energy Converters to Combined Tidal Flow, Waves, and Turbulence","12/04/2016","31/10/2019",745542,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N021487/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","02F929E9-8466-49E0-8B7D-54F0FB0C9A9F","School of Engineering","College of Science and Engineering"

Whilst the fields of humanitarian aid and development are paying increasing attention to 'modern' technologies that can transform energy access for refugees and internally displaced people, alternative forms of local innovation through which people meet their energy needs in contexts of forced displacement offer important lessons. These may offer the potential for more cost-effective and sustainable approaches. ? Globally, changes in energy provision and services in camps and informal settlements are occurring unevenly - with both 'top down' and 'bottom up' models. The misalignment of these models risks deepening disparities in levels of access to 'cleaner' energy technologies and services. ? Informal markets for the distribution, repair, and charging of energy technologies, devices and systems are a vital part of everyday life in Goudoubo and Kakuma refugee camps. Cash and barter exchanges for fuel, batteries, water coolers, and other energy objects are an important element of refugee and host community livelihoods - and therefore cohesion. ? Poorly thought-out and unregulated market-based approaches to energy risk disrupting existing and often precarious economic ecosystems in these camps. For example, they may displace existing livelihoods and fail to address the break down or deterioration of equipment. ? Current interventions in the field of humanitarian energy rarely take the opportunity to build on the energy access and resilience strategies that people employ before and after they become refugees or internally displaced people. Accounting for people's technical knowledge and existing practices in the design of energy technologies, systems and business models could facilitate more successful uptake. ? The huge need and desire for energy products and services is readily apparent in both camps. It is exemplified by the value that many refugee households attach to energy objects as being essential to their survival and well-being; and sometimes - particularly in the case of batteries and generators - as a status symbol. ? Approaches to humanitarian energy that brand the use of traditional fuels and technologies (such as firewood-burning open cookstoves) as dirty and harmful can cloud understanding of the important social and cultural factors that could foster greater uptake of cleaner energy services. ?

"NERC","NE/I005935/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Wood","Rachel",NA,NA,"Our main finding is that Animals built reefs 550 million years ago. Our Press Release: It is a remarkable survivor of an ancient aquatic world - now a new study sheds light on how one of Earth's oldest reefs was formed. Researchers have discovered that one of these reefs - now located on dry land in Namibia - was built almost 550 million years ago, by the first animals to have hard shells. Scientists say it was at this point that tiny aquatic creatures developed the ability to construct hard protective coats and build reefs to shelter and protect them in an increasingly dangerous world. They were the first animals to build structures similar to non-living reefs, which are created through the natural processes of erosion and sediment deposition. The study reveals that the animals attached themselves to fixed surfaces - and to each other - by producing natural cement composed of calcium carbonate, to form rigid structures. The creatures - known as Cloudina - built reefs in ancient seas that now form part of Namibia. Their fossilised remains are the oldest reefs of their type in the world. Cloudina were tiny, filter-feeding creatures that lived on the seabed during the Ediacaran Period, which ended 541 million years ago. Fossil evidence indicates that animals had soft bodies until the emergence of Cloudina. Findings from the study - led by scientists at the University of Edinburgh - support previous research which suggested that environmental pressures caused species to develop new features and behaviours in order to survive. Researchers say animals may have developed the ability to build reefs to protect themselves against increased threats from predators. Reefs also provided access to nutrient-rich currents at a time when there was growing competition for food and living space. Scientists say the development of hard biological structures - through a process called biomineralisation - sparked a dramatic increase in the biodiversity of marine ecosystems. The study, published in the journal Science, was carried out in collaboration with University College London and the Geological Survey of Namibia. Professor Rachel Wood, Professor of Carbonate GeoScience at the University of Edinburgh, who led the study, said: Modern reefs are major centres of biodiversity with sophisticated ecosystems. Animals like corals build reefs to defend against predators and competitors. We have found that animals were building reefs even before the evolution of complex animal life, suggesting that there must have been selective pressures in the Precambrian Period that we have yet to understand.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"544f8eaf7e9269.92604252","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=544f8eaf7e9269.92604252&grantRef=NE%2FI005935%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/I005935/1","2A9ECD78-BAD7-4CDA-AE65-DC7B0B017308","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","246A8E80-BC1F-416C-98F5-03B9BE2B8E6E",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"We are still writing up the research - more publications in the pipeline!","Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/I005935/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Wood","Rachel","Alison",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Re-inventing the planet: the Neoproterozoic revolution in oxygenation, biogeochemistry and biological complexity","01/11/2010","31/10/2014",17223,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/I005935/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","246A8E80-BC1F-416C-98F5-03B9BE2B8E6E","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

"NERC","NE/I025840/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Sugden","David",NA,NA,"Blue-ice moraines in the Ellsworth Mountains are equilibrium forms reflecting the interplay between glacier flow and ablation (loss of ice by sublimation). Study of their evolution over time suggests the main West Antarctic Ice Sheet divide survived intact for over 1.4 million years, ie throughout the warmest Pleistocene interglacials. The result provides an insight into the behaviour of the ice sheet during climates warmer than present and is consistent with two possibilities. The first possibility is that the whole West Antarctic Ice Sheet survived intact and is perhaps a less serious risk in a warming world. The second and more likely possibility, because it is supported by biological and sea-level evidence, is that a regional ice sheet survived on the the Ellsworth-Whitworth mountain upland, whilst the marine component of the ice sheet disappeared, at least during the warmest interglacials. In the latter case glaciological modelling shows that sea level rise was around 3 m above present. The implication for the future is that a warmer world is likely to undermine the the ice sheet and could contribute to sea-level rise of around 3 m in a matter of centuries. We have also established that the Weddell Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) behaves differently from the melting Pacific-facing sector.

Linear Vernier Hybrid Machines - Newcastle designed and built prototype machines using this promising machine topology, which has inherent magnetic gearing. Topologies proposed overcame the previously reported low power factor, increasing their promise for renewable and other applications. A power converter was designed and built to demonstrate a prototype linear generator with a controller to show that resonant phase control with an all electric power take off can be achieved. The system was demonstrated at small scale using a scale model of a buoy in the FloWave test facility at the University of Edinburgh. 2. Magnetic Gear Systems for Electric Power Take Off - Edinburgh showed how magnetic gear systems could be deployed to increase the low speed of wave energy converters typically 1 rpm, up to 10s of rpm. Design and modelling tools have been developed allowing rapid design. As part of the modelling it was shown that magnetic gears are capable of slipping in extreme waves, which provides inherent load shedding capability improving power take off reliability and survivability. A small scale prototype magnetic gear was designed, built and tested to verify the modelling. A magnetic gear was installed on a small scale model of an oscillating surge converter similar to the Oyster device, and successfully demonstrated in the FloWave test facility at University of Edinburgh. Both aspects of the project required modelling of wave energy converters in order to investigate power take off performance within the complete system, which led to the development of an opensource modelling tool, Edinburgh Wave Energy Systems Toolbox, which is currently being maintained by ReOptimise Systems Ltd. Based on the results of each aspect of the project further funding has been obtained.

The ethical foundations of international conservation, including conservation's relationship with poverty, are currently being interrogated in animated debates about the future of conservation. However, while some commentary exists, empirical analysis of conservation practitioner perspectives on poverty, and their ethical justification, has been lacking thus far. We used Q methodology complemented by more detailed qualitative analysis to examine empirically perspectives on poverty and conservation within the conservation movement, and compare these empirical discourses to positions within the literature. We sampled conservation practitioners in western headquartered organizations, and in Bolivia, China, Nepal and Uganda, thereby giving indications of these perspectives in Latin America, Asia and Africa. While there are some elements of consensus, for instance the principle that the poor should not shoulder the costs of conserving a global public good, the three elicited discourses diverge in a number of ways. Anthropocentrism and ecocentrism differentiate the perspectives, but beyond this, there are two distinct framings of poverty which conservation practitioners variously adhere to. The first prioritizes welfare, needs and sufficientarianism, and is more strongly associated with the China, Nepal and Uganda case studies. The second framing of poverty focuses much more on the need for 'do no harm' principles and safeguards, and follows an internationalized human rights-oriented discourse. There are also important distinctions between discourses about whether poverty is characterized as a driver of degradation, or more emphasis is placed on overconsumption and affluence in perpetuating conservation threats. This dimension particularly illuminates shifts in thinking in the 30 or so years since the Brundtland report, and reflecting new global realities. This analysis serves to update, parse and clarify differing perspectives on poverty within the conservation, and broader environmental movement, to illuminate consensual aspects between perspectives, and reveal where critical differences remain.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"56d4831d781371.97914924","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=56d4831d781371.97914924&grantRef=NE%2FM007103%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/M007103/1","2D2A777F-B288-4A1B-867C-99144BB3D7AC","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","7764E7F7-0E36-4396-AF4C-2E1A420F8C2F",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Further work with the discourses we identify.","Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/M007103/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Fisher","Janet",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Why should ecosystem services be used for poverty alleviation?

It has become the location for many of our values-based disagreements. Should the areas be re-wilded? Should we plant more commercial forests? Should we stop eating meat? All of these provide challenges to existing patterns of working and living in uplands. We found some shared features among the case study areas, with multiple and interacting stressors e.g. remoteness, limited infrastructure such as broadband, and weather challenges. But each case study area also has unique features in the combination of land ownership (e.g. large estates, tenanted farms, crofting), local tradition, culture and history, and the suitability for alternative land uses (e.g. forestry, energy generation, shooting or protected land). The meaning of resilience for each case study could be very different: what is being maintained and whose resilience is the focus? There is no shared vision for what people want from the uplands (landscapes, tourism, agriculture, forestry, rewilding, carbon sinks, energy production). Yet all of these interact with each other. But the people living in these area are important, and depopulation, and an ageing population, is a serious challenge. The centralisation of many services to call centres increases efficiency but the resulting fewer local jobs reduces resilience. New entrants to farming/crofting struggle to access affordable land and capital. Incomers need to demonstrate commitment to the area. Uplands are well-positioned to offer solutions to emerging societal demands and delivering public goods, but are severely constrained compared to lowlands, heavily dependent on subsidies and the 'efficient' global production model does not fit these areas very well. A survey of a sample of farms using the Public Goods Tool, developed by the Organic Research Centre, provided evidence of upland farms contributing positively to soil management, fertiliser management, food security, agri-environmental management, and particularly animal welfare and health. However, these data represent only a small number of farms, and the specific measures within the Tool, and may not fully reflect the upland situation. Farm Business survey data suggest there is considerable diversity in economic viability and vulnerability among the Scottish upland farms. However, those that are vulnerable, tend to remain vulnerable, and those that are robust, tend to remain robust, with little change in resilience over time. Economic modelling suggests that future climate change may substantially increase the economic consequences of liver fluke. Upland farms have limited capacity to raise beef cattle and sheep to slaughter weight and so most are sold in the autumn as young animals ('stores'). The result is lack of information flow between consumers and producers. Consistency of supply (size, shape, fat cover, eating quality) is critical to retailers, butchers and hotels, but is difficult to maintain from the uplands where numbers are small, seasonality affects availability of grass-fed animals, and a wide-range of different breeds are maintained. Agriculture in in remote areas relies on social networks to remain resilient. Strong ties with the community of farmers together with bridging ties to external networks enables openness to new ideas as well as the ability to work together. A study of Orkney found that there is considerable shared activity, with important social networks developed at school maintained in later life, and with the livestock mart forming a key centre for networking. Ensuring resilience of agricultural and food systems in remote areas requires paying attention to where and how social networks are formed, maintained and function, including the impact of policy areas other than agriculture, such as decisions around school catchment areas and maintenance of transport infrastructure. Producing food in upland areas does not easily secure resilience in food supply for locals. Citizens in these remote, rural areas, mainly purchase food from supermarket chains, allied to global supply chains. Because they are at the extreme end of supply chains, they are vulnerable to perturbations in the system. Where local food is available, it tends to be an expensive, premium product, often aimed at tourists.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a9d158d6f6253.04110701","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=5a9d158d6f6253.04110701&grantRef=BB%2FR005796%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/R005796/1","AFFDA2C6-C89C-47A9-9048-5005B53135B2","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","5E9B5D29-CF31-4456-9CC7-237E5E39FE40",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The work is still ongoing.","Agriculture, Food and Drink","http://upland-resilience.org/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BB/R005796/1","University of Edinburgh","Science  Technology & Innovation Studies","Research Grant","Bruce","Ann",NA,"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5812-5605",NA,NA,NA,NA,"The role of livestock in food system resilience in remote, upland regions","05/03/2018","29/09/2022",399169,NA,"Scotland","Active","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/R005796/1","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","5E9B5D29-CF31-4456-9CC7-237E5E39FE40","School of Social and Political Science","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

This value of this hydrological ecosystem service is not fully understood by competing land users and is currently at risk from partially informed land use change decisions. Existing valuation approaches are largely based on a neo classical economic valuation approach to derive monetary values for environmental goods and services. This monetary valuation metric presents problems in certain low income contexts where existing non-monetary value systems are already mediating exchange of market and non market goods and services. This research has conceptualised alternative valuation approaches including value elicitation from key stakeholders near our case study areas. Since early 2020 we have been considering the most novel valuation approach to water valuation in the paramo (or more precisely the welfare effects of changes to water availability). The estimation of the welfare effects associated with changes in Paramo land covers -- for these changes are indicative of competing conservation practices -- was approached as an econometric problem. The water value meta-analysis structured around it suggests that water production in the Paramo cannot be conceptualised as an (economic) production function, requiring instead Machine Learning heuristics to link water discharge rates to available irrigation water. Our demand-side estimations show that a 10% increase in the area of cultivated land, within the Paramo buffer zone, implies an average 1.15% reduction in the economic surplus of local water abstractor groups -- bearing a yearly cost of approximately &pound;11,638,400 (across relevant municipalities). * A full manuscript on the meta-analysis of water values is available: delays caused by disruptions in data collection and reduced collaboration with partners prompted new research challenges -- the creation of a new methodological framework, the processing of secondary datasets, and the engagement with new local stakeholders. * We are finalising the NLP analysis of the Agrosolidaria workshop: unanticipated research opportunity within UoE to apply precursory research findings to a specific COVID challenge. * We are working on a joint piece on value with Bristol: delays caused by the asynchronous impacts of the pandemic on distinct research teams. * We are involved in the Brujula project to disseminate the PeP results: delays in the overall PeP research process have truncated a more timely dissemination of more varied and voluminous outcomes. * We are looking at an agent-based exercise to model distinct conservation scenarios using raster data to inform biophysical predictions -- asked Kris (Kings) if of interest but have not heard from him yet, and we are using the PI's raster data for illustration (hope a PeP colleague could circulate their own).

Pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) technologies have been considered as an energy efficient alternative to the conventional amine-based absorption processes. At the heart of the PSA process is adsorbate material. It has been proposed that promising materials for carbon capture must exist among tens of thousands of already synthesized and potentially millions of hypothetical MOFs and ZIFs. Computational screening strategies have been employed to identify these materials, with more recent studies based on realistic process simulations. It is now recognized that the optimal performance of a material, and hence its ranking, is not a function of its intrinsic adsorptive properties only, but also depends on other variables such as how the material is structured within the adsorption column and characteristics of the cycle. In this project we combined molecular simulations with advanced process modelling to explore performance of materials in real dynamic PSA cycles. Overall, our findings can be summarized as follows: 1 Equilibrium adsorption characteristics are not on their own sufficient to predict the behaviour of the material in a real process simulation. This behaviour also depends on other factors such as pellet size, configuration of the size etc which can be optimized for each individual material specifically. 2 We discovered several characteristics and metrics of the optimal process configurations that are material-independent and can be used to expedite the computational screening methods in a search for the most optimal materials for carbon capture and other applications. These key findings have been presented in several articles associated with the project. The most recent article has been published in a prestigious journal of Energy and Environmental Science. 1.

Currently the focus has mainly been on cementitious materials since concrete is by far the most used construction material. At the building level (1), this project has improved understanding of how environmental impacts can be mitigated via technology, socioeconomic factors, and policy. We have found that the material composition (also known as material intensity) of buildings is a key factor influencing their embodied environmental impacts, more so than other factors such as building type and socioeconomic effects like the gross value added of the construction sector. Therefore, changing material compositions of buildings and infrastructure, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with materials production, is key to mitigating climate change impacts in construction. Here, the role of policy is to accelerate these changes, meaning it should be designed to support material substitutions in construction products. At the material level (2), for modern concrete, we have found that most emissions arise from cement production (~60%). Cement can be carbon negative if produced from different raw materials to those currently used (particularly magnesium silicates rather than limestone), although this technology requires substantial further research. We expect uptake of such alternative cementitious material technologies can be accelerated by production of concrete components in 'precast' or 'off-site' manufacturing plants, since here specification focusses on components rather than materials and this manufacturing process intrinsically supports more efficient matching of materials to products. It is thus important to introduce and strengthen policy that supports this shift in manufacturing from on-site to off-site in construction. More research and policy support is also needed to promote carbonation and higher value utilisation of end-of-life concrete, since this has potentially high emissions mitigation but is relatively poorly understood. Extending this analysis to other materials is ongoing. Creating the proposed material flow impact assessment algorithm has proven to be challenging due significantly to the paucity of material composition (intensity) data for UK buildings and the myriad of materials available for substitution. As noted above, we have found that material composition is the most important factor influencing the embodied environmental impacts of UK buildings, hence obtaining these data is a key research need.

These risks are related to repeated flash-flooding events that occur 2-3 times per year in the affected neighbourhoods, which have increased in frequency due to climate change driving more intense rainfall. In particular, the collaboration between the University of Edinburgh / Heriot-Watt University and the National Polytechnical Institute of Mexico has produced and is currently piloting a new mobile application (COLMENHA, for Collaborative Management for Emergencies and Natural Hazards Adaptation) aimed at facilitating the implementation of flooding risk reduction measures and strategies in the affected neighbourhoods. The mobile app is being co-developed through an ongoing iterative process in collaboration between communities, government and academic institutions. To this aim, the initial stages of this research focused on working with two vulnerable neighbourhoods, La Colmena-Ermita Zaragoza, located in one of the most deprived sectors of the city, the Iztapalapa municipality, and El Pe&ntilde;on, which is located in the Venustiano Carranza municipality. The action-research process enabled the academic team to engage with the communities living in La Colmena and El Pe&ntilde;on to gain an understanding of the specific impacts and risks associated with the increase of intense rainfall, along with community needs in relation with risk management in the periods before, during, and after a flooding event. In parallel, interviews and focus groups were conducted with key government institutions that are developing policy and actions to tackle these risks, in order to ensure that the strategies identified at the neighbourhood scale can inform the development of wider city-scale strategies. Through this work, the project co-produced a series of so-called 'smart-city' solutions that are socially acceptable and appropriate to meet community needs in the different moments of the flooding risk cycle: these smart solutions are now being piloted through the use of a single mobile application developed by the research team in 5 target neighbourhoods, as described above. Importantly, risk management and resilience, as well as smart solutions, are all current government priorities, which is a critical advantage for this project in terms of achieving impact. Overall the project has led to the following findings: -New knowledge of community perceptions of hydro-meteorological risks at the local, neighbourhood level in Mexico City; -New knowledge of government institution perceptions of risk and risk management strategies to be implemented during this presidential term, which are relevant to the aims of the project and have the potential to lead to tangible impact through the ongoing co-creation and smart solution piloting process, as the findings can inform policy development; -Interactions across the research team have led to a rich academic exchange among academic groups with diverse disciplinary backgrounds, engineering, sociology, architecture, data science, etc., and are leading to innovative methodologies and approaches to research development.

This mobile application has the potential to be transferred and adapted for the specific needs of other vulnerable communities in Mexico City or elsewhere in the Global South, in collaboration with the relevant local authorities. The project methodologies, findings, and outputs, including the mobile application, will be shared with local Mexico City risk management institutions at an upcoming online 2-day knowledge exchange event on March 31-April 1st, titled Co-producing urban resilience to climate change: Innovation for integrated risk management. The event will also feature invited speakers from UK and international academic institutions, and will be disseminated widely via social media. Furthermore, the collaborative work identified priorities among a range of public sector and community organisations within Mexico City. As the strategic approach continues to develop through the pilot studies currently underway, this experience will form the basis for the implementation of similar strategies elsewhere in the city and internationally, with significant impact expected at the local neighbourhood level, through increasing the resilience of those directly exposed to hydro-meteorological risks by facilitating more integrated risk management. The project team has worked in the past three years within an extensive network in the cities in the Global South (e.g., Medellin, Sao Paulo and Puebla) and the findings from this research will be shared across these academic and non-academic communities. In Mexico City, careful targeting of key organisations and understanding of their priorities, as well as opportunities for collaboration, has led the process throughout. In addition, the project team (Mexico-UK) is continuing to conduct meetings, interviews and workshops with key government institutions driving policy aimed at increasing resilience and adaptation capacity in Mexico city, and has established avenues for collaboration in which the findings of the project are informing future directions in policy development and decision-making.

It also defines the role of microbiomes in farmed animals, including as an intermediate phenotype underlying heritable traits. 2.1.1. GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL OF TEMPERAMENT: In collaboration with SRUC, we used social network analysis to show that the benefits of play fighting were limited to specific social contexts and were not predictive of injuries sustained by littermates due to aggression in later life. We also found that interactions between aggressiveness and the experience of winning or losing contests did not influence contest behaviour. In collaboration with SRUC we have developed new methodological approaches to study the social structure underlying acute and chronic aggression in pigs (https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/37000). Applying social network analysis (SNA) to behavioural data, we identified group level and indirect behaviour that are involved in post-mixing aggression that were previously undetectable by the traditional study of dyadic traits only. Networks containing large fully connected subgroups had fewer injuries at stable social conditions, whereas highly divided networks had considerably higher injuries. We identified network structures associated with poor hierarchy formation, which are essential for maintaining long-term social stability in commercial pig units and established the role of individuals' position on an individual's own injury levels and that of others. We also determined that play fighting social networks do not predict injuries from aggression at stable social conditions using the same methodological tools. We have also developed statistical models to determine the extent contest behaviour is influenced by an individuals' aggressiveness compared to previous aggressive experience. Using on-farm data, we found that aggressiveness does not compromise the ability of pigs to learn from past contest experience and that reducing aggressiveness is unlikely to affect how animals experience loosing and winning. Subsequent genetic analyses of the newly derived social network behavioural traits is ongoing and will determine appropriate breeding strategies for animal welfare. Together these studies have important welfare implications for managing aggression in pigs. We have exploited our ability to access temperament phenotype data for large cohorts of dogs. Comprehensive analyses of genetic and non-genetic factors associated with behavioural characteristics in these animals have identified welfare-related behavioural traits showing moderate heritability as well as QTL associated with these traits. We have also identified genomic signatures of selection that may be associated with behavioural traits. We identified behavioural changes indicative of pain in finisher pigs with gastro-oesophageal ulcers, which are common in pigs fed fine-ground diets to increase efficiency. We showed that different mechanisms exist by which metabolic stress versus social information influence stress axis activity in birds. We have significantly advanced understanding of how play and environmental enrichment affect the welfare of pigs and have collaborated with colleagues at Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) to identify animal genotypes that differ in temperament, providing potential markers for selection to improve welfare. We used video imaging of social interactions to examine the impact of environmental enrichment (EE) on pig welfare and showed that locomotor play is a sensitive welfare indicator that can be measured automatically. Play behaviour differed between litters, developmental stages (weaning) and when piglets were raised in a free-farrowing system. Social network analysis also identified behaviours that predict chronic aggression upon mixing of neonatal pigs. Based on these findings, we have engaged industry stakeholders to implement remote image analysis and promote EE in commercial pig production. In response to environmental enrichment, we established that insulin-like growth factor 1 is markedly upregulated in the brain of neonatal pigs, and have since applied RNA sequencing to detect changes in gene expression in the frontal cortex linked to active behaviours stimulated by EE, including in genes involved in synaptic transmission and microglia. We captured the perspective of pig farmers on measures of positive welfare and contributed a critical review of the literature on positive animal welfare. We also advanced understanding of play behaviour in calves by demonstrating a contagion effect, and by validating accelerometers as a means to record spontaneous locomotor play. Contrary to our expectations, we found that when high milk allowance calves were housed with calves receiving a low milk allowance, play in the high allowance calves was suppressed. This work is the first to suggest a negative contagion effect in play behaviour and the study was able to quantify the sensitivity of play to disease and other challenges. To support experimental studies on positive welfare we have contributed to a substantial review on the neuroscience of positive emotions across animals and humans. We have also published a review of animal welfare in the context of economics and policy, which clearly identifies the valuation of animal welfare in economic terms as a major knowledge gap. Building on evidence that laboratory rats emit ultrasonic vocalisations associated with a positive emotional state when a human hand imitates young rat play (tickling), ISP-supported work showed how the protocol could be adapted to address differences between individual animals. NC3Rs uplift funding was awarded to extend our finding of individual differences in response to playful handling. We also established that tickling only affects solitary and not social play, and showed that rats learn to associate neutral odours with tickling, thereby offering scope for odour conditioning. 2.1.2. UNDERSTANDING THE REGULATION OF APPETITE IN POULTRY: Appetite is closely regulated by the nervous and endocrine systems and these are vulnerable to stress. We used unique ISP-funded capability in avian electrophysiology to determine how appetite and neural feeding circuits develop. This primed uplift funding to study neural feeding circuits in newly hatched chicks and to determine states of hunger and stress. Broiler chickens are feed-restricted to control health issues but show behavioural signs of hunger. Solutions have been difficult to find and there is a need to understand some of the unique aspects of avian food intake. We have made significant progress in further characterising the circuits involved in controlling food intake in the chicken. To understand the basis of satiety and energy homeostasis in broilers, we analysed cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin (GAST) and their receptor transcripts and found that while CCK expression does not respond to acute satiety state, GAST is upregulated under short-term fasting. This confirmed some of the details on the expression of these genes along the gastrointestinal tract, but also highlighted some interesting new information. In particular, CCKAR expression in the crop was unexpected, supporting a role of CCK in mediating crop emptying. This could open ways of understanding how control of the flow of food to the gastrointestinal tract is regulated. We also analysed the expression of PP-fold peptides in chickens and showed that pancreatic polypeptide is the primary peripheral short-term satiety hormone whereas peptide YY is dependent on longer-term energy state. We found sex differences in anorectic and orexigenic gene expression under feed restriction. In an effort to understand the control of food intake, we have increased the evidence that there is a strong and potentially causal relationship between the expression of AGRP in the brain and the growth potential of a chicken. We have carried out sex reversal experiments that demonstrated clear phenotypic effects on traits known to be sex-steroid-dependent, such as adult bone strength. However, it did not affect the sexual dimorphism of expression of AGRP in the hypothalamus, suggesting that the sex difference is due to genetic sex and not the hormonal milieu of the animal. The sex difference observations have been extended down the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by measuring GH and TSHb expression, both of which showed strong sexual dimorphism. The AGRP neurone may be an important component in the genetic mechanism by which a set point for growth rate and ultimately body weight may be determined. Although the genetic effect may not be directly on the AGRP gene, but rather on the inputs that determine its expression and these can be modified by environment as well as genetics. A significant poultry welfare issue is that day-old male chicks are culled as only female birds lay eggs. One proposed solution to this problem is to skew the sexual development of chickens to increase the proportion of female birds. Our important findings show that simple gonadal sex reversal of male chickens will not overcome the egg production welfare problem. Using our unique genome editing technology, we have discovered that the DMRT1 gene is the key sex determination factor in birds. It has been suggested that manipulating DMRT1 could skew sex ratios, however, in birds there is strong evidence for cell-autonomous sex identity. In contrast to mammals, individual cells 'know' which sex they are as the sexual phenotype is directly determined by the sex chromosome content of individual cells in different tissues. 2.1.3. SEASONAL BREEDING & MATERNAL BEHAVIOUR: The circannual rhythm is naturally synchronised to the annual cycle by photoperiod to drive growth, reproduction and metabolic traits in farmed animals. Via ISP and uplift funding, we have uncovered the molecular mechanisms by which the circannual rhythm in sheep is encoded and have shown that genome-wide changes in DNA methylation mark the seasonal rhythmicity in the pars tuberalis brain region. Seasonal genetic changes are triggered by photoperiodic changes and these involve a key clock gene, BMAL2. Our landmark findings may explain the evolution of seasonal timing in animals as the function of BMAL2 is likely to be conserved across vertebrates. The photoperiodic response is an important commercial trait in poultry and, via ISP and Leverhulme Trust investment; we have investigated mechanisms and functional roles of deep brain photoreceptors. We discovered that deep brain non-ocular photoreceptors maintain gonadal function in ducks, and elucidated the first steps in the neuroendocrine mechanism transducing photoperiodic information to the chicken reproductive system. ISP pump-priming funds were invested to use editing and optogenetic approaches to define the role of specific photoreceptors in the photoperiodic response. Utilizing recent developments in viral vector technology, we have silenced Opn5 and VA-opsin expression in the medial basal hypothalamus of Japanese quail prior to photostimulation. Our data suggest that both Opn5 and VA-opsin photoreceptors play a key role in the activation of the reproductive axis in response to photostimulation. At the interface with ISP1, we produced a high-quality reference genome for Japanese quail and revealed key photoperiodic mechanisms by investigating photoperiod and temperature interactions on the hypothalamic transcriptome. We have also elucidated mechanisms of photoperiodic and environmental regulation of seasonal breeding in wild birds, and provided new information regarding avian stress axis regulation in relation to gene-environment interactions. This helped to leverage BBSRC uplift funding to better understand the resilience of migratory birds to global climate change, including by comprehensive genomic analyses during annual breeding cycles at the interface with ISP1. We have also demonstrated dynamic changes in the nonapeptide and gonadotrophin-inhibiting hormone systems in the chicken brain that are associated with incubation and broodiness behaviours. 2.2. IMPACT OF EARLY LIFE EXPERIENCE: In relation to the basis of intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) in pigs, we found links between porcine foetal size and sex with endometrial angiogenesis and integrin expression at the foetal-maternal interface, extending earlier work on the role of placental angiogenesis and apoptosis in the same animals. Impaired reproductive performance of growth-restricted pigs was found to be programmed during gestation. We have shown that KLB, a co-receptor for FGF21, plays a key role in mediating the adaptive response of skeletal muscle to FGR in pigs. Our data indicates that KLB activation in growth-restricted foetuses contributes to reduced muscle development and a higher predisposition to adipose accumulation later in life. These findings pave the way to using FGF21 as a therapeutic target to ameliorate the effects of IUGR in pigs, and potentially humans. With pump-priming funds at the interface with ISP1, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were used to detect differences in the transcriptome and chromatin states of large and small littermates, and dysregulation of the fibroblast growth factor 21 co-receptor ßKlotho was implicated in reduced muscle development during IUGR. We established a cell culture system that faithfully recapitulates the reduced muscle/increased adiposity phenotype in FGR littermates and identified genome-wide transcriptome changes. Mesenchymal stem cell cultures were found to recapitulate differentiation phenotypes seen in IUGR littermates, providing a tractable 3Rs model to test hypotheses. Using a pig model, we have shown that IUGR programmes fetal mesenchymal stem cell fate towards the fibro-adipogenic lineage at the expense of the osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. This explains the tendency of IUGR individuals to show restricted growth and accumulate fat after birth. We also assessed 306 plasma miRNAs as biomarkers of functional traits in dairy cattle across age and genetic backgrounds, and identified several miRNAs expressed in early life to be useful indicators of fertility, lameness and mastitis. We have showed how prenatal stress affects the neuroactive steroid responses to acute stress in adult life in rats, and showed how maternal antioxidant treatment can prevent the adverse effects of prenatal stress on the brain and behaviour of offspring. We discovered that corticotrophin-releasing factor receptors modulating maternal behaviour and anxiety are suppressed in rats during lactation, opening the possibility of therapies for stress-induced maternal neglect. We demonstrated sex and regional differences in the generation of neuroactive steroids in the brain following acute stress suggesting that differential neurosteroidogenesis may contribute to sex differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to stress. We also defined trans-generational effects of maternal dietary supplementation with the methyl-donor betaine on first generation development, behaviour and stress responses of quail, and studied the impact of in ovo stress. 2.3. HOST-MICROBIOME INTERACTIONS UNDERLYING FARM ANIMAL PRODUCTIVITY AND HEALTH. Significant advances in understanding of the rumen microbiome and it role in feed efficiency, methane emission and other heritable traits were made. Rumen digestion of plant-derived complex polysaccharides is reliant on rumen microbiota and is vital for energy retention but also linked to greenhouse gas emission. Building on our assembly of 913 novel microbial genomes from rumen metagenome data, and computational tools for such, we published 4,941 metagenome-assembled microbial genomes from rumen microbiota, and have since assembled a compendium of 33,813 such genomes. This vastly increases the number of metagenome sequence reads that can now be aligned to known organisms and provides a valuable resource to mine for enzymes of industrial value. Moreover, we assembled 1,200 novel genomes from the rumen of indigenous African cattle thereby identifying signatures associated with sub-optimal feeding, and extended the approach to other ruminants. We extended our work on metagenome signatures as an intermediate phenotype underlying heritable differences in methane emission, by showing that interactions between rumen microbial communities contribute to methane production, rather than it simply being due to the abundance of methanogenic archea. Further work in collaboration with SRUC has identified microbial genes associated with appetite and growth in beef cattle, as well as between animals exhibiting heritable differences in feed conversion efficiency. We also examined the impact of varying forage-to-concentrate ratio in the diet of beef cattle and impact of using nitrate or oil-based supplements in the rumen microbiome. In dairy cattle, we identified microbes, genes and pathways associated with low and high milk fatty acid profiles, paving the way for rationally selected probiotics. We are developing low-cost metagenomic techniques and cloud-based bioinformatic workflows to capture microbiomes as an intermediate phenotype in heritable traits to inform breeding decisions. We have also performed metagenomic analysis of the cow, sheep, reindeer and red deer rumen to other publically available microbial genomes and discovered novel species. We also found significant differences in terms of the abundance of microbial taxonomies, carbohydrate-active enzyme genes and KEGG orthologs. Linked to this work, we released MAGpy, an open source pipeline for the analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes, PULpy, a pipeline utilised for the prediction of PUL clusters in metagenomic datasets, and poRe tools for processing MinION data. Profound differences between the microbiomes of low- and high-methane emitting ruminants were identified, extending our earlier work on metagenome signatures as an intermediate phenotype in this heritable trait. Our goal is to apply these approaches to other farm animals to improve the classification of metagenome sequence reads and identify microbiome or metagenome signatures associated with production-relevant traits. In collaboration with The Quadram Institute, we analysed metagenome data to assemble the genomes of thousands of novel microbes from the chicken caecum and identified differences in the abundance of microbes and carbohydrate-active enzymes specific to diet and breed, thereby providing options for dietary additives to promote energy retention and gut health. The cecal microbiota plays numerous roles in chicken health and nutrition. Where such microbiota differs between lines exhibiting distinct phenotypes. Our work suggests that stable transplantation of the cecal microbiota between lines is achievable and offers scope to dissect the role of gut microbial communities in those traits. We defined differences in microbiota composition and richness from different locations in the chicken gut. Our finding that microbiota from young animals can reverse age-related decline in the function of microfold cells, has primed work to explore how rationally selected microbes could support mucosal immune function in farmed animals. Ongoing industry-linked work is revealing associations between gut microbiota and broiler chicken phenotypes, including gut health and growth promoted by in-feed antibiotics. Using rodent models, we found that transfer of gut microbiota from young mice to aged mice increased the abundance and function of the M cells so the immune responses of aged mice were more effective. We are now investigating if this also applies in farmed animal species and whether it underlies age-related changes in immune function in humans. We developed a non-invasive method to obtain respiratory microbiome data using sheep exhaled breath condensate. In contrast to humans, we found that the lower respiratory tract microbiota of lambs is dissimilar to that of the upper aerodigestive tract, informing ongoing research to understand seasonal outbreaks of ruminant respiratory disease. In chickens, we discovered age and location specific differences in the respiratory tract microbiome.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a9e87d77f0434.45820566","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=5a9e87d77f0434.45820566&grantRef=BBS%2FE%2FD%2F30002276","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BBS/E/D/30002276","D92A28B0-AA70-46E3-8CFD-60E4DF99BB87","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","FDA986DE-FF42-437E-B7FF-278A2CE210EC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"he strategic aim of ISP3 is to enhance the yield and quality of animals or their products while improving welfare and efficiency. Theme 2 aims to specifically investigate complex phenotypes and genotype x environment interactions by: (1) Defining and optimising the impact of environment on behaviour and welfare, (2) Defining the impact of early life experiences on reproductive efficiency and attributes of offspring and (3) Defining host-microbiome interactions underlying farm animal productivity and health. The programme will examine complex phenotypes and how genotype-by-environment interactions influence animal development, physiology and performance. We will examine the impact of genetic and environmental factors on animal behaviour and welfare, including how experience during gestation or early life affect reproductive efficiency and shape the attributes of offspring. We will also examine the extent to which host genetics influence indigenous microbial communities, and dissect the role of microbiota in animal health and disease. Key beneficiaries include: (1) Academia, via knowledge of animal models of behaviour (e.g. temperament, maternal and seasonal behaviour), reproductive fitness, offspring attributes and appetite. Dissection of the underlying mechanisms of such behaviours addresses BBSRC priorities in Bioscience for Health, animal welfare and understanding genotype-by-environment interactions. Proposed studies on the microbiota are relevant to work in wider academia in relation to gut health and will harness our ability to link host genetics with the abundance of microbes and genes in metagenomes, as well as our capacity to establish causality by transfer of microbiota in animal models. (2) The ISP will be a valuable platform to train early-career researchers and visitors in vulnerable skills, including via the provision of taught and research-intensive degrees, workshops and knowledge exchange. (3) Farming, breeding sectors and commercial partners will benefit from data to improve animal productivity and welfare, including through selective breeding and gene editing and from improved understanding of how animals of varying genotype perform in different environments. Studies on the impact of husbandry practices and stressors on development and lifelong health of farmed animals and their offspring have the potential to enhance the lives of managed animals and address societal concerns related to the welfare of intensively reared livestock. Emphasis will be placed on species and traits where significant potential exists to improve efficiency reduce waste and enhance lives. (4) The national economy and public will benefit via increased yield, quality and efficiency in the agriculture and aquaculture sectors, which already contribute c. &pound;11Bn gross value added/per annum and support c. 400k jobs. (5) Low- and middle-income countries will benefit as indigenous breeds have been subject to limited genetic improvement. The ISP, together with the Centre for Tropical Livestock Genetics & Health, will develop tools for neglected breeds of importance to developing countries and transfer knowledge and data on the genetic architecture of relevant traits to unlock their genetic potential. We will also consolidate our growing strength in genetic resources for aquaculture, which now contributes over half the world's food fish. (6) Policymakers will benefit from continued dialogue with ISP-funded researchers about food security and the future of farming, particularly with regard to the relative contributions of conventional selection and genome editing, as well as the societal, ethical and regulatory issues they present. The impact of husbandry practices and knowledge of their effects on farmed animals and their offspring have the potential to change farming practice and be rapidly implemented. (7) The programme addresses all six priorities of the BBSRC Agriculture & Food Security framework for 2016-2021 and it will deliver Bioscience for Health priorities related to lifelong health and welfare of managed animals. It occupies a distinctive niche within the National Institutes of Bioscience and provides vital tools, expertise and knowledge for our programmes on Blueprints for Healthy Animals (ISP1) and Control of Infectious Diseases (ISP2).","Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other","https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/research/isp/improving-animal-production-welfare",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BBS/E/D/30002276","University of Edinburgh","The Roslin Institute","Intramural","Meddle","Simone",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Complex phenotypes and genotype x environment interactions","31/03/2017","30/03/2020",NA,4575693,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BBS/E/D/30002276","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","FDA986DE-FF42-437E-B7FF-278A2CE210EC","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Science","College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine"

"NERC","NE/J019720/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Patenaude","Genevieve",NA,NA,"Forests cover approximately 30 percent of the world's land area, yet they are being lost at a rate equivalent to one football pitch every three seconds. Long-term financial investment is needed to maintain these forested areas, yet forest carbon-related investments are often perceived as risky, as they suffer from permanence risk due to losses resulting from natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Improved information on risks of forest loss is needed to reduce the uncertainty around such investment. Davies, Patenaude and Locatelli, in collaboration with Forest Research, conducted research to understand how existing tools can help financial institutions assess forest exposure to natural disturbances risks. This was conducted alongside a project aiming to quantify those risks, including one project that looks at wind risk. We pull trees down and measure how resistant they are to this. We then use modelling to look at this resistance across different species, forest stands and management practices. The research, featured as part of BBC Four's programme Oak Tree: Nature's Greatest Survivor, is feeding directly into new tools and products developed and used by some of the private sector. Methodology and model to assess pest and disease risk to UK forest carbon projects were also developed. Notably, the UK Woodland Carbon Code is the standard for forest carbon projects in the UK. The code supports the creation of new woodlands to sequester carbon for the voluntary carbon markets. It was launched in 2011 to increase private investment in woodland creation, and to ensure a high standard of UK woodlands where carbon sequestration is robustly audited and verified. As of 30 Sept 2015, there were 102 validated projects encompassing 3,421 hectares of woodland, with another 106 projects (12,196 ha) awaiting validation. As part of the application process, each project must assess risk of woodland loss due to natural disturbances (e.g. pests and disease) and anthropogenic factors (e.g. legal/social). Once this risk is assessed, a percentage of the woodland must be set aside to buffer potential losses. Traditionally, historical data have been used to conduct these risk assessments. When it comes to pests and disease however, historical data do not account for the expansion of pests and diseases into new ranges, changes in emergence patterns due to climate change, or newly introduced species. Also, existing data provide information on how damaging a pest or disease is to a tree species, but there is no single indicator that assesses the combined aggregated risks of pests and disease for tree species. Research in collaboration with the Forestry Commission and led by Davies has produced a methodology and model to better assess pest and disease risk to UK forest carbon projects. The findings highlight how risk assessments for carbon projects need to consider longer time scales (in the region of 100 years) and define risk differently from timber or health. It was demonstrated through a case study of the Woodland Carbon Code and a sample of pest and diseases. For example, pests and diseases that change the aesthetic (and therefore value) of the wood are a risk to the timber industry, but as the tree doesn't die, aren't viewed as a risk for carbon projects. The model developed incorporates key information usually missing from pest risk assessments, including percentage likelihood of arrival and establishment, rate of spread, and percentage mortality. This has led to further funding from NERC to work with other collaborators, including ForestRe - an insurer specialising in insurance and reinsurance products for forestry and tree crops globally - and the Forestry Commission to understand what likely effect climate change induced drought will have on tree mortality and to expand the existing pest and disease work for new audiences and forest types.

"NERC","NE/K015249/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Nienow","Peter",NA,NA,"Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers may be sensitive to variation in the availability of oceanic heat, but the fjord processes controlling the delivery of this heat to the glacier termini remain poorly constrained. We have used MITgcm and IcePlume (Cowton et al., 2015) to model Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord, east Greenland, to examine controls on the exchange of water between the fjord and shelf. We have found that intermediary circulation resulting from fluctuations in the depth of isopycnals on the shelf (as generated by coastal winds) can replace up to ~ 25 % of the fjord volume with water from the shelf in < 10 days. This exchange is however limited to the outer reaches of the fjord, and does not transport water from the shelf to the fjord head on seasonal timescales. We have found that buoyancy-driven circulation, forced by the input of subglacial runoff from marine-terminating glaciers, results in an exchange rate between fjord and shelf ~ 10-100x greater than the runoff input. Although the intermediary circulation can generate higher peak exchange rates between the fjord and shelf, the buoyancy-driven circulation is more consistent over time and so more effective at drawing water from the shelf to the fjord head, which occurs on sub-seasonal timescales. This suggests that an increase in shelf water temperatures and more vigorous buoyancy-driven circulation (due to higher ice sheet surface melt rates) caused the mean rate of heat delivery to Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier to increase by ~ 50 % between 1993-2001 and 2002-2011, broadly coincident with the onset of rapid terminus retreat at this glacier. Previous work as part of NE/K014609/1 (Slater et al., 2015) has shown that the spatial pattern and magnitude of submarine ice melt depends on the distribution of ice sheet runoff at marine-terminating glacier grounding lines. However, we know very little about the near-terminus subglacial hydrology that controls this. Theoretical plume models can be used to determine the discharge rate required for a single plume to reach the fjord surface given a certain water depth and fjord stratification. If we know the water depth, stratification and total glacier runoff, we can use time-lapse imagery of plume visibility to constrain the number of channels out of which the ice sheet runoff is emerging. For example, if the runoff from a single channel required for a plume to reach the surface is 30 m3s-1, and the total glacier runoff is 100 m3s-1, but we see no plume at the fjord surface, we can infer there must be more than three channels. Using this idea, and time-lapse imagery from Kangiata Nunata Sermia (a large marine-terminating glacier in south west Greenland) we have shown that the near-terminus subglacial drainage system is only channelized for a limited time around the peak melt period. For the rest of the time, the lack of visible plumes suggests that the distribution of runoff at the grounding line is more distributed. This has implications both for the magnitude and spatial pattern of submarine melt rate (Slater et al. 2015) as well as the relationship between ice surface melt and ice motion. This work is currently being prepared as a paper (Slater et al., in prep). We have used IcePlume (Cowton et al., 2015) and MITgcm to simulate the effect on nutrients and primary productivity (PP) of changes in subglacial injection of freshwater into an idealised Greenlandic fjord. We have found that increased subglacial runoff substantially enhances fjord and coastal PP because the resulting buoyant plumes entrain deep nutrient-rich waters and bring them into the photic zone (rather like classic wind-driven coastal upwelling). This leads to a late summer/early autumn spike in productivity (in addition to the typical spring 'bloom' related to light availability) that has been observed at the mouth of Godthabsfjord in south west Greenland and is evident in remotely sensed (MODIS AQUA) ocean colour data. This work was presented at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting and is currently being prepared as a paper (Sole et al., in prep). UPDATE March 2017 The research for this grant uses the widely used Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm) to model ice ocean interactions in glacial fjords. 1. MITgcm is used to simulate the upwelling driven by the injection into a fjord of meltwater draining from beneath a marine-terminating (tidewater) glacier. While it is known that this upwelling can stimulate enhanced melting of the submerged glacier front, there has as yet been little consideration of how this process might be influenced by the spatial distribution of meltwater emerging at the glacier grounding line. We find that the distribution of meltwater input from the glacier exerts an important control on submarine melting; under certain conditions a spatially distributed subglacial drainage system can induce an order of magnitude more melt than a system in which meltwater is concentrated into discrete subglacial channels. Furthermore, plumes emerging from a single channel are unable, in isolation, to drive large melt volumes even at high discharges, while even small discharges from a distributed system can induce substantial melt. Our results highlight the need to constrain near-terminus subglacial hydrology at tidewater glaciers if we are to represent ocean forcing accurately. This work has been published: Slater, D. A., P. W. Nienow, T. R. Cowton, D. N. Goldberg, and A. J. Sole (2015), Effect of near-terminus subglacial hydrology on tidewater glacier submarine melt rates, Geophysical Research Letters, 42, doi:10.1002/2014GL062494 2. We have developed IcePlume: a sub grid-scale buoyant plume parameterisation for the MITgcm. This development enables three-dimensional simulation of large (>500 km2) glacial fjords on annual to decadal timescales. Previously this was computationally impractical because it was necessary to incorporate both the fine scale, highly non-hydrostatic dynamics of the turbulent glacial outflow plume as well as the wider circulation of fjords that may be hundreds of square kilometres in area. IcePlume is detailed in a manuscript which has now been published: T. Cowton, D. A. Slater, A. J. Sole, D. N. Goldberg, and P. W. Nienow (2015) Modeling the impact of glacial runoff on fjord circulation and submarine melt rate using a new subgrid-scale parameterization for glacial plumes. Journal of Geophysical Research Oceans, 120, doi:10.1002/2014JC010324. Initial results from this work show that for an idealised fjord of typical Greenlandic dimensions (without shelf-driven circulation), subglacial runoff produces a thin, strong and warm down-fjord current in the upper part of the water column, balanced by a thick and slow up-fjord current at greater depth. Submarine melt rates increase with runoff due to higher melt rates where the plume is in contact with the ice front. Annual submarine melt rate across the whole ice front is however relatively insensitive to variability in annual runoff, indicating that atmospheric warming may be of secondary importance to oceanic warming with respect to the stability of Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers. 3. We have also obtained 17 years of 1/4o ocean reanalysed ocean data from Mercator Ocean http://www.mercator-ocean.fr/eng for the ocean surrounding Greenland. This product will be used to characterise forcing for longer duration simulations of actual Greenlandic fjords using MITgcm with IcePlume. 4. Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers may be sensitive to variation in the availability of oceanic heat, but the fjord processes controlling the delivery of this heat to the glacier termini remain poorly constrained.

Spatially distributed runoff at the grounding line of a large Greenlandic tidewater glacier inferred from plume modelling. Journal of Glaciology, 1-15. doi:10.1017/jog.2016.139 6.

This work was presented at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting and is currently being prepared as a paper (Sole et al., in prep). 7. Submarine ice melt induced by buoyant glacial plumes is often assumed to scale with subglacial runoff discharge into the plume to the power of 1/3. Using buoyant plume theory, we have shown that for buoyant plumes of either line of point source geometry, this relationship holds as long as the discharge remains below a critical value. Above this value, the relationship changes, but melt rates can nevertheless be estimated as a function of discharge, fjord temperature, and calving front height. In linearly stratified fjords, a good approximation of many fjords in Greenland, the exponent increases to &frac34; for a point source plume, and 2/3 for a line source plume. This work is published in: Slater, D., D. Goldberg, P. Nienow and T. Cowton (2016), Scalings for submarine melting at tidewater glaciers from buoyant plume theory, J. Phys. Oceanography, doi: 10.1175/JPO-D-15-0132.1 8. We have used plume theory to derive a relationship between glacier runoff, calving front depth and up-fjord volume flux which results from the buoyancy-driven circulation set up by plumes at the glacier calving front. Combined with knowledge of shelf ocean temperatures, this volume flux can be converted into an ocean heat flux. We have shown that over a 20 year period at 10 tidewater glacier-fjord systems along Greenland's east coast, variations in the magnitude of this heat flux can explain 70 % of the variability in tidewater glacier front positions. Our findings indicate that despite the complexity of tidewater glacier behaviour, over multi-year time scales a significant proportion of terminus position change can be explained as a simple function of key environmental variables.

This takes some time as conflicts with other modules must be identified and solved. In the meantime, several MITgcm developers/users are utilising IcePlume. For example Dustin Carroll (University of Oregon), Neil Fraser (SAMS). We expect this tool to be used extensively by glaciologists and oceanographers interested in ice-ocean interactions, particularly in Greenland, Alaska and Arctic Canada. This will lead both to developments of the parameterisation and its incorporation into larger-scale models which seek to simulate the future mass balance (and thus sea level contribution) of glaciers and ice sheets. Results from the near-terminus hydrology work highlight the need to constrain near-terminus subglacial hydrology at tidewater glaciers if we are to simulate ocean forcing accurately. This novel finding will likely encourage glacial hydrologists and oceanographers alike to improve the representation of these processes in ice sheet and ice-ocean interaction models.

However, few attempts have been made to measure and model food system resilience to a range of global shocks. The RUGS project used stakeholder engagement and a novel land use modelling approach to identify trade-offs in managing resilience of the UK food system to disruptions in the global agricultural system, under a range of policy regimes. Raising subsidies or trade barriers for UK production was found to have benefits for price stability and profitability, but these policy regimes are associated with a higher environmental footprint for the average UK diet. This suggests that maintaining easy and low-cost access to global agricultural markets whilst providing environmentally-targeted support to UK production sectors may lead to increased resilience for UK household food security, and the economic viability of UK farm businesses. Our results emphasize the fragility of the food system and the need for food policy decisions to consider trade-offs between multiple objectives. The methodological approach has potential for assessing food system vulnerabilities globally. Additionally, we found that diets lower in meat could reduce agricultural expansion and intensification thereby reducing biodiversity impacts. However, land use requirements, associated with alternate diets, in biodiverse regions across different taxa are not fully understood. We use a spatially explicit global food and land system model to address this gap. The project quantified land-use change in locations important for biodiversity across taxa and find diets low in animal products reduce agricultural expansion and intensity in regions with high biodiversity. Reducing ruminant meat consumption alone however was not sufficient to reduce fertiliser and irrigation application in biodiverse locations.

The project entitled, Future Reliable Renewable Energy Conversion Systems and Networks has the acronym FRENS. Offshore renewable energy systems operate in a harsh environment difficult to access, and so component reliability is important. The electrical generator is a key component, but when it fails the system suffers from long downtime, because of the time required to remove and replace, which is also dependent upon the weather. Within the generator the bearings and winding insulation tend to be the main sub-components to fail. In this project we focused specifically on the insulation system. Insulation failure occurs because of the generator operates at too high a temperature, or due to thermal cycling. In order to investigate this a detailed electromagnetic-thermal model of the generator was developed, and linked to an insulation lifetime model, which uses temperature and electrical stresses as the input. The generator model was linked to a model of an oscillating water column wave device, so that typical and extreme operating conditions could be simulated to investigate the temperature distribution in the generator and ultimately the impact in insulation lifetime. If the generator is operating at too high a temperature because the renewable energy input is too high, then this can have a significant impact on the insulation life. Initial results from the work has shown that by controlling the power flow in the generator the temperature will be reduced and could double the expected lifetime of the insulation. Power management control linked to the thermal performance of the machine and component lifetime models will increase availability of the complete system. If such control is linked to operation and maintenance schedules then the generator can continue to produce power albeit at lower output until a suitable weather window is available for component replacement.

Three main areas have been important in this regard: 1) The research program has highlighted challenges facing small-scale miners in meeting regulatory and legal requirements in order to legalise their livelihoods. Also, the findings have highlighted key advocacy processes initiated by small-scale miners associations in efforts to lobby for national reforms. Furthermore, the findings have highlighted key gaps and opportunities in terms of strategies for implementing the Minamata Convention on Mercury; my research has fed into one of the main national association of small-scale miners' efforts to build capacity in the government to better integrate social and economic understandings of small-scale mining into national strategies for pollution phase-out. Additionally, the research has highlighted the importance of migration (including temporary migration) and mobility as a livelihood strategy for people in precarious economic circumstances and the importance of traditional governance systems in accessing land and resource access and livelihood opportunities. 2) The research programme has also highlighted social, wellbeing and economic challenges facing communities experiencing the impacts of large-scale mining, including displacement and various other impacts. Moreover, the findings have highlighted the creativity of people in expressing their daily struggles and their community identities and needs, and various different gendered dimensions of current challenges. The work has helped to deepen understandings of the ways in which creative methods can be used to build collective solidarity and develop strategies for helping to address major challenges, communicating with different stakeholders in the community contexts themselves as well as beyond. 3) Following Cyclone Idai - which struck Chimanimani in March 2019, the research programme focused on recovery challenges after this disaster, which significantly exacerbated existing struggles and mapped onto complex histories dynamics of marginalisation and land alienation. Populations in the Chimanimani mountains along the Zimbabwe-Mozambique border - the focus in this project - were among the most severely affected by Cyclone Idai. The project's final (2019-2020) year was dedicated to working with 5 impacted communities, using arts-based methods, focus groups, and ethnographic techniques examining social, economic, environmental and cultural issues surrounding efforts to rebuild food security, health and social capital. Findings stressed 1) severe gaps in donor- and policy- responses on food security (prioritising short-term food aid - with inadequate attention to Indigenous food systems and basic water/irrigation infrastructure support); 2) diverse epistemologies surrounding creative approaches, through storytelling linked to map-drawing, photovoice, and community drama to express collective planning aspirations; and 3) the significance of rigorous gender-based analysis and intergenerational knowledge in mobilising to re-establish healthy communities. The outcomes included sharing knowledge with district officials that led to two important water systems in two different communities where this project worked -- showing the ESRC projects can achieve hugely important impacts in addressing water challenges when the research adapts through creative methods in the field; the discussions also highlighted the needs for far more robust long-term activities to address social challenges tied to long-term recovery. Very importantly, this award created a baseline of detailed knowledge of community challenges in Chimanimani leading up to the 2020 period, including major climate shocks and other economic and political shocks, and our team has also been involved in 2020-2021 in following up the ongoing changes to community challenges during the COVID19 pandemic.

There are further meetings that are planned in the years ahead - to link government actors, small-scale miners, and others, as users of the research. The findings have also highlighted key needs for follow-up in regards to supporting communities affected by large-scale mining and ways of addressing socially and economically marginalised communities in Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs). The research offers insights on methods and focus points for using research to improve social services and access to key amenities of life in communities dealing with challenges of land alienation, extraction and livelihood insecurity.

A number of key themes have emerged from this debate and reflection, namely the multiple ways in which development and community forestry professionals come to understand what 'equity' and 'social inclusion' entail in reality. This understanding not only reflects professional and disciplinary knowledge and training, but also importantly their own identity (including for example as from an urban middle-class) and their personal experiences and observations based on experiences of family, friends and wider society. When it comes to intervening through community forestry initiatives to promote equity and social inclusion, the knowledge and understanding that professionals have is very much constrained however by development practices and procedures, for example funding mechanisms, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks, and seniority and power within and between organisations. These structural constraints limit the potential of many interventions to meaningfully transform social relations and norms in order to actually deliver equity and social inclusion. In other words, the 'paradox of participation' - in that interventions (inadvertently) result in elite capture of benefits from participation and thus further disempower already marginalised groups (such as women, men and women of so-called lower castes, and those who are the poorest within communities) - reflects development practices and procedures which fail to fully account for what 'equity' and 'social inclusion' really mean in practice and what they require in interventions. 2019: This award has so far resulted in 5 publications, including 1 journal article and 4 international conference presentations. A journal article reporting specifically on the findings of this award is in preparation and due to be submitted in the next month to a well-respected international journal. Another journal article (written for a well-respected Nepali journal) will emerge in due course from the final part of the award's activities - see below. As the final part to this award I will be facilitating a workshop over the summer of 2019 in which I hope to engage with 'GESI Officers' i.e. those people within development organisations now tasked with promoting GESI - Gender Equality and Social Inclusion. GESI Officers are now a feature of development and community forestry organisations and institutions across Nepal, and working with them to reflect on how understandings of equity and social inclusion influence their work and how structures and wider social norms constrain their own ability to enable GESI, will get to the heart of what can be done to transform 'the paradox of participation'. This award has resulted in collaborations with Nepali institutions both with regards postgraduate teaching opportunities (in the form of an annual 'summer school' for University of Edinburgh Masters students in Nepal, and in the form of collaboration on a PhD studentship supervised by the award holder) and on applications for further GCRF funding opportunities (namely the ESRC GCRF Equitable Resilience call). Within the UK the award has resulted in the establishment of a growing network of academics and development practitioners based in and around Edinburgh through the 'Edinburgh Environment & Development Network' (EEDN). The network has resulted in healthy discussion, debate and sharing of experience and expertise between those working in the broad field of environment and development and has served as a bridge between the sometimes siloed fields of academia and practice. This has resulted in collaborations between academics and practitioners on funding proposals and the personal relationships and trust being built will provide a sound basis for longer-term engagements hopefully far into the future. The objectives of the award have largely been met, or will be met through on-going work and engagements in Nepal planned for a little later this year (contributing to the 'user impacts' the award aimed to create), and through final submission of publications in preparation (contributing to the 'academic impacts' the award aimed to create). The delay in fulfilling objectives have been partly due to the award holder securing a permanent academic post (and with that teaching responsibilities), which in itself was an objective of the award (the 'career impact' the award aimed to create). This permanent post will enable the award holder however to continue their engagements in Nepal, both through postgraduate teaching and through further research and funding bids (examples given above).

Workshop involved 25 participants from development and environment sector, from government, donor agencies, grassroots movements. This was the start of a follow-on action research project and since there has been a follow-up meeting in Kathmandu without PI, but COVID-19 restrictions have now come into force so we wait to see the best way forwards as the PI can no longer travel to Nepal in April 2020 for the third follow-up meeting. 2.

"NERC","NE/F021399/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Nienow","Peter",NA,NA,"Main Achievements and Outcomes Between May 2009 and May 2011, we obtained ice motion and surface melt data from GPS sensors located along two ~100 km transects at the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet on both land-terminating (Leverett) and tidewater (Kangiata Nunata Sermia - KNS) glacier margins. We also collected data of the hydrological characteristics of the proglacial runoff draining from the land-terminating margin (discharge, e.c. and turbidity). Our research has shown that across a large land-terminating drainage catchment within the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), there is a seasonal upglacier expansion and increase in hydraulic efficiency of the subglacial drainage system, across a catchment >600 km2, to distances >50 km from the ice-sheet margin. This expansion occurs episodically in response to the drainage of surface meltwaters into a hitherto inefficient subglacial drainage system as new input locations become active progressively further upglacier (Objective 2); this system is similar to that observed at Alpine glaciers. These observations provide the first synopsis of seasonal hydrological behaviour in the ablation zone of the GrIS (Bartholomew et al, 2011, GRL). The observations of efficient meltwater routing at the glacier are also The effect of this meltwater penetration to the ice sheet bed is to perturb the subglacial hydrology at the ice-bed interface causing the ice sheet to flow faster in summer. Our sensors reveal substantial increases in summer motion, of up to 250%, compared with winter background. These motion variations display an upglacier evolution over the course of the summer, with initial velocity enhancement occurring earliest at sites close to the ice margin (Objective 1). The pattern of ice motion and hydrological characteristics of the proglacial runoff in the land-terminating margin confirms that the seasonal evolution in the subglacial drainage system controls basal sliding through hydraulic-ice dynamic forcing mechanisms comparable to those observed at smaller valley glaciers (Bartholomew at al, 2010, Nature Geoscience). Our findings show that the relationship between melt and ice motion varies both at-a-site and between sites during the melt season. At our land terminating transect, we find a strong positive correlation between rates of annual ablation and changes in summer ice motion (Objective 3), with sites nearest the ice sheet margin experiencing greater summer acceleration in ice motion (15-18%) than those above 1000 m elevation (3-8%) (Bartholomew et al, 2011, EPSL). At our tidewater glacier transect, we find that >35 km from the ice-margin, seasonal and shorter-time scale ice flow variations are controlled by surface melt-induced changes in subglacial hydrology but the net effect of the summer speed variations on annual motion is small (~1%) (Sole et al, 2011, JGR) (Objective 4). The observations of efficient meltwater routing at the glacier bed have profound implications for ice-sheet erosion. Through the collection of sediment flux data (proglacial discharge and suspended sediment concentration) at our land-terminating catchment, we estimate erosion under the catchment occurs at ~4.8 &plusmn; 2.6 mm a-1 which is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude greater than previous estimates of erosion rate beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our results suggest that where surface meltwaters are able to access the bed, the rate of erosion by ice sheets is in keeping with the rapid erosion observed at temperate alpine glaciers (Cowton et al, 2012, Geology). Significance Our findings are significant because they provide a conceptual framework to understand the impact of hydrologically-forced velocity variations on the future mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. In particular, the data generated which shows the relationship between the volume of meltwater input at the glacier surface and the magnitude of the dynamic response has now been provided to the ice sheet modelling community, through the EU funded Ice2Sea consortium. The data is being used to improve parameterisations of a sliding law which is being incorporated into a suite of models which will be incorporated into the IPCC 5th report for estimating the contribution from Greenland to sea level rise in a warming world. All of our original objectives have been achieved (and are referred to above at the most relevant point) and the key findings have been incorporated in the already published peer review journal articles also referred to above (their full details are provided in the JeS publications summary). One of our publications (Tedstone et al, PNAS 2013) showed that despite record summer melting over the Greenland Ice Sheet in 2012, the subsequent reduced winter ice motion resulted in 6% less net annual ice motion in 2012 than in 2009 (an 'average' melt year). Our findings suggest that surface melt-induced acceleration of land-terminating regions of the ice sheet will remain insignificant even under extreme melting scenarios.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"546487dc88ede6.74428621","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=546487dc88ede6.74428621&grantRef=NE%2FF021399%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/F021399/1","74441150-94A6-4CBD-90C7-DDA4A46B0632","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","15A3ADAD-7A7E-4D6F-B087-25991DFD93E0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"This work was taken forward and applied to remotely sensed satellite data. A paper, published in Nature by Tedstone et al in 2015 revealed that despite warming, landsat data revealed decadal slowdowns across the Greenland Ice Sheet. Tedstone's (PhD student) paper in Nature reveals that parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet are less vulnerable to climate warming than previously thought. A contentious issue, and one with implications for ice sheet stability and sea level rise, has been whether or not an increase in meltwater, in response to climate warming, will accelerate the movement of ice sheets, driving more ice toward the continental margin where it can melt or calve into the ocean. Until now, the link between melt and ice motion has remained equivocal in large part due to the short length of the ice velocity time-series. Using three decades of Landsat imagery for a 170-km land-terminating stretch of the western Greenland Ice Sheet margin, Andrew and colleagues found that more meltwater does not equate to faster ice sheet motion. Rather, despite a 50% increase in surface melting, ice motion decreased in their 8000km2 study region by about 12%. The study, published in Nature, was carried out in collaboration with the Universit&eacute; Savoie Mont-Blanc in France and the University of Sheffield. Essential to the success of the work was the team in Edinburgh GeoSciences which brought together expertise in remote sensing (Noel Gourmelen who developed the novel technique to exploit the Landsat archive on a previous project) and ice-sheet modelling (Dan Goldberg) to support the previous field based work of Pete Nienow and Andrew Tedstone. The team still have a lot more to do to understand the movement of the sections of the ice sheet which terminate in the ocean, and which have seen acceleration in recent decades.

The work has also examined how the wakes of tidal turbines deployed in farms interact with each other and has provided insight into how the turbines in arrays can be controlled to maximise the power production from the array. Design tools to assist with the optimal design of wave energy converters and both bed mounted and floating tidal energy converters that account for the stochastic nature of both the waves and turbulence in the marine environment were developed over the course of the project.

"EPSRC","EP/P007805/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Wallace","Robin",NA,NA,"The EPSRC Centre for Advanced Materials for Renewable Energy Generation (CAMREG) brought together two leading universities to conduct collaborative research in novel, smart and multifunctional materials for renewable energy conversion and storage. Led by Edinburgh and supported by Strathclyde University, the aim of the &pound;2.5M Centre was to combine activity, know-how and facilities from across a wide range of existing fundamental and applied materials science capacity to address the known and emerging challenges in renewable energy generation and storage. Work was split into three themes: Theme 1: Multifunctional materials for energy applications Theme 2: Materials for energy conversion and storage Theme 3: Smart materials for energy applications 12 Keystone Projects and 13 further projects funded through our Flexible Fund were carried out under these themes. Highlights of our findings include the following: - We investigated the use of luminescent coatings as means of optical measurement of mechanical strain. An important application area of this new technology is use as an in-situ non-destructive optical measuring sensor in moving components such as wind and tidal turbine blades. - We developed new fatigue resisting materials for tidal, wave and wind turbine systems. The novel manufacturing strategy is based on a toughened powder epoxy gradient, which improves the erosion resistance properties without compromising the fatigue performance of the structures. - We developed new anti-biofouling and self-monitoring coatings for offshore energy conversion systems based on electro chlorination in order to protect large exposed surfaces immersed in seawater. The chlorine species obtained via this method are quickly degraded, while a low concentration only (0.5ppm) is required for active protection on a targeted surface. This concentration is harmless for humans as it is the same chlorine concentration present in treated water for consumption purposes. - We developed novel ways to manipulate light and enhance PV generation. Luminescent downshifting polymeric films with embedded emissive molecules were used to enhance the quantum yield of Silicon, CIGS and CdTe solar cells at short wavelength. New methods for printing luminescent polymer/dye layers onto PV modules were developed, allowing a post-manufacturing process to enhance appearance and performance of the device, consistent with stability requirements of outdoor use. - We developed smart morphing aero- and hydro-dynamic working surfaces with enhanced durability for use with wind and tidal turbines. This technology deals with one of the main causes of failures of the blades, the unsteady loads that are due to both the environmental flow (turbulence, shear in the onset flow velocity profile, etc.) and to the rotation of the rotor. - We designed 3D printing processes for silicone membranes as a novel manufacturing process for Dielectric Elastomer Wave Energy Generators. The 3D printing process is scalable and automatised and allows for optimisation of the desired features of the membrane structure. For the first time 3D printing was applied to produce large silicone membranes with optimised properties to be used in DEG devices. - We developed a new class of adaptable free-standing hydroxide-ion exchange membranes for alkaline fuel cells. Our technology has the potential to render the ion exchange step unnecessary, which is currently carried out by the addition of NaOH, which in turn makes the system less stable in atmospheric conditions on account of the reaction between the hydroxide ions and carbon dioxide. - We developed a novel thin-film solar cell architecture for improved device performance. We fabricated thin emitter layers with a lowered barrier height for electron transport via thermionic emission, resulting in more efficient PV cells.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a82f0c4be2e06.46246128","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=5a82f0c4be2e06.46246128&grantRef=EP%2FP007805%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/P007805/1","69969E2A-0B77-4FAD-B6DE-8BAB56FB7789","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","9CC11928-89DC-43D7-878F-CA93578BDFEA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"By design, all keystone and flex-funded projects had industrial input and/or collaboration.

"NERC","NE/H000038/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Biological Sciences","Stone","Graham","http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2737-696X",NA,"First, we established that tree phenotypic traits including budburst, leaf retention times, and forestry-relevant growth measures are indeed locally adapted, and differ between trees from different origins more than expected simply by genetic drift. Phenology and growth form selection regimes are well predicted by climates at the provenance origin, as used in climate matching models. However, growth patterns are better predicted by models including geographic gradients in both latitude and longitude. Having developed the statistical methods, we are now collaborating with colleagues at INRA on a larger scale analysis including multiple INRA trials with the same provenances, so allowing quantification of any gene by environment interactions in the tree phenotypes.We amassed a unique dataset on herbivore abundance data across 20 provenances chosen to span observed diversity in phenotypic parameters. In surveys we searched 62,400 shoots for herbivores resulting in 133,590 records. Most comprise 3 feeding guilds: 60,820 gallers, 16,738 leaf-mining moths and beetles, and 16,738 external feeding caterpillars. Our choice of resolution of insect taxa has been guided by DNA barcoding of 4500 specimens of leaf miners and external feeders, covering >80% of the observed morpho-species. This approach has both linked previously unmatched lifecycle stages, and corrected errors morphology-based identification in multiple guilds. Publications to date primarily concern methods and the initial molecular explorations of insect diversity. While draft versions exist for the publications listed above as in prep, the statistical analyses will continue for a short while. Multivariate analyses suggest that tree provenance is a strong predictor of the community structure of associated herbivores. Even models incorporating only variables used in climate matching reveal strong correlations, consistent with the idea that herbivores respond to the traits shown in our prior analyses to be influenced by local adaptation of oak provenances. Ongoing analyses will establish how individual insect species respond to tree phenotypic differences. So far, phenology variables have consistently influenced herbivore abundance although, intriguingly, not always in a consistent direction. This suggests that predictions for significant species, such as pests or keystone drivers of biodiversity, will require targeted studies, using the statistical tools developed here. Further, simple geographic distance is not a good predictor for phenotypic differences between tree provenances or for impacts on herbivore communities. Differences in tree selection regime perform better but have to be considerable to cause large effects on associated herbivores. This means that if provenances for climate matching were sourced from sites 2&deg; south of target introduction sites (as recommended in IPCC low emission scenario for climate matching by Broadmeadow et al. 2005), then they would be unlikely to have a major impact on native herbivore communities. In contrast, introductions from 10&deg; south of introduction sites (as recommended for IPCC high emission scenarios) would probably have a major impact.

Our experiments and modelling results are the first to show differences in C partitioning between arctic moss species in situ. We highlight the importance of modelling C dynamics of moss separately from vascular plants for a realistic representation of vegetation in arctic C models (Street et al. 2012). Continuous time-series estimates of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) are routinely made using a technique called eddy covariance. Process models are used for making predictions of NEE, and can be compared against data to determine their validity. Our model predicts NEE based only on leaf area, irradiance, and temperature and has been well corroborated for all the major vegetation types in the Low Arctic using chamber-based data. This is the first application of the model to eddy covariance data. The model effectively tracked with independent observations. We were able to improve the model by increasing leaf area over the study period, consistent with expected changes. However, we also found the model was improved by including diurnal changes in leaf area, which are not consistent with observations. It is likely that an effect of atmospheric humidity on photosynthesis, which is not included in the simple model, was the cause of this mismatch. Soil organic matter is a vast store of carbon, with a critical role in the global carbon cycle. Despite its importance, the dynamics of soil organic carbon decomposition, under the impact of climate change or changing litter inputs, are poorly understood. We have shown how different assumptions about how soil C is decomposed generate models consistent with observations. However, these models react very differently to changes in litter inputs to soils, or to changes in climate.

This nexus of expertise created a unique environment to evolve new theory and conceptual thinking. The duration and scale of the project allowed us to develop and apply interdisciplinary tools to many related questions in parallel. This configuration supported rapid application of new methods, and durable conversion of groups to Systems Biology. Direct outputs (17 modelling/theory papers, 8 experimental, 6 reviews, 31 total, 6 pending), reflect the successful embedding of modellers with experimental researchers in the project, well-supported by theoretical co-Investigators. The key project developments were are follows: Robustness vs sensitivity to temperature. ROBuST developed a powerful theoretical framework in which to analyse temperature regulation and temperature effects at the systems level. This has allowed us to ask new and better questions and to optimise the design of experimental studies to answer them. An important element was the development of new theory (Domijan and Rand, Interface Focus 2011) that: i) showed robustness and sensitivity to external temperature is an emergent property of clock architecture, and ii) derived a theoretical framework to understand the novel finding that light controls thermal buffering of the circadian clock (Gould et al. Mol Syst. Biol. 2013). A parallel study elucidated the molecular basis of light (cry1) temperature shielding (Foreman et al. Plant J. 2011). Through mathematical modelling we have uncovered a temperature-sensitive switch that has a profound impact on light controlled growth (Johansson et al. Nat. Commun. 2014). We believe that the production of this framework and the consequent application to biological questions is an exemplar paradigm for the systems biology approach. Linking the clock to whole plant responses. An important advance was the development of predictive external coincidence models that link the core oscillator to physiological responses. For instance, Song et al. Science 2012 validated the major prediction of the earlier ROBuST-related publication Salazar et al. (2010) by identifying two mechanisms through which the clock gene FKF1 controls flowering. This analysis predicted novel temperature-activated mechanisms and highlighted the coherent feed-forward motif as a generalised mechanism for external coincidence. Subsequent models analysed the role of temperature in photoperiodic growth and flowering (Seaton et al. Mol Syst Biol. in revision). This analysis has highlighted the coherent feed-forward motif as a generalised mechanism for external coincidence; and predicted novel temperature-activated mechanisms. Arabidopsis transcriptomic responses to ambient temperature. Applying a base analogue labelling method allowed us to directly measure the synthesis and degradation rates of the transcriptome at different ambient temperatures (Sidaway-Lee et al. Genome Biol. 2014). Our data provides the first overview in Arabidopsis of how passive and active changes contribute to the dynamic equilibrium underlying mRNA transcript abundance. Importantly, the study demonstrated that for temperature-responsive transcripts, increasing temperature raises transcript abundance primarily by promoting faster transcription relative to decay, suggesting a global transcriptional process exists that controls mRNA abundance by temperature. Digital Arabidopsis. A major development on the project has been a multi-scale visual digital-plant model that simulates growth and development under different environmental conditions, incorporating information at the molecular, physiological and ecosystem levels (Chew et al. PNAS 2014). The Framework Model, that scales from molecular signalling to carbon resource management and whole plant physiology, belongs to a new generation of composite models that help identify the underlying processes that alter whole organism responses. Such models have wide-ranging applications from molecular pharming to crop improvement. Resource provision Biological Data Repository (BioDare) (www.biodare.ed.ac.uk) is an online facility developed on ROBuST to share, store, analyse and disseminate time series data, with browser and web service interfaces. Toolbox features allow analysis of rhythmic parameters in time series data sets, using six analysis algorithms including ROBuST's Spectrum Resampling (see below; Zielinski et al., PLoS One 2014). Detailed metadata are required for upload, allowing a powerful, biology-aware search on biological samples and experimental metadata. BioDare currently stores >20M datapoints from >1200 experiments, including reporter gene data from ROBuST. Since 2011 external users have been recruited and a user-protocol paper describing the analysis process was published (Moore et al., Meth. Mol. Biol. 2014). Partial cost recovery has commenced, with ten years of service purchased in the first year. The BioDare facility continues to be maintained by Zielinski in SynthSys and will be adapted to support SynthSys-Mammalian, Edinburgh's recently-awarded Synthetic Biology Research Centre. Data Analysis Software. ROBuST produced a broad range of data analysis and theoretical tools including: *Sensitivity Analysis Software for Systems (SASSy); *Spectrum Resampling algorithm that provides period analysis (Costa et al. Biostatistics 2013); *Reconstructing Transcription Open Software (ReTrOS) that back-calculates transcriptional dynamics from observed reporter gene timeseries; *CoAST (Comparative Analysis of Sets of TimeSeries) that identifies consistent waveform features across multiple replicate timeseries. The software is available at http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/systemsbiology/research/software/. Spectrum Resampling can also be accessed via BioDare. p:LUC marker lines. The ROBuST p:LUC collection, totalling 176 lines, represents the most comprehensive assembly of p:LUC reporter lines in a single (Col) accession. It comprises: Col wt expressing p:LUC constructs for ~ 40 clock, light and temperature genes, and 40 genotypes harbouring the pCor15a:LUC, pCCR2:LUC, pCAB2:LUC markers.

A process-based model was parameterised from ABACUS data and tested against CO2 eddy flux data and observed time series of stock changes. The initial results closely matched observed fluxes. We used our modelling to generate complete estimates of gross primary production (i.e. for gap filling, as EC data are never complete). Overall, birch woodlands were estimated to be almost twice as productive as tundra. However, we found some notable discrepancies between modelled and measured fluxes, particularly during the growing season at night. We are now using the chamber data to determine whether model or EC are likely to be correct. We also found differences in measurement and observation of late season fluxes, indicating potential errors in the phenology modelling or in the metabolic activity in the late season. We have shown how chamber data can be used to construct a simple model of net ecosystem C exchanges across a range of arctic vegetation. The modelling study indicated high sensitivity to initial conditions and vegetation functional type, so the heterogeneity of soils and vegetation requires explicit modelling. Objective: We addressed a source of uncertainty in the modelling of landscape C fluxes, namely whether measurements within patches of the main vegetation types are representative of the whole landscape We compared C fluxes in the transition zones between patches. We showed for the first time a consistent reduction in photosynthesis in transition zones, helping to constrain possible errors when modelling C fluxes from vegetation patches to the landscape scale. We have demonstrated that an information conserving approach to upscaling ecological structure and thereby function dramatically reduced bias in estimates of ecosystem carbon flux at larger spatial scales.

"BBSRC","BB/H022007/1","Fellowship","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","The Roslin Institute","Houston","Ross",NA,NA,"The sustainable production of fish through aquaculture faces a serious and persistent threat due to infectious disease outbreaks. Of particular relevance to the UK is the impact on Atlantic salmon of viral disease such as Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) and Pancreas Disease (PD). For both these diseases, we see clear genetic differences between fish in their resistance, which can be exploited via selective breeding to reduce the incidence of disease, and its impact on production. The overall aim of this research was to use high-throughput genomics approaches to gain an understanding of host genetic resistance, focusing on the exemplar of a major locus underlying resistance to IPN. IPN is known to impact at two distinct windows of the salmon lifecycle; firstly in freshwater shortly after hatching, and secondly shortly after transfer to seawater. Our previous research has demonstrated that the genetic resistance to IPN across both windows of susceptibility is under the control of a single region of the genome (QTL). In this fellowship project, restriction site associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) was applied to fine map the major locus to a smaller region of the genome, and to identify SNP markers associated with resistance at the population level. These SNP markers have been applied in marker-assisted selection to drastically reduce the prevalence of IPN on commercial salmon farms; one of the major success stories for genetic control of disease resistance in farmed animals. To identify genes and networks underpinning resistance to the IPN virus, RNA and microRNA sequencing of resistant and susceptible salmon was performed. This highlighted a striking difference in response to viral infection between the genotypes, with susceptible fish demonstrating a large innate immune response that was substantially less in the resistant fish. Concurrently, pooled whole genome sequencing of resistant and susceptible salmon was used to discover and characterise all genomic variants within the region of the salmon genome containing the major resistance locus. Integrating these datasets with the salmon reference genome sequence enabled the identification of the most likely candidate causative SNPs, and experiments to assess their mechanism of action are underway using cell line models. Additional outputs of the project included improved knowledge of salmon genome biology, and various genomics tools and resources for the study of salmon. These included high density linkage maps, a high density SNP array, genome annotation, and a microRNA database. In addition, a large scale experiment into the genetic basis of PD virus resistance resulted in mapping a second major resistance locus to chromosome 3 of salmon, and development of marker-based tests of resistance to this disease. Working alongside commercial partners has ensured that the results and technology developed in this fellowship have been rapidly applied in salmon aquaculture to help control viral disease outbreaks.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"r-8072595520.012635779f2b32","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=r-8072595520.012635779f2b32&grantRef=BB%2FH022007%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/H022007/1","1FB2D803-EAC2-46C2-B8AC-D93342F334BB","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","AEF3FD20-9B6A-4C56-B01F-2E70CCB9ABC5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Genetic markers to predict resistance will be used by the salmon aquaculture industry.

Turning attention to the ways culture, value and belief become apparent in our experiences and understandings of time, this project's core question was: What would be the time of a sustainable economy? Working with a range of national partners, the academic team visited 10 different organisations, interviewed experts in a further 7 organisations and visited 4 archive collections. The aim was to identify whether present or past attempts to develop alternative economic models could be understood as challenging dominant models of time. Rather than identifying a single 'sustainable time,' the project revealed the way such attempts involve complex negotiations between different kinds of time that might not always appear explicitly. In all cases, however, there were clear attempts to transform dominant understandings of time, particularly around the time of instant gratification, the time of community and struggles around concepts of productivity. The project also highlighted a range of methodological issues when researching time, including the lack of shared vocabulary, exemplified by its absence from archive catalogues, and the way assumptions about time operate largely implicitly.

These results highlight the importance of longitudinal analyses in the interpretation of climate change effects. 2) Individuals show high repeatability of foraging behaviour during the breeding season, but much reduced repeatability after they disperse for the winter. These results suggest that variation amongst individuals is higher when they are confined to a single location (around the breeding colony) and therefore experiencing similar environmental conditions. 3) Female shags increase their foraging time under stronger winds whilst males do not.

These have enabled fundamental understanding of the processes occurring in these systems, and, as they have proved to be robust in industrial conditions, the monitoring of the molten salt (pyrochemical) reprocessing of nuclear fuels. A range of different electrode types have also been developed, which have been shown to be able to monitor e.g. fuel relevant species and indicators of system corrosion at process relevant concentrations. This opens their path to commercial impact, through the development of industrially-relevant monitoring for molten salt systems, which have relevance not only to nuclear fuel reprocessing but also to e.g. energy storage systems and electrochemical processing based on molten salts. They have also enabled fundamental understanding of the key steps involved in electrochemical reaction in molten salt systems, including selective electroplating and stripping and electrochemical reaction for selective reprocessing, and the materials knowhow has informed the development of monitoring systems in other corrosive and industrially relevant high temperature environments. The wider REFINE consortium, which Professor Mount leads from Edinburgh, has produced the innovative research outputs and critical mass of training in oxide fuel reduction, sensing and monitoring and selective electrochemical extraction, informed by partnership with NNL, which are required to underpin future UK pyrochemical nuclear fuel reprocessing flowsheet development and implementation. Two added value CASE students with the National Nuclear Laboratory, Simon Reeves and Justin Elliott, completed their theses and taken up UK-based postdoctoral research posts. Simon took up a PDRA in REFINE relevant area; Justin is now the Laboratory Manager of the Pyrochemical Research Laboratory, a Government supported open access research laboratory awarded to, and established and run by Edinburgh. The PRL is now part of UK National Nuclear User Facilities (NNUF) and its capabilities are being expanded through an EPSRC grant to Edinburgh and Manchester for the Molten Salts Nuclear Technology Laboratory (MSNTL), which is now being procured. This therefore stimulates and provides underpinning capacity in UK molten salts research development. Professor Mount and Dr Elliott have now been appointed as Chair and Secretary respectively of the UK Molten Salts Advisory Group, formed to increase the quality and timeliness of advice to UK Govt on future molten salt research, development and innovation opportunities and investments to address e.g. the UK Nuclear Innovation Plan and Nuclear Industrial Strategy and the climate change emergency.

Some delay is due to PDRA recruitments and Prof Wang's job change. WP1. Rotating packed bed (24 months, Newcastle) WP1.2, investigating the effect of flow configuration on the rate of CO2 capture and absorber operating costs, has been completed. WP1.3, in which operational correlations were developed for the rotating packed bed, has been completed and these correlations have been passed to Sheffield University for use in optimisation studies. Two conference papers have been published for this WP1. WP2. Microwave assisted regeneration, amine corrosion and degradation (Edinburgh). This work package has been completed in December 2019. Nine journal articles from this work package have been published, and one workshop/seminar has been organized. After we found water in solvent solution consumes significant amount of microwave energy, the work proposed in WP2 has been reviewed and revised. Much effort has been made to find new solvents or non-aqueous mixture to reduce the energy consumption during microwave regeneration stage. We found that the mixture of some solvents provides better CO2 adsorption kinetics, adsorption capacity and much low energy consumption than the solvent aqueous solutions that typically used for CO2 capture. After investigating a number of solvents and their mixture, such as ether (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether - DEGMEE), amide (N-methylformamide - NMF), and a hydroxyl-containing mixture (ethylene glycol/1-propanol - EG/PrOH), monoethanolamine (MEA), we found that DEGMEE solutions, especially those at low MEA concentration (20-40 wt%) showed good absorption and desorption rates but also low energy consumptions during the regeneration steps. The energy/CO2 ratio obtained for the 20 wt% MEA in DEGMEE during the cycling process was found to be 78% lower than the value obtained for the conventional aqueous 30 wt% MEA solution. The use of microwaves to regenerate the solutions combined with the low dielectric constant of DEGMEE may explain these favorable results. The microwaves coupling preferentially and regenerating the MEA carbamates more efficiently than with the use of the other solvents. For WP2, new aqueous solutions were also developed using potentially more performant amines than MEA. After screening tests, best absorption and regeneration performances were achieved by the aqueous solution containing 40 wt% DMEA + 10 wt% PZ. In comparison to the conventional 30 wt% MEA solution (regenerated at 80&deg;C), this aqueous DMEA + PZ solution gave a better absorption and regeneration kinetics and the regeneration was easier, having a higher cyclic capacity while needing less energy. The regeneration was possible at a temperature as low as 70&deg;C [Work Package 2.7] and the energy/CO2 ratio obtained at 70&deg;C was found to be 73% lower than the value obtained for the conventional aqueous 30 wt% MEA solution at 80&deg;C. The additional funding is that the response of heating behaviour of a material to microwave varies significantly with the location at the wave position. Through tuning the wave position, we may be able to maximize the difference of heating behaviours of various materials to enhance the selective heating. One MSc student will continue this work from September 2020. WP3. Modelling of microwave regeneration (Edinburgh MS and PDRA 3) (24th month, Edinburgh) WP3 has been completed. three research articles have been published and the third article is under review. The objective of WP3 is to investigate the mechanism and numerically evaluate microwave heating in post-combustion CO2 capture using amine. We accurately evaluated the ability of available empirical force fields of liquid water to predict its dielectric properties, and demonstrated the capability of molecular dynamics simulations for quantitative description of microwave heating of liquids. We concluded the poor quality of existing empirical force fields of liquid MEA in predicting its experimental dielectric properties. We conducted heating simulations of aqueous amine solutions using electromagnetic radiation with different frequencies in the microwave region. In addition to these molecular dynamics heating simulations, we also conducted first-principles electronic structure calculations to investigate possible non-thermal effects of microwave. We found that frequency-tuned infrared heating is very beneficial for an efficient amine regeneration in post-combustion amine stripping CO2 capture technology. To seek an extra fund to experimentally confirm the above preferential infrared heating computational findings, we submitted a six months research proposal to the Centre for Advanced Materials for Renewable Energy Generation (CAMREG) flexible funding, but not successful. A full proposal of this work is ready for submission to EPSRC. If these results are successfully confirmed, they will give great impact on both energy consumption and performance of the energy-demanding amine regeneration process involved in the post-combustion amine stripping CO2 capture technology. WP4. Process modelling & technical and economic performance assessment (Sheffield) 6 articles have been published for WP4. Modelling, validation and analysis of RPB absorber model at pilot scale have been completed. Sheffield managed to validate the physical properties (comparison between model predictions and experimental data) for high concentration MEA. They compared different correlation for mass transfer in the context of RPB. The steady state modelling of RPB absorber has finished. Current experimental data (from small amount in batch) using microwave for MEA regeneration is difficult to be used for model validation purpose. The model-based study indicates that it is necessary to have inter-cooler for RPB Absorber, as high concentration MEA used & the relative low residence time result in an excessive temperature increase (up to 80oC) in RPB Absorber. This will clearly inhibit absorption performance. Two strategies for deploying RPB absorber intercooler namely stationary (shell-and-tube heat exchanger and plate heat exchanger) and rotary intercooler designs were proposed and evaluated. The rotary intercooler addresses both the need for compact design and lower pressure drop. The findings will be very helpful for commercial deployment of intensified solvent-based carbon capture. We found that modified packed column mass transfer correlations with the g term (i.e. gravitational acceleration) replaced with rw2 (i.e. centrifugal acceleration) commonly used in literature for RPBs generally give poor predictions. The Tung and Mah (1985) correlation gave a good prediction of liquid film mass transfer coefficient in RPBs, slightly better than more complex correlations such as the Chen et al . (2006). The data of gas film mass transfer coefficient for RPBs were also derived from overall mass transfer coefficient (K_G a) experimental data from the literature. This is the first report of gas film mass transfer data for RPBs in literature. We demonstrated that Chen (2011) predicts gas film mass transfer coefficient better when the parameter (Kn) is updated from 0.023 to 0.23 comparing against two independent data. The validity of the analysis and conclusions in this study are based on a single type of packing (unstructured wire mesh). With other packing types, namely expamet and retimet among others, the performance of the correlations may be very different. For instance, efforts in our group to use Luo et al. (2012a) for predicting effective interfacial area of expamet packings showed that the predicted values were out of range, although more data is needed to confirm this finding. The performance of the correlations should be demonstrated for other types of packings for RPB such as expamet and retimet as the relevant data become available.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"58a62b47a98195.42260736","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=58a62b47a98195.42260736&grantRef=EP%2FN024672%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N024672/1","F99B4059-0552-4B8F-8314-681B3E87DA79","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","208779E3-923B-47C1-B610-B253D51A4A36",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publications in scientific journals and refereed conferences","Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/N024672/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Research Grant","Fan","Xianfeng",NA,"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6811-953X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"A compact CO2 capture process to combat industrial emissions","31/07/2016","30/07/2020",982113,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N024672/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","208779E3-923B-47C1-B610-B253D51A4A36","School of Engineering","College of Science and Engineering"
"BBSRC","BB/S004181/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","The Roslin Institute","Macqueen","Daniel",NA,NA,"Using genome sequencing and a mature bioinformatic pipeline, we have identified ~3,000 new structural variants (SVs) and confirmed ~3,000 already known SVs in 20 Atlantic salmon individuals, 10 resistant and 10 susceptible to ameobic gill disease. We have identified SVs that represent candidate functional variants for disease resistance. This data adds to a much larger dataset of 15,483 SVs we have generated for 492 Atlantic salmon, in BBSRC funded work, which were published in Nature Communications (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18972-x). SVs are a major source of genetic and phenotypic variation, but have remained challenging to accurately type and thus remain poorly characterized in most species. Our analyses have been overcoming these barriers and have provided insights into the role of SVs in genome evolution and the genetic architecture of farmed salmon traits. We have also generated new resources supporting reliable SV discovery in non-model species. We have further developed a method exploiting low-coverage sequencing to genotype SVs accurately genome-wide using imputation based approaches. We are in the process of sequencing 500 Atlantic salmon genomes at low coverage, from a commercial population with extensive existing data on AGD resistance; we will use this data to genotype SVs and SNPs genome-wide, estimate the heritability explained by SVs, run a GWAS for ameobic gill disease resistance, and test the application of SVs for enhancing genomic prediction accuracy for ameobic gill disease. Such approaches will allow future studies to capture SVs as genetic markers at a much reduced cost, which may advance their exploitation in aquaculture and other areas such as salmon conservation genetics. We aim to publish our findings demonstrating the SV imputation approach in 2022. In a separate task within the AquaLeap project, we have generated a new chromosome level reference genome for the European flat oyster. Despite a growing interest in genetic applications to support population management and aquaculture in this species, a reference genome assembly has been lacking. Our chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation was generated by combining several technologies: Oxford Nanopore, Illumina, and Dovetail OmniCTM proximity ligation sequencing. A contig assembly (N50: 2.38Mb) was scaffolded into the expected karyotype of 10 pseudo-chromosomes. The finished assembly has a total length of 935.13 Mb, scaffold-N50 of 95.56 Mb and is comprised of 57.3% repeats, dominated by unclassified elements specific to O. edulis. The assembly was verified for quality and accuracy using multiple metrics, including a novel linkage map built with ddRAD-Seq technology, comprising 4,016 SNPs from four full-sib families (8 parents and 163 F1 offspring). Annotation of the genome integrating multi-tissue RNA-Seq, comparative protein evidence and ab-initio gene prediction identified 35,699 protein-coding genes. Chromosome level synteny was demonstrated against several high-quality bivalve genome assemblies, including an O. edulis genome generated independently for a French O. edulis individual. Comparative genomics was used to characterize gene family expansions during Ostrea evolution, in a phylogenetic framework capturing diverse bivalve lineages, revealing potential functions and genes that may have facilitated recent flat oyster adaptation. This new reference genome for European flat oyster opens the door to high-resolution genomics in support of conservation and aquaculture initiatives, and improves our understanding of bivalve genome evolution.

These resources are in press with Island Research and Education Initiative, and will be available (gratis) to beneficiaries outlined in the final text box below. We have applied for follow-on funding to trial some of our completed creative resources, alongside draft teaching packs, with teachers in the Marshall Islands and Hawai'i, in 2019. 2) Through our partnership with the University of the South Pacific, Majuro campus, we trained a Marshallese translator and a local research assistant who learned new skills in data collection and analysis, and public/community engagement, and have both been able to build on the success of their involvement on the project: translator Marcus Bennett received a scholarship to further develop his linguistic skills in Taiwan, and research assistant Aileen Sefeti now has permanent employment at USP Majuro.

Building on existing baseline data, collected within a before/after, control/impact study designed to evaluate the impacts of Wildlife Management Areas - a form of community-based natural resource management - we collected detailed data on demographics, trends in well being, shocks, coping strategies, livelihoods, assets and access to natural resources and conflict. Key findings show: (1) Virtually all households reporting having experienced environmental shocks to their livelihoods over the period of study, including unusually heavy rain and unusually low rain but not all are uniquely attributable to the El Nino event. The pattern of locally-reported shocks is complex, with approximately half of households reporting both periods of unusually heavy rain and periods of unusually low rain. In many areas however, traditional environmental shocks feature less prominently in local people's concerns than damage from wildlife. (2) Households adopt a diverse set of coping strategies to manage the effects of environmental shocks, but the most common responses to both heavy and low rainfall events are modifications of existing strategies. Diversification and sale of assets are less common, but adopted by a minority of households except in our northern study areas, where sale of assets was an important response to low rainfall events. Few households report being able to rely on formal or informal aid. (3) The set of coping strategies adopted by households show clear differentiation by the type of shock experienced, geographic area and household-level characteristics, but we found no clear evidence for either a positive or a negative effect of wildlife management areas on households' adoption of coping strategies (4) On average, coping strategies were more likely to be adopted by households whose livelihoods were more dependent on livestock or had a higher dependency ratio, but less likely to be adopted by female-headed households.

Being able to get outdoors is essential for maintaining health and wellbeing into later life, but many older people find it becomes less easy, enjoyable and meaningful as they age. Meanwhile, our society is growing older: across Europe, the number of people aged 60+ is expected to increase by around two million, annually, for the foreseeable future. To help ensure that living longer is a positive experience for everyone, we need evidence-based solutions to known challenges. The Mobility, Mood and Place (MMP) research project has been exploring how places can be designed collaboratively to support outdoor activity, health, wellbeing and participation decisions about the community as people age. Drawing on the participation of over 900 people, most of whom were aged 60+, our findings have implications for the way we design for people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities. These are our key findings and their implications: * Four qualities of places really make a difference to quality of life: access for all, access to nature, access to others and access to light. * The mundane matters and the commonplace counts! Everyday things, such as pavement quality, benches and street lighting, can make all the difference as we get older. * Busy urban environments demand and direct our attention; too much of this makes us cognitively fatigued, less effective and more stressed. Older people walking between different types of urban environments show changes in their emotional response to place based on brain activity patterns. Green spaces seem to be restorative, offering a respite from the demands that busy urban places make on our attention. * Even a short walk can lift the mood if the environment is sufficiently varied. Things like colour and wildlife, opportunities for social contact, and familiar places, especially those linked to key memories, are highly valued. * The design and layout of the home can help older people to be more active. * Well-designed environments can support older adults who have experienced a stroke to engage in, and return to, the activities they value. * Healthy ageing is influenced by local environments throughout our lives, including right back to childhood. Features of the environment - such as nearby access to public parks - can have lifelong positive associations with healthy ageing, and in particular with better cognitive health in later life. What are the messages for the future? * Innovative neuroscience methods offer new opportunities to understand older people's response to place * We need to take very long term views on fostering resilience and healthy ageing. * the quality of the outdoor environment we provide for children is important for them then, and throughout the rest of their lives. * Plan well, design well, maintain well - these are vitally important for everyday, health-enhancing environments throughout our lives.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"56c32f4b3bb3d6.28390829","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=56c32f4b3bb3d6.28390829&grantRef=EP%2FK037404%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K037404/1","17B5E480-CC10-417E-9532-7A5136A048F1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","3E3E42C4-8B36-476B-8DA0-48AEC4DDEFC8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"This project has already had impact at European, UK and local levels in supporting policies for age-friendly built environments and training practitioners and third sector workers for their implementation in practice.

All the researchers concerned are involved in developing the mathematics of biological diversity, so the activities chosen were all oriented towards that goal. The researchers involved in the grant were split across the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. As the sole investigator from Edinburgh, I will describe here the activities that I was involved in personally. As one aspect of the grant, I took several courses in biological subjects relevant to our research on the measurement of diversity: * Evolution Today, online course run by National Museum of Natural History, Leiden, Netherlands (Sep-Nov 2016). This was a general introductory course covering the basics of evolutionary biology, including the role of amino acids and DNA, an introduction to evolutionary development biology, the basics of genetics, individuals vs. groups in evolution, and game-theoretic aspects of evolution. * Molecular Analyses for Biodiversity and Conservation, MSc course, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow (Feb-Mar 2017). This provided me with training on topics including genetic diversity and the role of gene flow, the representation of phylogenetic data and DNA barcoding, and methods such as principal component analysis for inferring population structure. * Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics, short course, Roslin Institute, Edinburgh. After an introduction to quantitative genetics, this covered topics such as the statistical modelling of populations, the dynamics of random mating, and the notion of effective population size (which is closely related to questions about how best to measure biological diversity). In the opposite direction, I gave an extended seminar course (11 hours of lectures) on the mathematics behind diversity measurement. This was specifically designed to be accessible to non-mathematicians, and indeed, was attended by several biologists, as well as mathematical biologists and a very mixed group of mathematicians and physicists. It was held at the University of Edinburgh in January-March 2017. The lively participation between biologists and mathematicians at this course provoked some new mathematical results of direct biological relevance. For example, we now have precise mathematical results classifying all the measures of biodiversity that behave in a reasonable manner. Starting from my notes from this course and adding further material that arose directly from it, I have now written a book: Entropy and Diversity: The Axiomatic Approach, to be published in April 2021 by Cambridge University Press.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"58a1ec9657de24.39877867","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=keyfindings&outcomeId=58a1ec9657de24.39877867&grantRef=BB%2FP004210%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/P004210/1","E31A85B3-B41C-4AFD-8B83-A58DA53F70CA","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","AFD18818-E0A7-4518-97F9-046DB40BA2A6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Being a FLIP award rather than a standard research grant, the main purpose of the award was to educate the researchers involved in each others' subjects (rather than to create new research findings).

This award has allowed the mathematicians involved to deepen their biological knowledge, and vice versa. More specifically, our collaborative work is about identifying and developing appropriate measures of biological diversity, that are mathematically coherent but also faithfully represent biological reality. Our deepened knowledge of each others' subjects, and the research findings that this has led to, has moved us forward in this. As a result, we have developed diversity measures for structured communities, with accompanying software packages that can be used by life scientists without having to learn the mathematics behind them.","Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Other","https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2017/04/functional_equations_entropy_a.html",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BB/P004210/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Mathematics","Research Grant","Leinster","Thomas",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mathematical Theory and Biological Applications of Diversity","31/08/2016","30/08/2018",40920,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/P004210/1","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","AFD18818-E0A7-4518-97F9-046DB40BA2A6","School of Mathematics","College of Science and Engineering"
"NERC","NE/E004946/1","Research Grant","Key Findings","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Biological Sciences","Smiseth","Per",NA,NA,"This project made significant new discoveries in how the terrestrial physical environment can drive the abundance of freshwater insects over many different spatial scales. Most previous work in this area has focused on how the aquatic environment influence (e.g. water quality, hydraulics) influences the abundance of aquatic juveniles, whereas this project demonstrated that the availability of egg-laying sites and behaviours of the terrestrial, adult stages of aquatic insects can drive the abundance all life stages (eggs, juveniles, adults). This information is critical to river managers charged with restoring and conserving the biodiversity of riverine systems, but who have relatively little guidance on how to protect the majority of the aquatic species. Our research highlights some aspects of the importance of the terrestrial environment are essential to aquatic ecosystems and that can easily be incorporated into monitoring and restoration programmes. Our research outcomes have also resulted in a major shift in perspectives for freshwater ecology, i.e. previously, the received wisdom suggested that population dynamics of freshwater invertebrates (the majority of the freshwater fauna) were determined by events in the lives of aquatic juveniles, whereas our research indicates that the behaviour of adults during the brief egg-laying period can have profound consequences for populations. This new perspective has opened up new research avenues and new projects which examine and integrate events during all insect life stages, not just the juveniles. For example, these ideas sparked a PhD project recently completed by W. Bovill at the University of Melbourne, and were pivotal to a new, three-year research project recently funded by the Australian Research Council (DP160102262), Explaining species diversity in a fractal world. This new project is based at the University of Melbourne, but involves a research team of ecologists, geomorphologists and modelers from three universities in the UK and Australia. A further research proposal is currently being considered by the Australian Research Council and will involve a multidisciplined research team from four institutions in Australia and the USA.

Different kinds of beekeepers have significantly different understandings of what bees are. This has implications for bee health. Conventional beekeepers who use the modern hive, direct bees towards productivity and deploy a Pasteurian approach to bee health - preferring to open up hives for inspection, and to treat disease with antimicrobials and miticides. 'Sustainable' or 'natural' beekeepers are less interested in directing bees towards productivity, and see a bee colony as one organism surrounded by a skin. These beekeepers see conventional beehives as a cause of poor health in honeybees, and have a range of strategies to deal with disease, including allowing natural selection to take place. 2. Beekeepers can be differentiated on the basis of the sensory information that they rely on to know their bees. Conventional beekeepers predominantly rely on visual inspection of the inside of the hive, large scale migratory beekeepers rely on olfactory information gained from quickly lifting the lid of the hive. 'Sustainable' or 'natural' beekeepers deploy a meditative approach to their interactions with bees. 3. City beekeeping requires a careful balance between making visible and rendering invisible in order for the general public to coexist with increasing urban honeybee populations without fear. City beekeeping organisations deploy forms of mapping - of hives, of forage, of bee hotels, and of postcode honey in order to encourage neighbourliness. City beekeepers however, must also take great care to manage swarms, which in turn shapes the kind of beekeeping that is possible in urban areas. Swarms often cause fear amongst the public even though they are generally harmless.

"EPSRC","EP/K000446/1","Research Grant","Policy Influence","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Gibbins","Jonathan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The UKCCSRC has regularly engaged with policy-makers in activities ranging from invited briefings to formal consultation responses. These activities have had a broad range of outcomes including improved knowledge and understanding of the breadth, depth and quality of UK academic work on CCS among UK policy-makers. This activity also ensured that emerging findings from the academic community were available in a timely way to policy-makers.

The Centre regularly receives requests to provide consultation responses or to contribute to document/strategy preparation by stakeholders. The Centre's Coordination Group decides how such requests will be handled: the Centre either passes such requests to Centre members to respond in a personal capacity, or asks Centre members to provide comment to the Centre so that it can submit a corporate response. In the latter case members are asked to confirm in writing that they agree with the content of the Centre's response before it is formally submitted. The UKCCSRC and its members have contributed to the development of all UK national research roadmaps for CCS, by responding to consultations and as members of working groups etc.

The below lists UKCCSRC policy inputs - activities of particular note are reported elsewhere in this submission in fuller detail.

- Ongoing: engagement with the CCSA and membership of its working groups

The UKCCSRC Coordination Group members are responsible for monitoring the scientific aspects of all UKCCSRC-funded activities in their respective specialisations. 

The Coordination Group members and Research Area Champions also undertake individual policy engagement, through which they ensure academic input to policy and UKCCSRC involvement as relevant. Activities through which CG and RAC engage with policy include:

- Individual contributions to consultations and reports
- Membership of advisory groups including the CCS Development Forum (the UK Government's Policy Advisory group), the DECC Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), the European Commission's Zero Emission Power (ZEP) technology platform Task Forces on Public Communications and Industrial CCS, the Thermal Generation and CCS Industry Leadership Group in Scotland, and the Engineering Policy Group Scotland
- Organisation of briefings and visits for Ministers, civil servants, the EU Parliament, and Research Councils
- Participation in standards committees related to CCS
- Attending and speaking at policy-focused meetings (including the EU2030 Energy Union and Carbon Capture Journal meeting &quot;Keeping CCS Moving&quot;, February 2015; the EU Energy Challenge summit, Brussels, November 2014; Westminster Energy, Environment and Transport Forum's event, Next Steps for CCS in the UK, February 2014; Scottish Enterprise - CCS Hub Scotland facilitated workshop, September 2012).",NA,"58b6fd156f0789.80929304","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=58b6fd156f0789.80929304&grantRef=EP%2FK000446%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","DAD8D8F7-42C8-4BDC-8AFA-1F77CC7433B2","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UKCCSRC - Policy Engagement","Membership of a guideline committee",NA,"National",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/K000446/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Research Grant","Gibbins","Jonathan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UKCCSRC - The United Kingdom Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre","31/03/2012","31/12/2015",10127951,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4","School of Engineering","College of Science and Engineering"

Evidence was published on 11 September 2013: https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/submissions-uk-parliamentary-call-evidence-inquiry-ccs-published.

In addition to the Centre submission, individual members also submitted separate responses. CG member Stuart Haszeldine was invited to follow up by giving evidence in Parliament to the committee in October 2013 (https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/prof-stuart-haszeldine-gives-evidence-ccs-parliament), and Director Jon Gibbins and CG member David Reiner were invited to follow up by giving evidence to the Committee in a session in Sheffield in January 2014. During this session the Committee took evidence from CCS experts including UKCCSRC Members - a transcript of the evidence is available on the ECCC web site (http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/energy-and-climate-change-committee/carbon-capture-and-storage/oral/5618.pdf).

The Energy and Climate Change Select Committee also made a fact-finding visit to the UKCCSRC PACT facilities while in Sheffield. During their visit to PACT, the Committee participated in an introductory discussion on the equipment at PACT and its applications and then made a detailed tour of the site. 

Tim Yeo MP, Chair of the Committee, said of the day &quot;Carbon capture and storage could be a key technology helping us to decarbonise our power sector and heavy industry. There is currently a disappointing lack of progress on developing CCS. The PACT facilities are an excellent example of the types of R&amp;D projects the UK should be investing in to ensure we have a home grown low-carbon industry here in the UK. I look forward to seeing firsthand how the facilities are bridging the gap between bench-scale R&amp;D and industrial pilot scale projects accelerating the development of novel carbon capture technologies. I am sure that our experience here will help to feed into our wider work on CCS.&quot;","https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/submissions-uk-parliamentary-call-evidence-inquiry-ccs-published","5464882d8ef408.54785704","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=policyinfluence&outcomeId=5464882d8ef408.54785704&grantRef=EP%2FK000446%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","DAD8D8F7-42C8-4BDC-8AFA-1F77CC7433B2","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UKCCSRC Contributions to UK Parliamentary Select Committee for Energy and Climate Change's Inquiry into CCS","Gave evidence to a government review",NA,"National",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/K000446/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Research Grant","Gibbins","Jonathan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UKCCSRC - The United Kingdom Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre","31/03/2012","31/12/2015",10127951,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4","School of Engineering","College of Science and Engineering"

The report recommended that the Woodland Carbon Code committee consider moving to a fixed buffer system. At this time, each project certified under the code had to conduct a risk assessment prior to project commencement, which was then independently verified, and used to assess the amount of carbon credits set aside as a buffer against future losses.

Visual analysis includes synchrotron images from the Diamond Light Source and electron back scatter diffraction images on polished coral skeletons. Physical analyses include Raman spectroscopy data. Skeletal samples analysed were from the Southern California Bight (SCB), USA, and the Mingulay Reef Complex (MRC), UK. SCB samples were collected in 2010, 2014 and 2015. MRC samples were collected in 2012. Samples from the SCB cover an environmental gradient with respect to aragonite saturation, and corals from Mingulay were subjected to long-term experimentation in projected future conditions. SCB carbonate chemistry and sample metadata is included here, and conditions for MRC samples are outlined in Hennige et al. 2015. Ocean acidification is a threat to cold-water coral reefs in terms of dissolution to their skeletons, and their subsequent structural stability. This will likely determine the stability of the habitats they form.

However, the synergistic effect of these stressors on coral physiology is still poorly understood, in particular for cold-water corals. This study assessed changes in key physiological parameters (calcification, respiration and ammonium excretion) of the widespread cold-water coral Desmophyllum dianthus maintained for ~8 months at two temperatures (ambient 12&deg;C and elevated 15&deg;C) and two pCO2 conditions (ambient 390 ppm and elevated 750 ppm). At ambient temperatures no change in instantaneous calcification, respiration or ammonium excretion rates was observed at either pCO2 levels. Conversely, elevated temperature (15&deg;C) significantly reduced calcification rates, and combined elevated temperature and pCO2 significantly reduced respiration rates. Changes in the ratio of respired oxygen to excreted nitrogen (O:N), which provides information on the main sources of energy being metabolized, indicated a shift from mixed use of protein and carbohydrate/lipid as metabolic substrates under control conditions, to less efficient protein-dominated catabolism under both stressors. Overall, this study shows that the physiology of D. dianthus is more sensitive to thermal than pCO2 stress, and that the predicted combination of rising temperatures and ocean acidification in the coming decades may severely impact this cold-water coral species.",NA,2017,"Gori A., Ferrier-Pag&egrave;s C., Hennige S.J., Murray F., Rottier C., Wicks L.C., Roberts J.M.

The data were collected during March 2015 as a series of triplicate 25 m x 2 m transects parallel to shore, at three locations on the reef flat: near (70 m from the shore), mid (140 m from the shore) and far (210 m from the shore). All locations were at similar depths of 1 m. Along each transect the number and size of all coralliths and total number of non-free living individuals were recorded, alongside with several environmental parameters (Water Temperature, Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR), Total Alkalinity, Dissolved Inorganic Carbon and Dissolved Oxygen). Abundance and size of coralliths was recorded through non-invasive techniques and the environmental parameters were obtained through multiple instruments: Fluorometer, Oxygen sensor, spectrophotometry, Titration and a PAR logger.

Understanding mechanisms of change requires long-term monitoring of multiple ecological parameters. Here, we present the findings of a collaboration between government scientists, local people, park rangers and academic researchers that provide insights into changes in plant composition, phenology and growth over 18 years on Qikiqtaruk-Herschel Island, Canada. Qikiqtaruk is an important focal research site located at the latitudinal tall shrub line in the western Arctic. This unique ecological monitoring program indicates the following findings: 1) nine days per decade advance of spring phenology, 2) a doubling of average plant canopy height per decade, but no directional change in shrub radial growth and 3) a doubling of shrub and graminoid abundance and a decrease by half in bare ground cover per decade. Ecological changes are concurrent with satellite-observed greening and when integrated suggest that indirect warming from increased growing season length and active layer depths, rather than warming summer air temperatures alone, could be important drivers of the observed tundra vegetation change.

Purpose: We combined individual datasets of shrub growth from sites around the tundra biome to explore the climate sensitivity of shrub growth.

Abstract: This dataset consists of tundra shrub growth data from 37 arctic and alpine sites in 9 countries, including 25 species, and ~42 000 annual growth records from 1821 individuals.

Summary: Rapid temperature increases in the tundra biome have been linked to increasing shrub dominance. Shrub expansion can modify climate by altering surface albedo, energy and water balance, and permafrost, yet the drivers of shrub growth remain poorly understood. Dendroecological data consisting of multi-decadal time series of annual shrub growth provide an underused resource to explore climate-growth relationships.",NA,2018,"These data are being used in a number of collaborations and have contributed to the following papers/manuscripts:

 scales for 2001--2010. Model simulations were driven with a variety of meteorological datasets and at various spatial resolutions (0.5x0.5, 1x1, 2x2 degree resolution). The meteorological datasets include:
 
 1. WFDEI-GPCC 
 The WATCH Forcing Data methodology was applied to the ERA-Interim reanalysis data (WFDEI) for the 1979--2012 period (Weedon et al., 2014. https://doi.org/10.1002/2014WR015638 ). WFDEI has two precipitation products, corrected using either CRU (Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia) or GPCC (Global Precipitation Climatology Centre) precipitation totals and are referred to as WFDEI-CRU and WFDEI-GPCC, respectively.
 
 2. WFDEI-CRU 
 See above.
 
 3. PRINCETON 
 The PRINCETON dataset is a global 62 year near-surface meteorological dataset used for driving land surface models and was created by Princeton University's Terrestrial Hydrology Group ( http://hydrology.princeton.edu/home.php ) (Sheffield et al., 2006. https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI3790.1 ).
 
 JULES GPP was then compared to spatially gridded estimates of GPP from the upscaling of GPP from the FLUXNET network (FLUXNET-MTE), the MODIS sensor and the CARDAMOM framework. 
 
 GPP, Gross Primary Productivity, is the total amount of carbon uptake by plants (per unit area in unit time) and used in photosynthesis. All files are in netCDF format. There is metadata in the files. To briefly view information regarding the files, there is software on Linux called ncdump (to read the data and metadata) and ncview (to plot the data without writing computer code).",NA,2016,"This study evaluates the ability of the JULES land surface model (LSM) to simulate photosynthesis using local and global data sets at 12 FLUXNET sites. Model param- eters include site-specific (local) values for each flux tower site and the default parameters used in the Hadley Cen- tre Global Environmental Model (HadGEM) climate model. Firstly, gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates from driving JULES with data derived from local site measure- ments were compared to observations from the FLUXNET network. When using local data, the model is biased with to- tal annual GPP underestimated by 16 % across all sites com- pared to observations. Secondly, GPP estimates from driving JULES with data derived from global parameter and atmo- spheric reanalysis (on scales of 100km or so) were com- pared to FLUXNET observations. It was found that model performance decreases further, with total annual GPP under- estimated by 30 % across all sites compared to observations. When JULES was driven using local parameters and global meteorological data, it was shown that global data could be used in place of FLUXNET data with a 7 % reduction in to- tal annual simulated GPP. Thirdly, the global meteorological data sets, WFDEI and PRINCETON, were compared to local data to find that the WFDEI data set more closely matches the local meteorological measurements (FLUXNET). Finally, the JULES phenology model was tested by comparing results from simulations using the default phenology model to those forced with the remote sensing product MODIS leaf area in- dex (LAI). Forcing the model with daily satellite LAI results in only small improvements in predicted GPP at a small num- ber of sites, compared to using the default phenology model.","https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/8/295/2015/gmd-8-295-2015.pdf","5c6eb427a911e8.84828699","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchdatabaseandmodel&outcomeId=5c6eb427a911e8.84828699&grantRef=NE%2FK002619%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K002619/1","4D6BF013-631B-4B24-ABB6-9AC8CF1C4F93","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","B5BB39B9-0CFA-4514-8973-73C327F59EFE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Database/Collection of data","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/K002619/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Williams","Mathew",NA,"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6117-5208",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Generating Regional Emissions Estimates with a Novel Hierarchy of Observations and Upscaled Simulation Experiments (GREENHOUSE)","31/03/2013","29/09/2017",1190027,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K002619/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","B5BB39B9-0CFA-4514-8973-73C327F59EFE","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

In particular, present-day model skill can be used to evaluate their potential performance in future climate simulations. Multi-model averaging methods have been used extensively in climate and hydrological sciences, but they have not been used to constrain projected plant productivity responses to climate change, which is a major uncertainty in earth system modelling. Here, we use three global observation-orientated estimates of current net primary productivity (NPP) to perform a reliability ensemble averaging (REA) using 30 global simulations of the 21st century change in NPP based on the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) 'business as usual' emissions scenario.",NA,2018,"We find that the three REAs support an increase in global NPP by the end of the 21st century (2095-2099) compared to 2001-2005, which is 2 - 3% stronger than the ensemble ISIMIP mean value of 24.2 Pg C y-1. Using REA also leads to a 45 - 68% reduction in the global uncertainty of 21st century NPP projection, which strengthens confidence in the resilience of the CO2 fertilization effect to climate change. This reduction in uncertainty is especially clear for boreal ecosystems although it may be an artefact due to the lack of representation of nutrient limitations on NPP in most models. Conversely, the large uncertainty that remains on the sign of the response of NPP in semi-arid regions points to the need for better observations and model development in these regions.","https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2017-83","5c6eae3df041c7.23711360","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchdatabaseandmodel&outcomeId=5c6eae3df041c7.23711360&grantRef=NE%2FK002619%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K002619/1","4D6BF013-631B-4B24-ABB6-9AC8CF1C4F93","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","B5BB39B9-0CFA-4514-8973-73C327F59EFE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Database/Collection of data","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/K002619/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Williams","Mathew",NA,"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6117-5208",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Generating Regional Emissions Estimates with a Novel Hierarchy of Observations and Upscaled Simulation Experiments (GREENHOUSE)","31/03/2013","29/09/2017",1190027,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K002619/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","B5BB39B9-0CFA-4514-8973-73C327F59EFE","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

This means that conventional amine processes will result in a relatively high energy penalty while novel adsorbents and adsorption processes have the potential to improve the efficiency of separation. High-selectivity adsorbents are required to achieve relatively high CO2 uptake at low partial pressures, which means that the separation process should be based on either very strong physisorption or chemisorption with thermal regeneration. From the process point of view, the main challenge is to develop efficient separation processes with rapid thermal cycles. In the associated paper, the authors present a detailed overview of the methodology behind the development of novel materials and processes as part of the &quot;Adsorption Materials and Processes for Gas fired power plants&quot; (AMPGas) project. Examples from a wide variety of materials tested are presented and the design of an innovative bench scale 12-column Rotary Wheel Adsorber system is discussed.

The mode of analysis that our work takes up is that of questioning value and related categories as definite empirically perceived phenomena. We contend that the valuation of ecosystem services -- even in its post-normal forms -- and the ecosystem services framework not only fail to examine value-based categories, but reproduce the problematic aspects of value-based social relations, which ultimately bear on the ecological issues affecting the P&aacute;ramo. Upon this premise we set out to formalise a (computational) dialogical scenario where arguments stating distinct, and often contradictory, actions delineate possible forms of appropriating the P&aacute;ramo, while motivating the examination of their defining sociality.",NA,2020,"A critical appraisal of the value-based sociality, as assimilated into the Paramo culture, is conducive to a dialogical setting where alternative water use practices are delineated.

Five codes have been obtained (RASPA, MuSiC, Towhee, Cassandra, DL_MONTE) and their performance and accuracy compared in application system above. Firstly it was important to establish that all codes are consistent with each other and under what conditions. Secondly, it was important to compare their performance. Currently we are working on associated publication and the database will be released to the general public along with the publicationm",NA,NA,"Material screening for adsorption applications is becoming a very important area of research particularly in application to carbon capture and to methane storage. This requires in general computationally efficient and accurate tools, specifically Monte Carlo methods traditionally used for adsorption problems. In molecular dynamics community, the scale of the community and the interest in large biological system, has been driving the development of benchmarks and case studies which would test the performance and accuracy of the md codes. This is not the case for Monte Carlo community, where systematic comparison of the codes in terms of accuracy and performance is lacking.

This database of case studies is the first example of benchmarking the Monte Carlo codes. It will allow the researchers to identify the best code for their applications, to build their own case studies and simulations set up, and it will help to validate the newly developed codes, by providing accurate reference data.",NA,"58beada328b7c3.54197503","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchdatabaseandmodel&outcomeId=58beada328b7c3.54197503&grantRef=EP%2FN007859%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N007859/1","5267D67E-86DC-4FB5-AE79-5E98913481F3","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","C360B097-E00C-48AB-B18A-D7FF8C544E7C",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Computer model/algorithm","No",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/N007859/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Research Grant","Sarkisov","Lev",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Multi-scale engineering toolbox for systematic assessment of porous materials in the context of adsorption and membrane separations","01/03/2016","30/08/2019",764650,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N007859/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","C360B097-E00C-48AB-B18A-D7FF8C544E7C","School of Engineering","College of Science and Engineering"

The European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite, with observations in the red-edge spectral region, can monitor crops globally at sub-field spatial resolutions (10-20 m). However, satellite LAI estimates require calibration with ground measurements. Calibration is challenged by spatial heterogeneity and scale mismatches between field and satellite measurements. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), generating high-resolution (cm-scale) LAI estimates, provide intermediary observations that we use here to characterise uncertainty and reduce spatial scaling discrepancies between Sentinel-2 observations and field surveys. We use a novel UAV multispectral sensor that matches Sentinel-2 spectral bands, flown in conjunction with LAI ground measurements. UAV and field surveys were conducted on multiple dates-coinciding with different wheat growth stages-that corresponded to Sentinel-2 overpasses. We compared chlorophyll red-edge index (CIred-edge) maps, derived from the Sentinel-2 and UAV platforms. We used Gaussian processes regression machine learning to calibrate a UAV model for LAI, based on ground data. Using the UAV LAI, we evaluated a two-stage calibration approach for generating robust LAI estimates from Sentinel-2. The agreement between Sentinel-2 and UAV CIred-edge values increased with growth stage-R2 ranged from 0.32 (stem elongation) to 0.75 (milk development). The CIred-edge variance between the two platforms was more comparable later in the growing season due to a more homogeneous and closed wheat canopy. The single-stage Sentinel-2 LAI calibration (i.e., direct calibration from ground measurements) performed poorly (mean R2 = 0.29, mean NRMSE = 17%) when compared to the two-stage calibration using the UAV data (mean R2 = 0.88, mean NRMSE = 8%). The two-stage approach reduced both errors and biases by &gt;50%. By upscaling ground measurements and providing more representative model training samples, UAV observations provide an effective and viable means of enhancing Sentinel-2 wheat LAI retrievals. We anticipate that our UAV calibration approach to resolving spatial heterogeneity would enhance the retrieval accuracy of LAI and additional biophysical variables for other arable crop types and a broader range of vegetation cover types.",NA,2020,"Supports the ATEC publications","https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2889","6040cf91314829.05893680","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchdatabaseandmodel&outcomeId=6040cf91314829.05893680&grantRef=BB%2FP004628%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/P004628/1","1DCCA903-53B9-417A-8DD6-E722C5BC9359","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","B5BB39B9-0CFA-4514-8973-73C327F59EFE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Database/Collection of data","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BB/P004628/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Williams","Mathew",NA,"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6117-5208",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Advanced technologies for efficient crop management: A participatory approach with application at farm scale","01/01/2017","31/12/2020",410572,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/P004628/1","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","B5BB39B9-0CFA-4514-8973-73C327F59EFE","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

N additions can enhance yield but must be managed efficiently to reduce pollution. Complex process models estimate N status by simulating soil-crop N interactions, but such models require extensive inputs that are seldom available. Through model-data fusion (MDF), we combine climate and LAI time-series with an intermediate-complexity model to infer leaf N and yield. The DALEC-Crop model was calibrated for wheat leaf N and yields across field experiments covering N applications ranging from 0 to 200 kg N ha-1 in Scotland, UK. Requiring daily meteorological inputs, this model simulates crop C cycle responses to LAI, N and climate. The model, which includes a leaf N-dilution function, was calibrated across N treatments based on LAI observations, and tested at validation plots. We showed that a single parameterization varying only in leaf N could simulate LAI development and yield across all treatments-the mean normalized root-mean-square-error (NRMSE) for yield was 10%. Leaf N was accurately retrieved by the model (NRMSE = 6%). Yield could also be reasonably estimated (NRMSE = 14%) if LAI data are available for assimilation during periods of typical N application (April and May).

This has never been done before, and represents a very significant contribution to the fields of environmental science, epidemiology and public health.

We took our inspiration from the ways in which multiple socio-economic deprivation is measured in the UK; via area-level multivariate indices. Such measures identify small area populations with relatively higher or lower socio-economic 'burdens' by combining information on residents' characteristics such as employment status, housing status, material possessions or access to services. These multivariate measures have been successfully used in health research because i) multiple adverse socio-economic characteristics tend to be additive in their effects on health and ii) populations with similar socio-economic circumstances tend to cluster spatially. However, until recently, similar summary measures for physical environmental deprivation have not been available for the UK.",NA,2010,"The data have been used by other researchers in the UK, but have also inspired the creation of similar datasets, in collaboration with us, by researchers in Portugal.","http://cresh.org.uk/cresh-themes/environmental-deprivation/medix-and-medclass/","545ceabf78d249.48383125","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchdatabaseandmodel&outcomeId=545ceabf78d249.48383125&grantRef=NE%2FE008720%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/E008720/1","E7796804-DE97-461F-A0FF-0DE9309EF15A","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","8FA41EEC-F7D2-43E9-B0F5-27DE210D7E10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Database/Collection of data","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/E008720/1","University of Edinburgh","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Scienc","Research Grant","Mitchell","Richard","James",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Exploratory award: Multiple environmental classification of areas for researching spatial health inequalities","02/09/2007","02/11/2007",121352,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/E008720/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","8FA41EEC-F7D2-43E9-B0F5-27DE210D7E10","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Science","College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine"

This dataset can be used to address theoretical questions about plant strategy and trade-offs, trait-environment relationships and environmental filtering, and trait variation across spatial scales, to validate satellite data, and to inform earth system model parameters. 

Main types of variable contained: The database contains 80,827 measurements of 18 plant traits. The most frequently measured traits (&gt;1,000 observations each) include plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf fresh and dry mass, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf carbon content, leaf phosphorus content, seed mass, and stem specific density.

Spatial location and grain: Measurements were collected in tundra habitats in both the northern and southern hemispheres, including Arctic sites in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia, and Siberia and alpine sites in the European Alps, Colorado Rockies, Caucasus, Ural Mountains, Pyrenees, Australian Alps, and Central Otago Mountains (New Zealand). More than 99% of observations are georeferenced. 

Time period and grain: All data were collected between 1964 and 2016. A small number of sites have repeated trait measurements at two or more time periods.

Major taxa and level of measurement: Trait measurements were made on 834 terrestrial vascular plant species growing in tundra habitats. Most observations are on individuals (88%), while a small number represent plot or site means or maximums per species.

Software format: csv file and GitHub repository with data cleaning scripts in R; contribution to TRY trait database (www.try-db.org) to be included in the next version release.

Nematode parasites are of major importance in human health and agriculture, and free-living species deliver essential ecosystem services. The genomics revolution has resulted in the production of many small datasets of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a phylogenetically wide range of nematode species, but these are not easily compared. NEMBASE4 presents a single portal onto extensively functionally annotated transcriptomes from over sixty species of nematodes, including plant and animal parasites and free-living taxa. Using the PartiGene suite of tools, we have assembled the ESTs publicly available for each species into a high-quality set of putative transcripts. These transcripts have been translated to produce a protein sequence resource, and each annotated with functional information derived from comparison to well-studied nematode species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and also other non-nematode resources. By cross-comparing the sequences within NEMBASE4, we have also generated a protein family assignment for each translation. The data are presented in an openly-accessible, interactive database. We have used NEMBASE4 to examine the uniqueness of the transcriptomes of major clades of parasitic nematodes, identifying lineage-restricted genes that may underpin particular parasitic phenotypes, and identify nematode-unique protein families that may be developed as drug targets.",NA,2010,"NEMBASE gene models and analyses are exported widely to other analysis groups including WORMBASE and Nematode.net","http://www.nematodes.org/nembase4/","5460df3c93d706.54024688","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchdatabaseandmodel&outcomeId=5460df3c93d706.54024688&grantRef=BB%2FI023585%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/I023585/1","6D956717-10CC-4E14-B564-685593CACD09","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","F51FAC2E-5696-4D0D-835A-1BCFEA68154A",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Database/Collection of data","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BB/I023585/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Biological Sciences","Research Grant","Blaxter","Mark","Lyon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NextGenPartiGene: next generation transcriptome assembly annotation and exploitation toolkit","31/07/2011","31/01/2013",123949,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/I023585/1","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","F51FAC2E-5696-4D0D-835A-1BCFEA68154A","School of Biological Sciences","College of Science and Engineering"

Using a conventional nickel on calcium aluminate catalyst, operated in bench scale at 1 atm, 400 &deg;C, and with a feed molar steam to carbon ratio of 2, the Low Temperature Steam Reforming of acetic acid, representing a single compound bio-oil surrogate, achieves a promising 81.9% fuel carbon conversion to gases with a methane yield of 15.7 wt% of the feed. This compares to 21 wt% methane yield at equilibrium, thus demonstrating encouraging first time performance and scope for future catalyst optimisation. A comprehensive Aspen Plus model is developed for the first time for an industrial plant producing biomethane from palm empty fruit bunch (50 wt% initial moisture), an underused agro-industrial waste produced in vast amounts in South-East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Dependency on external heating is completely eliminated by heat recovered from combusting 25% of the gas product. Based on the simulation results of the autothermal plant, a final gas product consisting of 99.2 wt% of CH4 and 0.8 wt% of H2 is predicted with a plant thermal efficiency of 80.6%, i.e., comparable to modelled efficiencies found in the literature for wood gasification to biomethane plants that generate syngas as a necessary intermediate.",NA,2019,NA,NA,"74E05A3D4F6","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchdatabaseandmodel&outcomeId=74E05A3D4F6&grantRef=EP%2FK000446%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","DAD8D8F7-42C8-4BDC-8AFA-1F77CC7433B2","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Database/Collection of data","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/K000446/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Research Grant","Gibbins","Jonathan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UKCCSRC - The United Kingdom Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre","31/03/2012","31/12/2015",10127951,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4","School of Engineering","College of Science and Engineering"

"NERC","NE/H024964/1","Research Grant","Research Databases and Models","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Nienow","Peter",NA,"Ice motion measurements, south-west Greenland Ice Sheet (version 2)","From May 2009 to May 2013, seven dual-frequency GPS receivers were deployed along a 120 km-long transect in the south-west of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Two additional dual-frequency GPS receivers were deployed perpendicular to longitudinal ice flow at ~14 km inland: one 5 km distant from June 2011 to May 2013, and another 2.5 km distance from May 2012 to May 2013. Each receiver recorded position observations every 10 seconds or 30 seconds (depending on configuration), enabling resolution of horizontal and vertical ice motion. Sites were powered by solar panels and operated 24 hours a day during summer but shut down in the autumn. Absolute ice displacements at each site were obtained for each summer and winter period in the absence of continuous measurements. Position measurements were kinematically corrected relative to an off-ice base station using TRACK (Chen, 1999). Daily velocities were then obtained by differencing across 24-hour periods, whilst continuous velocities were obtained through application of a sliding 6-hour differencing window.

Automated approaches for image capture and analysis have allowed for substantial increases in the throughput of quantitative growth trait measurements compared to manual assessments. Recent work has focused on adopting computer vision and machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of automated plant phenotyping. Here we present PS-Plant, a low-cost and portable 3D plant phenotyping platform based on an imaging technique novel to plant phenotyping called photometric stereo (PS). We calibrated PS-Plant to track the model plant 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>throughout the day-night (diel) cycle and investigated growth architecture under a variety of conditions to illustrate the dramatic effect of the environment on plant phenotype. We developed bespoke computer vision algorithms and assessed available deep neural network architectures to automate the segmentation of rosettes and individual leaves, and extract basic and more advanced traits from PS-derived data, including the tracking of 3D plant growth and diel leaf hyponastic movement.

Genome sequencing, and large-scale, population genomic analysis, has suddenly become affordable. The explosion of data presents tremendous opportunity for ground-breaking research based on integration of data from independently-organized, community-driven genome projects, but this in turn requires shared database resources. For model organisms, genome databasing efforts grew with the research communities, and there are mature portals for deep investigation across many large scale datasets - the databases themselves have become a substrate for (meta-) research of high impact. For communities new to genomic (and population genomic) approaches, the need for accessible databases is even more pressing, as researchers are less likely to be fluent in the peculiar languages of genomics and in high-throughput bioinformatics. Here we propose the founding of a community database for lepidopteran genomics, LepBase, to meet the needs of the growing community of researchers using genomics to understand Lepidoptera as crop pests, as potentially invasive species, as developmental models, and as key taxa for understanding the interplay between ecology, genomics, evolution and speciation. While initially focussed on the available lepidopteran genomes the project will meet the challenge of future genomic riches (over 20 genomes 'in the pipeline') by building a platform that focuses on the needs of the lepidopteran research community.
The challenge of integrating newly developed genomic resources across taxa is not a new one, and several computational frameworks exist to support such endeavors (such as the ENSEMBL project, and the GMOD ecosystem of tools). Central, aggregative database efforts, such as ENSEMBL Genomes, provide an effective and powerful, one-size-fits-all solution to genome warehousing. Coordinating with smaller research communities to directly implement clade-specific resources is overwhelming the resources of institutions that have a mandate to generate integrated genomic databases. ENSEMBL now advocates a multi-tiered approach to the aggregation, integration, and dissemination of the rapidly increasing wealth of genomic information arising from community-driven genome projects so that species-level genomic resources can flow 'upstream' into the pan-genome database.
The goals of our project are: to develop a community-wide, comparative database for the Lepidoptera using the ENSEMBL platform; to institute effective tools for ongoing community annotation of emerging genomes; to forge close links with ENSEMBL Genomes to ensure upload of lepidopteran genomes into the global resource; to implement new modes of data visualisation and analysis in the ENSEMBL framework to meet community needs; and to provide training in genomics to the community of lepidopteran researchers. The LepBase database will also be a working model of community-driven databases that drive not only clade-specific research programmes but also enable the flow of knowledge from species-specific genome projects into a comprehensive framework.
The project will be based in the Blaxter bioinformatics and genomics group in Edinburgh, in association with the GenePool Genomics Facility (currently engaged in sequencing butterfly and moth species), with project partners in the Jiggins Heliconius research group in Cambridge and Dasmahapatra in York, and the support of lepidopteran researchers worldwide. Initial focus will be on the genus Heliconius, for which a complete genome sequence and abundant annotation, transcriptome and resequencing data already exist. The database will be rapidly extended into silkmoth, Bicyclus, Danaus and other species. The resource will be overseen by a Scientific Advisory Board drawn from across the range of lepidopteran researchers, and will aim for financial sustainability beyond the tenure of the award through development of a 'subscription' model of funding from research partners.",NA,2014,"N/A","http://lepbase.org/","5460dea9a14e73.57588165","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchdatabaseandmodel&outcomeId=5460dea9a14e73.57588165&grantRef=BB%2FK020161%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/K020161/1","4F0BE1A9-9CA7-431C-98D5-C557B5669229","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","F51FAC2E-5696-4D0D-835A-1BCFEA68154A",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Database/Collection of data","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BB/K020161/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Biological Sciences","Research Grant","Blaxter","Mark","Lyon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Building a genome analytic resource for the lepidopteran community","30/11/2013","29/06/2017",534490,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/K020161/1","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","F51FAC2E-5696-4D0D-835A-1BCFEA68154A","School of Biological Sciences","College of Science and Engineering"

The final assembly has a scaffold N50 of 58.4 Mb and a contig N50 of 1.8 Mb, representing a step advance on the previously published C. gigas assembly. The new assembly was annotated using Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq data, identifying ~30K putative protein coding genes, with an average of 3.1 transcripts per gene. Annotation of putative repeat elements highlighted an inverse relationship with gene density and identified putative centromeres of the metacentric chromosomes.

There is a pressing need to identify conserved signalling components among eukaryotes, which will lead to the transfer of knowledge across kingdoms. Two useful properties of a eukaryote model for signalling are (1) reduced signalling complexity, (2) conservation of signalling components. The alga Ostreococcus tauri is described as the smallest free-living eukaryote. With less than 8,000 genes, it represents a highly constrained genomic palette. ## Results ## Our survey revealed 133 protein kinases and 34 protein phosphatases (1.7% and 0.4% of the proteome). We conducted phospho-proteomic experiments and constructed domain structures and phylogenies for the catalytic protein-kinases. For each of the major kinases families we review the completeness and divergence of O. tauri representatives in comparison to the well-studied kinomes of the laboratory models Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and of Homo sapiens. Many kinase clades in O. tauri were reduced to a single member, in preference to the loss of family diversity, whereas TKL and ABC1 clades were expanded. We also identified kinases that have been lost in A. thaliana but retained in O. tauri. For three, contrasting eukaryotic pathways - TOR, MAPK, and the circadian clock - we established the subset of conserved components and demonstrate conserved sites of substrate phosphorylation and kinase motifs. ## Conclusions ## We conclude that O. tauri satisfies our two central requirements. Several of its kinases are more closely related to H. sapiens orthologs than S. cerevisiae is to H. sapiens. The greatly reduced kinome of O. tauri is therefore a suitable model for signalling in free-living eukaryotes.",NA,2014,NA,NA,"c649ea1fbf43d67","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchdatabaseandmodel&outcomeId=c649ea1fbf43d67&grantRef=BB%2FJ009423%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/J009423/1","4D32738B-5C64-4594-80CC-3BBE949F60EB","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","33C89110-F0AF-4CC2-A75F-8C04825EB6E4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Database/Collection of data","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BBSRC","BB/J009423/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Biological Sciences","Research Grant","Millar","Andrew","John","http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1756-3654",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Does an ancient circadian clock control transcriptional rhythms using a non-transcriptional oscillator?","30/09/2012","31/01/2016",769187,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=BB/J009423/1","2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","33C89110-F0AF-4CC2-A75F-8C04825EB6E4","School of Biological Sciences","College of Science and Engineering"

Detailed understanding of the circadian network of higher plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, is hampered by the high number of partially redundant genes. However, the picoeukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri, which was recently shown to possess a small number of non-redundant clock genes, presents an attractive alternative target for detailed modelling of circadian clocks in the green lineage. Based on extensive time-series data from in vivo reporter gene assays, we developed a model of the Ostreococcus clock as a feedback loop between the genes TOC1 and CCA1. The model reproduces the dynamics of the transcriptional and translational reporters over a range of photoperiods. Surprisingly, the model is also able to predict the transient behaviour of the clock when the light conditions are altered. Despite the apparent simplicity of the clock circuit, it displays considerable complexity in its response to changing light conditions.

During ReDAPT, a 1 MW commercial prototype tidal turbine was deployed and operated at the Fall of Warness tidal test site within the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), Orkney, U.K. Mean flow speeds and Turbulence Intensity (TI) at multiple positions proximal to the machine are considered. Through the implemented wave identification techniques, the dataset can be filtered into conditions where the effects of waves are present or absent. Due to the volume of results, only flow conditions in the absence of waves are reported here. The analysis shows that TI and mean flows are found to vary considerably between flood and ebb tides whilst exhibiting sensitivity to the tidal phase and to the specification of spatial averaging and velocity binning. The principal measurement technique was acoustic Doppler profiling provided by seabed-mounted Diverging-beam Acoustic Doppler Profilers (D-ADP) together with remotely-operable Single-Beam Acoustic Doppler Profilers (SB-ADP) installed at mid-depth on the tidal turbine. This novel configuration allows inter-instrument comparisons, which were conducted. Turbulence intensity averaged over the rotor extents of the ReDAPT turbine for flood tides vary between 16.7% at flow speeds above 0.3 m/s and 11.7% when considering only flow speeds in the turbine operating speed range, which reduces to 10.9% (6.8% relative reduction) following the implementation of noise correction techniques. Equivalent values for ebb tides are 14.7%, 10.1% and 9.3% (7.9% relative reduction). For flood and ebb tides, TI values resulting from noise correction are reduced in absolute terms by 3% and 2% respectively across a wide velocity range and approximately 1% for turbine operating speeds. Through comparison with SB-ADP-derived mid-depth TI values, this correction is shown to be conservative since uncorrected SB-ADP results remain, in relative terms, between 10% and 21% below corrected D-ADP values depending on tidal direction and the range of velocities considered. Results derived from other regions of the water column, those important to floating turbine devices for example, are reported for comparison.",NA,2018,"This article is about characterizing turbulent intensities and specifying defined values to different tidal current conditions.

"EPSRC","EP/K000446/1","Research Grant","Research Tools and Methods","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Gibbins","Jonathan",NA,"RAPID","For the UKCCSRC to be truly successful at delivering impact, it must link world-leading research with impact from the outset. The Research and Pathways to Impact Delivery (RAPID) process was carried out to identify areas of research that will form the Centre's core projects. Potential research impacts were considered with reference to the RCUK Pathways to Impact. The Research Councils have grouped impacts into two strands, academic and economic and societal, and these strands provided a general guide for UKCCSRC work on CCS research impact.

The RAPID Process
The RAPID process began with Phase 1, which captured research impacts through UKCCSRC engagement with a wide range of CCS stakeholders. The UKCCSC Biannual Meeting, on 2-3 April 2012, in London fully launched this engagement strategy. This and subsequent meetings, led by the UKCCSRC Research Area Champions, provided well-considered content for Application Impact Tables, which link research areas to levels of knowledge in these areas and to impacts. The research areas and impacts were mapped against the APGTF Report Research and Development priorities (the report is key to the DECC Roadmap for CCS). The results of this community scoping exercise have been compiled and made sense of through production of the first version of the RAPID Handbook, which was launched on 24th July 2012. The RAPID handbook serves to provide the Centre with research requirements for core research activities to be undertaken. 

Revising/Updating RAPID
A series of meetings were held in November 2013 to discuss further RAPID phases, inviting Centre Members to participate in a series of RAPID meetings to review and update the RAPID handbook in light of the forthcoming update to the APGTF Roadmap for CCS. These inputs were included in the RAPID 1.1 Handbook.

Following two stages of development for RAPID with predominantly academic inputs, links have been established with the Centre's Independent Advisory Panel (IAP) and the Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA) Technical Working Group for more targeted CCS practitioner engagement to set priorities and routes for impact.

Real progress in understanding actual CCS deployment issues and the underpinning research required to address them can, however, only be made with the cooperation of the limited number of stakeholders with actual experience of planning and, as time goes on, also executing projects. Progress is therefore related to the rate of CCS market development and the field has seen a significant number of companies leaving since the UKCCSRC project started as well as others joining.

Topical updates, based on links with practitioners, will therefore be undertaken as opportunities allow.

RAPID Phase 2
Just before the UKCCSRC Cranfield Biannual meeting in April 2015 industry representatives from three of the leading post-combustion CCS projects, Peterhead (SSE/Shell), Boundary Dam 3 (SaskPower) and Maasvlakte (EON), met with the IAP and IEAGHG Programme Chair, John Gale, and UKCCSRC academic experts for what is to believed to be a world-first structured workshop on how research activities directed at Phase 2/3 projects for post-combustion capture using amines might be prioritised (i.e. on cost reductions and other criteria). This was intentionally a very well-defined application and one for which the necessary practitioner experience is available. It is also expected (based on subsequently-published ETI analysis) to be a capture application that would be a part of any significant future CCS roll-out to help achieve UK electricity sector decarbonisation by around 2030. Full information on the two-day workshop can be seen at https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/rapid-phase-2.",NA,2012,"The RAPID process is on-going and Application Impact Tables will be further refined through specialist meetings led by Research Area Champions, to provide greater granularity. The RAPID handbook has been used in the assessment of submissions to UKCCSRC Call 1 and Call 2 for research, and is currently being revised by Research Area Champions and the Centre's Independent Advisory Panel, with input from the CCSA.","https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/research/research-and-pathways-impact-delivery-rapid","5464bd9f486eb3.08681753","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5464bd9f486eb3.08681753&grantRef=EP%2FK000446%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","DAD8D8F7-42C8-4BDC-8AFA-1F77CC7433B2","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Improvements to research infrastructure","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/K000446/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Research Grant","Gibbins","Jonathan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"UKCCSRC - The United Kingdom Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre","31/03/2012","31/12/2015",10127951,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/K000446/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","2DA15EF0-6300-4D75-BF93-17D7432E6AD4","School of Engineering","College of Science and Engineering"

This means that researchers are not involved in the linkage process and do not see potentially identifying information. However, in this project we required to link high dimension environmental data (spatially and temporally resolved UV data) numbering many hundreds of millions of records. Without knowing which postcodes existed in the health data and therefore which environmental records needed to be supplied we were required to provide the entire environmental database for linkage. This was challenging due to its size and the time and computing resources needed to link a database of this size this to the health data. Following discussion with the electronic Data Research and Innovation Service (eDRIS) at the NHS we developed a number of changes to the existing system for such linkages. Now, such datasets will be held permanently by eDRIS as part of their standard data holding.

Compact multispectral drone sensors capture high-resolution imagery in visible and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing for the calculation of vegetation indices, such as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) for productivity estimates and vegetation classification. Despite the technological advances, challenges remain in capturing high-quality data, highlighting the need for standardized workflows. Here, we discuss challenges, technical aspects, and practical considerations of vegetation monitoring using multispectral drone sensors and propose a workflow based on remote sensing principles and our field experience in high-latitude environments, using the Parrot Sequoia (Pairs, France) sensor as an example. We focus on the key error sources associated with solar angle, weather conditions, geolocation, and radiometric calibration and estimate their relative contributions that can lead to uncertainty of more than &plusmn;10% in peak season NDVI estimates of our tundra field site. Our findings show that these errors can be accounted for by improved flight planning, metadata collection, ground control point deployment, use of reflectance targets, and quality control. With standardized best practice, multispectral sensors can provide meaningful spatial data that is reproducible and comparable across space and time.

CARDAMOM (CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework) is a computer programme that retrieves terrestrial carbon (C) cycle variables by combining C cycle observations with a mass balance model. CARDAMOM produces global dynamic estimates of plant and soil C pools, their exchanges with each other and with the atmosphere, and C cycling variables for processes driving change. A Bayesian method is used to retrieve model parameters that statistically reduce the difference between model outputs and C observations for each model cell. The outcome is a probabilistic assessment of the fluxes, pools and process variables of the C cycle in each cell.

Why is it useful?
CARDAMOM produces a C cycle analysis consistent with C measurements and climate. It is well suited for using with global-scale satellite observations, for instance aboveground biomass or leaf area index. CARDAMOM produces a confidence interval on all retrieved quantities, so that there is a clear assessment of model-data consistency, and the value of assimilating extra datasets can be quantitatively assessed.

Why is it novel?
Conventional C cycle estimates rely on prescribed C cycle parameters; CARDAMOM retrieves parameters by combining models with data. The implementation of the CARDAMOM family of C models, (DALEC models), differs from typical model implementations: there is no spin-up for biomass and soil C, and no prescribed plant functional types or C pool steady state. CARDAMOM generates maps of key model parameters as an output, rather than as an input. Rather than being compared to data, the CARDAMOM outputs represent the best fit to all data within each CARDAMOM cell.

How does it work?
CARDAMOM has several components. First is a C mass balance model, DALEC, that has four vegetation pools and two dead organic matter pools (these pools can be adjusted to test alternate structures). There are around 20 model parameters associated with phenology (plant timing), allocation, residence times, temperature sensitivity and productivity. The second component is a system to arrange and organise spatial data related to forcing (climate, burned area, management) and to observations for assimilation (currently LAI, biomass, soil C). The third component is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo code, that operates on each model grid cell to retrieve model parameter vectors consistent with data. The fourth component is a structure to manage model-data interactions, distribute jobs to parallel computing nodes, retrieve state and process variables from optimized model parameters, and to summarise results for analysis.",NA,2016,"We have generated publications, begun international partnerships, and been invited to speak about our research tool.",NA,"5c6eaf9a285989.83464690","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=researchmaterial&outcomeId=5c6eaf9a285989.83464690&grantRef=NE%2FK002619%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K002619/1","4D6BF013-631B-4B24-ABB6-9AC8CF1C4F93","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","B5BB39B9-0CFA-4514-8973-73C327F59EFE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Technology assay or reagent","Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NERC","NE/K002619/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Geosciences","Research Grant","Williams","Mathew",NA,"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6117-5208",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Generating Regional Emissions Estimates with a Novel Hierarchy of Observations and Upscaled Simulation Experiments (GREENHOUSE)","31/03/2013","29/09/2017",1190027,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=NE/K002619/1","8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","B5BB39B9-0CFA-4514-8973-73C327F59EFE","School of Geosciences","College of Science and Engineering"

"EPSRC","EP/N021452/1","Research Grant","Software and Technical Products","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Mueller","Markus",NA,"Edinburgh Wave Systems Simulation (EWSS)","The EWST (Edinburgh Wave Systems Toolbox) is a suite of tools for the simulation of wave energy devices. EWST has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies, power-take-off systems, and mooring systems. Simulations are performed in the time-domain by solving the governing WEC equations of motion in 6 degrees-of-freedom.
EWST is derived from WEC-Sim, an open-source wave energy converter simulation tool developed in Matlab/Simulink using the multi-body dynamics solver Simscape Multibody. The EWST is also developed in Matlab, but drops the requirement for Simulink or Simscape Multibody. It also aims to be compatible with Octave, an alternative system able to process much of the standard Matlab code base. The hydrodynamic data format for both is identical, so hydrodynamic data can be easily ported between systems.
EWST replaces the mutlibody modelling parts of the code with MBDyn, an advanced multiboy dynamics simulator. An advanced Matlab code based MBDyn preprocessor is available to allow the creation of MBDyn model input files directly from Matlab. Detailed documentation of the preprocesing tool may be found in it's own dedicated manual.
Purpose
With the existance of Wec-Sim the need for EWST may nt be obvious. EWST addresses several main perceived issues with Wec-Sim.
1. Maintainability: Wec-Sim being heavily based in Simulink does not lend itself to maintenance using standard software version control systems (e.g. Git, Mercurial). Simulink files cannot be easily compared for changes using these systems.
2. Debugability: Debugging a purely code based system is easier than one based in Simulink, as the ability to step through the code and navigate the different levels of the system is more advanced. purely code-based
3. Interface design: The developers of EWST have a different interface design philosophy which is more conventional than the WEC-Sim method. The EWST interface is more oriented toward automation and batch processing than the original WEC-Sim interface. This is mainly to facilitate randomised simulation and optimisation algorithms.
4. Modifiability: Being purely code based, and with all code in one location (rather than spread throughout Simulink models)
5. Cost: WEC-Sim requires many commercial platforms to be operated, EWST can be run entirely on free software (although the performance on Matlab will be superior).
The EWST developers recognise that not everyone will agree with the points above or that they justify the creation of a separate system, but it was these needs which drove it's creation.
An aim of the project will continue to be to maintain compatibility as much as possible between the two systems

"EPSRC","EP/P007805/1","Research Grant","Software and Technical Products","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Wallace","Robin",NA,"Anti-biofouling and self-monitoring coatings","Biofouling protecting coatings on immersed components are intended to prevent barnacles, oysters, tubeworms and other marine life from attaching to wave energy converter and tidal turbine surfaces. Such growth dramatically increases cyclic fatigue loadings and reduces the electricity generated by marine renewable energy devices.

Copper-based paints are usually used as antifouling technology. However, the toxicity of these paints, as well as toxic copper concentration build-up is a major concern, as were the previous organotin paint generation, which led to a worldwide ban in 2008. 

In this project, a new environmental friendly, self-sufficient and embedded system was developed. The developed technology is based on electro chlorination, which have been used for enclosed systems but never to protect large exposed surfaces immersed in seawater. The chlorine species obtained via this method are quickly degraded (half-life of several hours, depending on UV intensity). A low concentration only (0.5ppm) is required for active protection on a targeted surface. This concentration is harmless for humans as it is the same chlorine concentration present in treated water for consumption purpose. The electrical output can be set according to the harshness of the environment. In the event of power failure and uncontrolled fouling the system can be powered up to remove any growth as the production of the antifouling elements are produced at the points of attachment of the growth, the rate of removal can be accelerated by the use of longer pulses and/or higher current. The system is based on a low voltage (6V or lower) for safety considerations, has a very low energy consumption, and can therefore be supplied by renewable energy (e.g. solar/wind).",NA,2019,"Unlike existing solutions, the developed is not toxic and requires low voltage supply and has very low power consumption, making it both environmentally friendly, and very easy to be powered using renewable energy.",NA,"604a2600cf1cd2.34866272","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=604a2600cf1cd2.34866272&grantRef=EP%2FP007805%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/P007805/1","69969E2A-0B77-4FAD-B6DE-8BAB56FB7789","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","9CC11928-89DC-43D7-878F-CA93578BDFEA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"New/Improved Technique/Technology",NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/P007805/1","University of Edinburgh","Sch of Engineering","Research Grant","Wallace","Robin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Centre for Advanced Materials for Renewable Energy Generation","01/12/2016","30/05/2021",2037439,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/P007805/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","9CC11928-89DC-43D7-878F-CA93578BDFEA","School of Engineering","College of Science and Engineering"

"EPSRC","EP/N028198/1","Research Grant","Software and Technical Products","University of Edinburgh","Edinburgh College of Art","Speed","Chris",NA,"Smart Donations app","The Smart Donations App is an ongoing development of this research. Through this blockchain-based app, it allows users to donate money directly to charitable causes with a number of conditions attached upheld with the use of smart contracts.

For example a contract may look like this,

I will donate &pound;100 to an earthquake response fund which will be released if there is a significant earthquake anywhere in the world in the next 12 months. After 12 months, if there has not been an earthquake, then the donor has a number of options;

To withdraw their donation and keep their money
To donate directly to the charity's general unrestricted funds
To renew or create a new contract with the same charity through the app
To create a new contract with a different charity through the app
By working with a number of charitable partners, we are exploring the opportunities and challenges presented by this new approach to giving.",NA,2020,"Based on initial fieldwork and our partnership with Oxfam Australia, we ran a real-world trial of the Smart Donations platform from October to December 2019. We deployed Smart Donations as an Android and iOS mobile app with 86 participants, for up to 8 weeks. Our pilot was highly exploratory. We sought to test the platform, and identify strong use cases and applications from real users and charitable donors. Participants were given limited funds to pledge as they saw fit, to five campaigns that were co-constructed with Oxfam Australia, and leveraging different data sources and conditions.
Earthquake Insurance allowed donors to pledge to donate whenever earthquakes of a specific magnitude and location were detected around the world. Keep Families Together invited donors to donate whenever a petition for government action on refugees was signed by others. Shine a Light on Refugees explored relating giving to politicians and activists discourse on Twitter about topics related to refugees. Fight Climate Change asked donors to pledge funds for climate change projects, whenever extreme temperatures were reached in Australian cities. And the Cyclone Protector contract responded to the emergence and threat of Pacific cyclones - as these were detected, funds could be pledged for disaster response and resilience.
During our short trial, we recorded how donors used the app, collected survey responses and interviewed a number of participants about their experiences. Our analysis of this data is still ongoing, but there are already some key findings. The app produced highly novel and compelling experiences for many donors, but also provided mixed emotions. Contracts were signed with anticipation and excitement, but then when they were triggered and funds were released at unexpected moments, participants reflected on why they were giving, and if this was the right time and the right way to support causes they cared about.
Our participants engaged with the app frequently, and across daily rhythms, often in between other activities as they were notified when their conditions have been met or were expired which meant their money was returned. Some envisaged Smart Donations as an investment platform, where priorities for donations could be set and forgotten, and then pledged funds would be automatically allocated over the course of the year. Others sought and enjoyed frequent engagement with even small donations, and valued an ongoing awareness of world events, and a sense of immediately responding to these events. These experiences were mediated by the conditions, triggers and Smart Donations themselves - with some triggering very frequently, while others were much slower and less active. It's therefore crucial that charities are able to understand, calibrate and communicate clearly to donors how different donations and contracts may play out over time. The pilot in 2019 was the first real world exploration of a data-driven donation framework that leverages emerging blockchain technology and smart contract capabilities to support real-time, automated conditional donations. The Smart Donation pilot in 2019 was the first real-world exploration of a data-driven donation framework that leverages emerging blockchain technology and smart contract capabilities to support automated conditional giving. Through our research, we aim to gain a better understanding of the challenges, stakeholder's expectations and the technical requirements of such systems in particular. More broadly, our work explores the opportunities and implications of situating blockchain and data-driven technologies situated in the space of international aid and opens new directions for future research.","https://smart-donations.oxchain.uk","6228b69d1a7058.89226437","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/resources/outcome.html#?type=softwareandtechnicalproduct&outcomeId=6228b69d1a7058.89226437&grantRef=EP%2FN028198%2F1","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N028198/1","3185E56D-29F0-4D43-B965-F2B9B1895C45","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","ADDE3750-CED3-4CA4-A303-BAD32A0C4A82",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Webtool/Application",NA,NA,NA,"EPSRC","EP/N028198/1","University of Edinburgh","Edinburgh College of Art","Research Grant","Speed","Chris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ox-Chain: Towards secure and trustworthy circular economies through distributed ledger technologies","31/08/2016","31/10/2020",992269,NA,"Scotland","Closed","http://internal-gtr-tomcat-alb-611010599.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/gtr.portal/projects?ref=EP/N028198/1","798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C","2DB7ED73-8E89-457A-A395-FAC12F929C1A","ADDE3750-CED3-4CA4-A303-BAD32A0C4A82","Edinburgh College of Art","College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences"

We have created a prototype (TRL5) and with funding from the Innovate UK ICURe programme (Innovation-to-Commercialisation of University Research), we validated our business proposition worldwide (Sept-Dec 2019). 
Our Earth Blox innovation (US Patent Office, Application No. 62/958,657, 08/01/20) lies in the complete removal of coding skills, making space data accessible to the masses, globally. 

Our vision is to remove the barriers preventing widespread adoption of global satellite data. Earth Blox democratises the power of satellite data and intelligence, by leveraging the power of cloud processing without the need for computer coding or high level Earth-observation expertise. It enables the processing of terabytes of planetary scale geospatial data and the creation and download of actionable insights with unprecedented power and ease. With its unique easy-to-use interface, Earth Blox benefits decision-makers in every sector. 

Satellites and planetary-scale data are available at unprecedented rates of acquisition for solving global challenges, ranging from deforestation, urban expansion and large-scale disaster mapping. Yet, while environmental consultancies, supply-chain managers, insurers, retail and decision-makers in public institutions want to access this information, they are hindered by the complexity, cost and skill levels required to exploit the data - Earth Blox removes these barriers.
