2018,2018-11-12,"Unsuccessful","7410310","improved phosphorus and eutrophication status assessments for humic lakes in light of climate change pressures and departure from eu directive","Phosphorus is an essential component of most living organisms but it can also cause excessive growth of algae in surface
waters even when it is present at relatively low concentrations (10s of parts per billion). This process is called
eutrophication and it is a problem because costly management plans often need to be actioned to restore the quality of the
water, e.g. to achieve good or high status as currently required under the European Union Water Framework Directive.
Recently, it has been observed that phosphorus concentrations in surface waters, especially lakes in upland, organic-rich
catchments, are increasing and this is being linked to climatic change. Firstly, transport from the surrounding catchment is
being enhanced by increased loss of dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus, which is associated with the organic
carbon via bridging links with iron, is co-transferred to the lake waters. Secondly, internal loading of phosphorus in the lake
bottom sediments is leading to increased concentrations in lake waters because of climatic change. This is because
increased periods of stormy weather leads to greater re-suspension of bottom sediments and transfer of phosphorus from
the near-surface sediment porewaters (the water directly in contact with the sediment). It also occurs because there is
increased stratification even in shallow lakes which are a common feature in many upland, organic-rich areas and this can
mean that poorly oxygenated sediments are in more frequent contact with the bottom lake waters. These conditions are
conducive to transfer of phosphorus from the sediment into the lake water.
Although it is known that soluble reactive phosphorus (orthophosphate) is the main form which can be taken up by the
bloom-forming organisms in the water, total phosphorus is the currently used model parameter to determine water quality.
With total phosphorus concentrations increasing, it is likely that more and more lakes will not achieve the required good or
high status. However, we don't know how much of this additional phosphorus is available to aquatic organisms. For
example, if most of it is unavailable, management plans may be enacted where they are not needed.
From an initial screen of the literature, there is a large body of published information from studies in many parts of the world
and from many different disciplines that needs to be critically evaluated and drawn together to address this knowledge gap.
The main aim of this proposal is to carry out a systematic review of the literature and to draw together evidence that will
improve our understanding of the (i) processes controlling the transport of phosphorus from catchment soil to lake water,
and (ii) how phosphorus is cycled from bottom sediments tot lake water, under the pressure of climate change, in organic
rich regions of the world.
The outcomes of this systematic review of the literature will be to inform future research on how climate change will affect
(i) the forms of phosphorus and its associations with natural organic matter in catchment runoff and lake waters and (ii) the
availability of different forms of phosphorus for uptake by aquatic organisms in highly coloured lakes located in organic-rich
regions of the world. This will ultimately facilitate development of more accurate, climate change-proof models for use in
assessing the phosphorus concentration of lakes in carbon-rich zones will be of tremendous direct benefit to the UK's
environmental regulators (e.g. the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) and policy makers
(e.g. DEFRA) and to their equivalent organisations in other countries.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","UK - Research Council","natural environment research council","UNITED KINGDOM","innovation","Margaret Graham","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7410310",NA,99939.71,"62380.60","37559.11",NA,"79951.77","NE/S016023/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Environmental Evidence for the Future 2018","GEO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-01-01,2019-12-31,"David Dougal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Keele University,Partner,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

2017,2018-02-21,"Unsuccessful","6432478","on the politics of hope and fear: utopian tendencies in current debates on climate change","This transdisciplinary project contributes to the critical recovery of utopian thinking and acting by analyzing a major challenge that not only the UK, but the whole world faces: climate change. Climate change is a ""wicked problem"" for which no simple solution can be found. The project asks what future horizon academics, artists and activists imagine when they grapple with climate change. Precisely because the future is radically uncertain and full of risky choices, academics, artists and activists cannot but conjure alternative scenarios some hopeful, others fearful ofwhat is to come. The project's key assumption is that engaging with wicked problems, both in academia and in society at large, inevitably gives rise to utopian thinking and acting. I conceptualize utopianism broadly, as a flexible method, rather than a static end state, comprising both eutopian
and dystopian visions of the future. Furthermore, utopianism contains three dimensions, which deserve equal attention: social
and political theory, art and social movements. Equipped with this multidimensional notion of utopianism, the project pursues two objectives: (1) to excavate the main eutopian and dystopian tendencies in contemporary discussions about climate change; and (2) to work towards a new politics of the future that avoids the pitfalls of both fatalism and wishful thinking. My methodology will be grounded in social and political theory, yet also include approaches from cultural studies and the social sciences so as to paint a holistic picture of the problem under scrutiny. An important output of the project apart from the academic knowledge production will be creation of a deliberative space (the Utopia Lab) in which academics, artists and activists come together to collaboratively reflect on their ideas and practice.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","UK - Charity","independent social research foundation, the","UNITED KINGDOM","fellowship","Mathias Thaler","SOCIAL & POLITICAL STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6432478",NA,51690.21,"51690.21","0.00",NA,"49039.21",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","ISRF Mid-Career Fellowship Competition (MCF4)","SPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-07-01,2020-06-30,"Ina Lindsay",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Unclassified"
2017,2018-02-16,"Unsuccessful","6381947","on the politics of hope and fear: utopian tendencies in current debates on climate change and racism","UTOPIA is a transdisciplinary project that contributes to the critical recovery of utopian thinking and acting by comparatively analyzing responses to two major challenges that the world presently faces: climate change and racism. Despite their differences, climate change and racism share features that lend them to a comparative study: due to their complexity, multi-causality and scope, they constitute “wicked problems” for which no simple solutions can be found. The project asks what kind of future academics, artists and activists imagine when they grapple with climate change and racism. My key premise is that, precisely because the future is uncertain and risky, engaging with wicked problems inevitably gives rise to competing utopian visions – some hopeful, others fearful – of what is to come. I conceptualize utopianism broadly, as a flexible method, rather than a static end state, comprising both eu-topian (better) and
dys-topian (worse) images of the future. UTOPIA proposes to track utopianism in three domains – political theory, arts and social movements – in order to pursue twin objectives: (1) to excavate the main eutopian and dystopian tendencies in current controversies around climate change and racism; and (2) to develop a new account of radical transformation that eschews defeatist fatalism and wishful thinking. My methodology will be grounded in political theory, yet also utilize approaches from cultural studies and the social sciences to offer a hermeneutical, genealogical and critical perspective. Beyond the scientific output, I will create deliberative spaces (the Utopia Labs) where academics, artists and activists can collaboratively reflect on their ideas and practices. UTOPIA’s findings thus aim to improve our understanding of how we (should) reflect on an uncertain, risky future, which will in turn enable theorists and practitioners engaging with climate change and racism to productively interrogate their own work.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - european research council","Mathias Thaler","SOCIAL & POLITICAL STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6381947",NA,1520375.2,"1216300.15","304075.04",NA,"1520375.20",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","ERC Consolidator Grant2018","SPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-07-01,2024-06-30,"Ina Lindsay",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Unclassified"

The core of the project involves a series of workshops, to be held in RMI in February 2017, in which the project team will engage RMI governmental, NGO, educational & community stakeholders in discussions about: 
(a) what is known about RMI's climate change challenges & needs 
(b) what strategies of resilience to climate change impacts already exist within the community, or could be developed in the future.  
Small islands developing states (SIDS), and particularly low-lying coral atoll nations such as the RMI, are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change & sea level rise. RMI faces a variety of environmental hazards (such as typhoons, droughts & flooding), and rising sea levels will increase the risk of erosion, wave inundation & food/fresh water shortages. The RMI government is already planning for the likely relocation of populations on islands such as Kili, a reef platform island that is experiencing increasingly severe flooding, and the trauma of relocation will be compounded by the fact that Kili's residents are an already-displaced population originating from Bikini Atoll, the site of multiple US nuclear bomb tests during the Cold War era.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","natural environment research council","UNITED KINGDOM","global challenges research fund","Michelle Keown","ENGLISH LITERATURE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3481773",NA,167870.02,"146154.17","21715.85",NA,"134296.02","NE/P015816/1","YES","University of Edinburgh","GCRF Resilience Foundation Awards","LLC","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2016-11-01,2017-04-30,"Nisha Patel",NA,"Laura Jeffery, School of Social and Political Science","Meriwether Wilson, School of GeoSciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA

Deep Demonstrations are intended to offer a showcase of a zero-net emissions, a resilient future and highlight the ways that innovation across whole systems can unlock the change we now so desperately need. We want to move toward unleashing exponential change through a systems approach.
The work of INRA, WUR, AgriCircle, the University of Edinburgh and ONFI will be responsible for collecting and curating the learnings and insights from across the different areas in an aggregated way and will be responsible for co-designing the Deep Demonstration ""Turning Landscapes from Carbon Sources to Carbon Sinks"" together with EIT Climate-KIC community. Specifically, the below described tasks and activities will aim to help on co-ordination, implementation and embed the tightly designed and iterative first stage of a four-stage process developed for Deep Demonstrations; namely the Intent with a view to understand the next phase of Frame. Learnings from the co-design approach will be used to roll out systems innovation as-a-service.
INTENT
is the set-up phase of the Deep Demonstrations process. It is designed to establish directionality, to scope needs, vision and objectives for systemic change and ultimately to agree to work together on a Deep Demonstration innovation portfolio focused on catalysing radical transformation of systems.
The key ac􀆟vi􀆟es in this part of the workplan are to:
• Agree who we will work with, on what and why
• Build a shared understanding of innovation as a point of difference that is non-linear, focused on accelerating learning and designed to surface opportunities for catalysing change in systems
• Explore, identify and agree the systems to work on and a vision of structural change to work towards
• Arrive at a joint understanding and agreement as to shared objectives, outcomes, needs, 􀆟me frames and ways of working.
FRAME
is about defining the field for innovation action, building understanding about how innovation might achieve the vision for transformation. This phase is made up of iterative steps that articulate why we want to deploy innovation, where, what to leverage and where to position ourselves to test for emerging, breakthrough
possibilities as well as scaling potential. A portfolio brief that emerges from this stage provides a frame of reference for learning and generating intelligence from innovation.
The key activities as part of this workplan include:
• Articulate where to direct innovation effort and w hy - in relation to what - what to leverage, how and why
• Identify cause and effect relationships, dependencies and opportunities to look for breakthrough possibilities
• Look beyond edges of known to usual actors, outliers, positive deviants and generating opportunities to move beyond defaults, core assumptions and biases
• Identify who could do it, why and where is appropriate
• Framing a portfolio hypothesis described in terms of inn ovation positions.
OBJECTIVES
The main objective of this co-design work is to i) engage highly motivated (a) problem owner(s); ii) identify an initial diverse portfolio of positions, in order to work
thereafter on bold and uncommon experiments; iii) learn lessons from embedding this process which can be used to catalyse further transformation.  Overaching objectives, specific to the needs of the French landscape ecosystem, will be to change organic carbon management in rural landscapes, by exploring with
possibly Planet A as a problem-owner how to increase carbon storage.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","european institute of technology - climatekic (tr)","Ed Craig","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9403208","RE8361",10000,"8000.00","2000.00",NA,"10000.00","191402","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"GEO",NA,NA,NA,"Translational (TR)","NoFlag","No",NA,2019-01-01,2019-12-31,"Ina Lindsay",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)",NA

(SES) on four critical fronts: i) Feedbacks: To understand transitions in vegetation cover, energy balance and cryospheric
change at centennial, decadal, and present-day time scales; ii) SES and biodiversity: To understand the effects of
biodiversity changes on indigenous/local communities and traditional livelihoods, e.g. reindeer herding; iii) Modelling: To
integrate biochemical/permafrost soil carbon exchange, sea ice and albedo into an Earth System Model (ESM), and
incorporate these into the latest Arctic Regional Climate modeling efforts; and iv) Policy: To develop strategies supporting
Arctic communities with co-benefits and synergies between adaptation, mitigation and policy implications. To accomplish
these, CHARTER combines expertise from Earth System sciences, biodiversity indices and SES research. CHARTER is an
ambitious effort to advance SOTA modelling of 21st century Arctic change with major socio-economic implications and
feedbacks for the Cryosphere. We bring together our strongly participatory approaches that incorporate indigenous/local
communities’ ways of knowing regional changes with SOTA research on circumpolar climate dynamics and long-term
palaeoecological studies. CHARTER collates and processes truly transdisciplinary quantitative and qualitative empirical
datasets for a holistic view that can be modeled. Arctic residents and stakeholders work alongside scientists to identify risks
and viable adaptation strategies in relation to projected changes and future resilience in Arctic SESs. CHARTER combines
natural sciences with ESM and participatory approaches to leverage the untapped potential for wild ungulate and livestock
management to regulate global climate feedbacks through biogeoengineering. CHARTER’s results will lead to new tools and
data for implementing sustainable strategies and establish public dialogue on the Arctic.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - research infrastructures","Isla Myers-Smith","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7989814","RE8412",243086,"194468.80","48617.20",NA,"243086.00","869471","NO","University of Lapland (Lapin Ylioposto)","H2020-LC-CLA-2019-2","GEO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-08-01,2024-07-31,"Caroline Barbour",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University College London,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Oxford,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Norges Teknisk Naturvitenskapelige Universitet NTNU,Collaborator,HEI,NORWAY|Helsingin Yliopisto,Collaborator,Industry,FINLAND|Ilmatieteen Laitos,Collaborator,Industry,FINLAND|Universitaet Zurich,Collaborator,HEI,SWITZERLAND|University of Turku,Collaborator,HEI,FINLAND|Eidgenoessische Forschungsanstalt WSL,Collaborator,Industry,SWITZERLAND|Universitaet Hamburg,Collaborator,HEI,GERMANY|Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar- Und Meeresforschung,Collaborator,Government,GERMANY|Universitetet I Tromsoe,Collaborator,HEI,NORWAY|Stiftelsen Norsk Institutt For Naturforskning,Collaborator,Industry,NORWAY|The University of Liverpool,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Aarhus Universitet,Collaborator,HEI,DENMARK|Umea University,Collaborator,HEI,SWEDEN|University of Lapland (Lapin Ylioposto),Lead,HEI,FINLAND",NA,"DDI Tag only","Award Indicative Successful,DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)",NA

2016,2017-03-24,"Unsuccessful","3889365","christianity and nature conservation in britain (circa 1800-1920)","The roles of philosophical ideas, doctrine, ethics and spiritual experience in the origins of nature conservation and
environmentalism have been extensively investigated in North America, but they been subjected to much less scholarly
investigation in Britain and are therefore less well understood. This is particularly so in the case of religious beliefs since
virtually all the extant historical work on the origins of conservation movements in the UK neglects the role of religion
entirely. The received narrative is that nature conservation movements, including movements for public access to open
spaces or 'commons', and movements to conserve 'wild' places or special or 'sublime' landscapes from industrial
developments, such as railways and reservoirs, were driven principally from secular philosophical influences and sources.
Principal among these are said to be humanist and utilitarian philosophy, early scientific investigations of botanists,
biologists and ecologists and the growth of democratic movements and civil society in nineteenth century Britain.
With this research we will provide an accurate and informed historical account of the respective roles of philosophical and
religious beliefs, spiritual experience, and ethics in the origins of British nature conservation and early environmental
movements. Through original primary source research into the principal nineteenth and twentieth century figures in British
environmentalism, we will investigate the role of both philosophical and religious beliefs and institutions, spiritual practices,
and ethics in shaping the leading initiators of conservation and environmental campaigns in Britain in the period of their
birth and infancy from 1800 - 1920.
Our initial investigation will focus on the cultural origins of five specific claims which underwrote the environmental activism
of British nature romantics and conservation pioneers:
1. That human experience of certain 'natural spaces' is morally uplifting and spiritually redemptive, a claim associated with
the idea of the 'sublime', and the belief that sentiments such as awe, peacefulness and wellbeing are provoked by practices
including climbing, walking or riding in certain kinds of mountainous, riverine and forested landscapes (Brady 2015). This
claim was central to the efforts of conservation pioneers to facilitate public access to wild and beautiful places - such as the
Lake District and the Trossachs - as common shared spaces which are protected from industrial or urban development,
and private enclosure (Ranlett, 1998).
2. That the religious ideal of stewardship should inform human uses of natural habitats and protection of common spaces.
Attfield (1992) and Berry (2007) marshal evidence of the Christian religious background of this concept and its potential
role in promoting intergenerational conservation of soils, species and habitats. We will investigate the role of this concept,
and associated practices, in the origins of British environmentalism.
3. That uses of the environment ought to be subjected to critical scrutiny as to whether they will enhance its beauty and
fecundity for future generations or not.
4. That the environment ought to be available for common shared use and not confined to privileged or wealthy uses.
5. That there are natural limits to human uses of the environment arising from nature as a divinely ordered realm which
imposes certain duties of prudence and restraint on its human users.","CAHSS","School of Divinity","UK - Research Council","arts and humanities research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grant - standard","Michael Northcott","SCHOOL OF DIVINITY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3889365",NA,918640.74,"790773.24","127867.50",NA,"734912.59","AH/P015158/1","YES","University of Edinburgh","AHRC Standard Grant","DIVINITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-10-01,2020-09-30,"Sue Coleman",NA,"Emily Brady, School of GeoSciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Nottingham,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Birmingham,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Bath Spa University,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

2019,2020-04-28,"Successful","8494255","air pollution, housing and respiratory tract infections in children: national birth cohort study (picnic)","The aim of this study is to determine the contribution of air pollution exposure during pregnancy and adverse housing conditions (including overcrowding and damp/mould) to hospital admissions for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children under 5 years old in England and Scotland. RTIs are the most common reason for hospital admission in among under-5s in the UK, with 5% of children admitted annually. The relative contribution of air pollution exposure during pregnancy and adverse housing conditions to RTI admissions in young children is unclear, and has not been assessed in a UK context.
We will analyse administrative data birth cohorts including all children born in England between 2005 and 2014, and
Scotland between 1997 and 2019; data from 8 million children in total. These cohorts are constructed by linking data from birth and death registration, maternity systems, and maternal and child longitudinal hospital records. We will further link these cohorts to individual-level Census 2011 data on overcrowding, housing tenure and socio-economic position, and small-area level data on air pollution and building characteristics, to meet our study objectives. These are to:
1) Estimate the association between long-term exposure to ambient AP exposure during pregnancy and the rate of RTI admissions in infancy
2) Derive exposure variables indicating adverse housing conditions (including overcrowding, indoor air pollution, and damp/mould) and estimate the association between housing exposures and infant RTI admissions
3) Based on the outcomes of analyses for objectives 1) - 3), estimate the relative contribution of AP and adverse housing conditions on infant RTI admissions
4) Estimate the relative contribution of AP exposure during pregnancy and adverse housing conditions on RTI admissions in
children less than five years old
5) Establish the enhanced, linked administrative data birth cohorts as research resources for maternal and child health

Drawing on the expertise of our multidisciplinary study team (in health data science, environmental epidemiology, statistics,
geography, buildings engineering and clinical paediatrics), we will exploit the rich longitudinal clinical data for mothers and babies, detailed Census information on socio-economic position, novel linkages to small-area level data.

Our results will inform parents, national and local government, the National Health Service and voluntary sector organisations of the relative contribution of adverse housing conditions and air pollution to common but distressing hospital admissions in young children. The project will inform public health interventions, and empower stakeholders to take action to improve the environments in which children grow up. Our work will also lead to the establishment of national administrative data birth cohorts for England and Scotland, with rich socio-economic and environmental data, which will be
made available to other researchers.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","UK - Research Council","medical research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grant","Tom Clemens","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=8494255","RA5094(School of Geosciences), RA5095(Centre for Inflammation Research)",99163.39,"73615.39","25548.00",NA,"79330.71","MR/T016558/1","YES","University College London","Population & Systems Medicine (PSMB) - Research Boards: May 2019","GEO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-07-01,2022-12-31,"Charis Wilson",NA,"Chris Dibben, School of GeoSciences","Steve Cunningham, Deanery of Clinical Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,"University College London,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - Bayes Centre",NA

increased solid waste generation that creates substantial challenges on solid waste 
management. In India, only 43 metric tons of solid waste is collected annually out of 
which 27.9% waste are treated and 72% waste are dumped in landfill. Landfill gas (LFG) 
is generated owing to the decomposition of solid waste. LFG contains greenhouse 
gases (GHGs) and methane (CH4). LFG emission to the atmosphere without proper 
treatment could increase greenhouse gas emission and has a great impact on global 
climate change. Percolation of water via landfill generates leachate which contains 
complex organic and inorganic contaminants. Leachate treatment is needed for 
protecting subsurface and surface water resources from deterioration. In analogous, the 
effect of solid waste is interconnected with the air, water pollution and spreading of 
diseases.  
The concern on solid waste alone is not enough but focusing direction on LFG and 
leachate management would alleviate pollution that sound well in developing 
sustainable environment for mankind. Among numerous technologies, membrane 
technology is one of the most energy-efficient alternatives for separating LFG and 
leachate treatment. Membrane technology has smaller footprint, low energy 
consumption and eco-friendly than the conventional treatment. The idea of this project is 
to efficiently separate LFG (CO2 and CH4) and leachate using membrane technology. 
Joint collaboration (India and UK)  would aid in transferring skills and technology that 
would promote novel solutions to the existing problem, foster safe environment and 
anticipated outcome would meets the constraints of the scientific, engineering and 
community members. Further, managing LFG and leachate using membrane technology 
would render significance to various environmental developments such as promote

2016,2016-10-11,"Successful","3640609","cleaning the ocean: understanding transport of plastic pollution by waves","accumulated in the world’s oceans with harmful effects on marine wildlife and potentially to human health. Although the scale
of the problem is beginning to be recognized by governments and international organisations, effective policies have yet to be
established to restrict the inflow of plastic debris into the ocean. With plastic particles expected to decay over time scales of
hundreds or thousands of years, it is clear that plastic pollution of the oceans is a persistent, long-term global challenge (UN
Sustainable Development Goal 14.1). Ambitious, innovative engineering solutions to clean the oceans of their plastic pollution
are being proposed by organizations such as the Ocean Cleanup Foundation. Through a combination of offshore and
environmental engineering, fluid mechanics and physical oceanography, this research aims to determine the fundamental
mechanisms of transport and dispersion of plastic pollution in realistic, stochastic seas. Deliverables are simple analytical
expressions for transport and dispersion of particles as functions of the properties of the particle (i.e. size and density), the sea
state (i.e. significant wave height, wave period, spectral bandwidth and directional spreading) and other physical parameters (i.e.
background density stratification, local water depth and the Coriolis parameter). These analytical expressions will be derived
from the governing equations using asymptotic methods, and validated experimentally through collaboration with the
universities of Plymouth (UK) and Auckland (New Zealand), as well as other partners. The proposed research is unique in its
application of a combination of fundamental fluid mechanics, modelling of stochastic processes, identification of user-friendly
solutions using asymptotic methods and experimental validation to address a global challenge. Impact will be achieved through
collaboration with the International Marine Litter Research Unit (Plymouth), Edinburgh Designs Ltd (a UK SME) and the Ocean
Cleanup Foundation.

Aerogel made with the help of nanotechnology and supplemented with organic functional groups can interact with CO2 in dilute gases and attach to them. This way, the CO2 can be extracted from the air and would not be free-flowing. In the past, researchers have focused on a different type of aerogel, which is not regenerated as efficiently. The organic aerogel needs to be improved, as only the organic groups attached to the outside layer are attaching to CO2. I want to find a way of diffusing the CO2 into the aerogel so that the organic groups encapsulated in the gel can interact with the molecule and stop it from polluting the air.","CSE","School of Chemistry","UK - Charity","wellcome trust (rcl)","UNITED KINGDOM","biomedical vacation scholarships","Eleanor Campbell","CHEMISTRY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=8004389",NA,2000,"2000.00","0.00",NA,"2000.00","216982/Z/19/Z","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"CHE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-06-03,2019-07-28,"Samantha Russell",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Application Indicative Submitted",NA

2019,2020-03-19,"Unsuccessful","9778157","greenland's marine terminating glaciers: ocean forcing of glacier retreat and sea level response","Transfer of heat and water between the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and ocean occurs through marine terminating glaciers, their fjord systems and the adjacent continental shelf. GrIS contribution to sea level is increasing due to greater surface and submarine melt and iceberg calving. Current understanding based on observations at several key locations around the GrIS underpins predicted decadal changes in the GrIS and the North Atlantic. However, there remain significant scientific challenges, particularly relating to the exchange of heat and freshwater through the fjords connecting the GrIS and ocean.
Two-way exchange is crucial to the workings of both these systems, and a poor understanding of this transfer and an inability to effectively incorporate it into Earth system models hinders our ability to project future sea level and climate scenarios. Green-MTG will: (1) obtain novel observations from the Gothåbsfjord system in southwest Greenland and the adjacent shelf; (2) develop a new universal ice/ocean fjordic transfer function for inclusion in climate models; (3) use this new universal transfer function to provide improved projections of changes in ice sheet mass loss, sea level and regional oceanic circulation.
The project comprises a program of seasonally resolved observations using autonomous ocean gliders, autonomous underwater vehicles, satellite remote sensing, and a field program using the UK polar research vessel RRS Sir David Attenborough, in coordination with partners in Greenland. It will also utilise databases containing historic data to augment and contextualise the contemporary observations. The project is built around three work packages addressing the marine terminating ice sheet, the fjord and the ocean.
WP1: ""ice marginal processes and freshwater fluxes"" will determine the volume and location of freshwater inputs to the fjords at the grounded submarine ice margin. These are crucial as they drive the fjord circulation which brings warm water from the ocean into the fjord, where it melts icebergs and the submarine ice margin. The rate of sediment deposition at the ice margin will be determined as this can, if sufficiently large, stabilise the ice margin.
WP2: ""Fjordic exchanges and ice sheet loss"" will develop a fjord model expressed as a simple transfer function with location-tuneable constants - modifying the inflow of warm ocean water and the outflow of glacial melt water and icebergs.
This will provide a unique bridge between ocean and ice sheet models. The functional development will draw on data from
a year-long glider mission to investigate the variability in ocean water at the entrance to Gothåbsfjord, and combine this with seasonally resolved observations by our Greenland partners and new observations in the fjord from the research cruise. A key aspect of the transfer function is that it links the freshwater inputs developed in WP1 with the ocean forcing investigated in WP3 thereby quantifying heat delivery to the ice margin via an efficient algorithm suitable for inclusion in climate models allowing projections of glacier retreat and ice sheet mass loss.
WP3: ""Regional oceanographic connectivity and feedback"" will determine the spatial variability in cross shelf exchange
(ocean-shelf-fjord) from Cape Farewell to Davis Strait along west Greenland. This knowledge provides the ocean forcing
for the transfer function in WP2 whereby heat enters the fjord. It will employ a multi-disciplinary approach using a 12-month
mission of two gliders, remote sensing of sea surface conditions, and wind patterns, to characterise water property modification between the shelf break and fjord mouth. These data will be used to ground-truth high resolution numerical modelling experiments which allow boundary currents, shelf edge exchange of water masses, iceberg drift and melt, and their combined effects on the heat and freshwater budgets to be resolved at meaningful spatial scales.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","UK - Research Council","natural environment research council","UNITED KINGDOM","unknown","Peter Nienow",NA,"https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9778157",NA,474670.59,"308723.32","165947.28",NA,"379736.48","NE/V006908/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Highlight Topics 2020 Sixth Round","GEO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2022-01-01,2024-12-31,"Charis Wilson",NA,"Robert Bingham, School of GeoSciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

2021,2021-10-26,"Successful","11682308","environmental sustainability and economic cooperation in the longue duree: a comparative approach to locality, history and development","In recent years there have been multiple challenges to the existing understandings of economic growth and the environment, and the difficulties in balancing economic, social, and environmental goals. There is growing awareness of the challenges posed by climate change and the depletion of natural resources, and the urgency of developing balanced approaches for future economic growth and environmental sustainability. At the same time, the uneven economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the lingering repercussions of the 2008 financial crisis continue to raise important questions regarding social and economic equality, how to manage access to financial resources, and how to protect the agency and opportunity of individuals within a globalized economic system dominated by large multinational corporations. This network seeks to explore and bridge these two issues of our times - sustainable development and economic inequality. In particular, we seek to explore diverse models of economic cooperation and sustainable resource management through comparative and interdisciplinary engagement with historians, anthropologists, political scientists, geographers, and sociologists, with the goal of developing future research agenda into sustainable growth that can incorporate a diverse range of economic, environmental, and social objectives.

Contemporary environmental and economic crises highlight the importance of incorporating a humanistic approach to growth and development that brings to the fore sustainable and equitable patterns of resource management. As such, this network brings together humanities and social science researchers in order to explore the historical and cultural contexts surrounding diverse models of economic cooperation and resource management. In this way, we seek to provoke new understandings of sustainable development, both past and present, while also fostering new collaborations across disciplines and regions in order to highlight the significance of the social and cultural context of sustainable growth. In particular, we seek to prompt new insights and comparative studies into sustainable growth through the example of the Korean kye - a type of organization that has been used to manage a wide range of resources throughout Korean history including forests, fishery rights, education, and financial resources, to name just a few. By bringing examples of Korean kye organizations over time into dialogue with comparative models of economic cooperation and sustainable development from other regions, we aim to generate new directions for future research into alternative models of growth and economic
activity.

Overall, this project will search for links between historically specific examples and contemporary case studies in order to develop a deeper understanding of the interrelations between environmentally sustainable growth and social and economic equality. We will create an environment for interdisciplinary conversations where researchers can learn from one another, while using discussions of kye as a vehicle to expand the understanding of sustainable development and create a foundation for future collaborative research. Throughout this process, we will foster strong ties between researchers in both South Korea and the United Kingdom by hosting a programme of visiting research fellowships and international workshops and conferences that will not only provide a valuable contribution to academic knowledge but also support researchers - especially early career researchers - to develop future research and international collaborations.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","economic and social research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grants","Holly Stephens","ASIAN STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=11682308","R47434",49233,"49233.00","0.00",NA,"49233.00","ES/W011301/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","UK South Korea Connections Grants 2021","LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2022-02-01,2023-07-31,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Durham University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Ewha Womans University,Collaborator,HEI,KOREA, REPUBLIC OF",NA,NA,"-",NA

2020,2020-09-03,"Unsuccessful","10348803","improving plant resistance to environmental stress by targeting deubiquitinases","Plants are essential to sustain life on earth, providing us with food, oxygen and consumer materials we use every day. Human activities have led to the current trend in global warming that seriously threatens plants around the world. Combined with a rapidly growing population, global food security is at risk in the coming decades. More extreme and unpredictable weather events are frequently exposing plants to a variety of stressful environments including fluctuating temperatures, drought, flooding and lack of nutrients. In order to survive it is critical that plants efficiently sense and respond to these damaging stresses. When plants detect stress, they quickly adjust the amount of proteins that are made or destroyed inside cells. This ensures that proteins involved in responding to the particular stress take priority to efficiently prepare the plant for damage limitation. Deubiquitinases are enzymes that control protein destruction and have gathered attention as potential drug targets due to their involvement in many human diseases and disorders. Despite intensive research in animals, our understanding of plant deubiquitinases remains relatively obscure. My previous work has discovered that certain deubiquitinases play important roles in plant responses to different stresses. However, identifying the complete repertoire of stress-responsive deubiquitinases is required if we are to fully harness the potential of these enzymes as targets to improve plant stress-resistance. My proposed research will address this and open doors to future methodologies for increasing crop resilience in the face of a rapidly changing climate.","CSE","School of Biological Sciences","UK - Government","royal society","UNITED KINGDOM","early career/university research fellowship","Michael Skelly","INST OF MOLECULAR PLANT SCIENC","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10348803",NA,699515,"461085.00","238430.00",NA,"571012.00","URF\R1\211530","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"BIO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2021-10-01,2026-09-30,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

2019,2020-05-28,"Successful","9698105","rethinking reparations for african enslavement as cultural, spiritual and environmental repair","This project is based on a series of meetings held in the UK and internationally with community-based, activist organisations and university-based researchers as part of an AHRC research networking project (2017-19) linked to the UN International Decade for People of African Descent (IDPAD, 2015-24) [Reparations for Slavery: From Theory to Praxis, AH/P007074/1]. In this project, we worked closely with two community-based organisations (Pan-Afrikan Reparations Coalition in Europe, UK, and Association Panafricaine pour une réparation globale de l'esclavage, Benin) to create an International Network of Scholars and Activists for Afrikan Reparations (INOSAAR). Our events concentrated on understanding the meaning of reparation and reparative justice from African community perspectives and on finding creative ways to heal the longstanding legacies of African enslavement. We highlighted a lack of research into models of reparation that seek to heal the crimes of the past through cultural, spiritual and environmental means. We noted, in particular, that existing reparative models tend to focus on top-down, state-led approaches that favour the use of the international law courts and monetary repayments. Conversely, we identified the equal importance of bottom-up, community-led models focused on repairing the loss of African culture and spirituality among African descended communities. 

From these findings, we identified two strategic areas for further development and funding, which have yet to receive the attention they deserve within global debates on reparations. The first relates to 'rematriation'; meaning the process by which the descendants of those who were forcibly displaced from Africa as a result of European-led enslavement return culturally and spiritually to the African continent. The second relates to 'planet repairs'; meaning the ways in which the struggle for reparative justice is linked to ongoing concerns with climate change and environmental justice.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","arts and humanities research council","UNITED KINGDOM","follow-on funding (tr)","Nicola Frith","DIVISION OF EUROPEAN LANGUAGES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9698105","RA5685",99993,"83263.66","13161.34","3568.00","80708.00","AH/V006681/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement","LLC",NA,NA,NA,"Translational (TR)","NoFlag","No",NA,2021-06-01,2022-12-31,"Laura Bonsall","Shonagh Mcewan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Boston University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"-",NA

2019,2020-02-28,"Successful","9761928","isp19:environmental stress and telomere attrition; does an enriched post-natal environment have a protective effect on telomere length?","Rapid or excessive telomere shortening during cell division is highly associated with both physiological and mental illness. Due to the role of inflammatory processes in diseases associated with telomere shortening, and correlations between adverse experience and telomere length, it is hypothesised that this is driven by a low level inflammatory feedback loop catalysed by an outside stressor1. 

Numerous studies have investigated the effects of early life stressors on telomere shortening, but little has been done on the effect of positive experiences on telomere dynamics; this study would be the first of its kind in pigs. In our previous work in pigs we have shown a reduced neuroinflammatory profile in juvenile pigs housed in an enriched environment compared to a standard commercial environment. We would suggest that if telomere shortening is related to inflammatory feedback, we will expect pigs housed in enriched environments to experience less telomere shortening relative to those in barren commercial conditions.

This project will focus on the effect of early life (pre weaning) environmental enrichment on telomere shortening in young male pigs (n=96). Associations with maternal factors (age/parity), growth rates and litter size will also be investigated. For a subset of animals (n=30), associations between telomere shortening, environmental enrichment and markers of neuroinflammation can also be examined. 

The data will add to the understanding of telomere dynamics in pigs, and has the potential to develop strategies to reduce excessive telomere shortening in captive animals, as well as being a potential biomarker of an individual’s cumulative experience of inflammatory stress.  This has implications both for animal health and welfare, and, given the pigs emerging importance as an animal model, for translational human health studies.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Research Council","biotechnology and biological sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","institute assessment ispg full","Sarah Brown","ROSLIN INSTITUTE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9761928","RI8036",2880.88,"2880.88","0.00",NA,"2529.41","9761928","NO","University of Edinburgh","Early Career Grant","Roslin",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-01-13,2021-03-31,"Hannah Wheeldon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DDI Tag only","Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 3,DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)","The Roslin Institute"

Whilst these changes have resulted in unprecedented declines in undernutrition, they have come with a cost in terms of environmental degradation and the rising tide of obesity. Today, 1 in 3 people around the world experience some form of malnutrition and dietary risks are the #1 behavioural risk factor for deaths and #2 behavioural risk factor for disability. Our food system is failing us. Transformational action is urgently needed. However, though many theoretical frameworks exist for sustainable food systems, there is very limited data from the field at scale. This is the gap the 'Co-Benefits of Largescale Organic Farming On HuMan Health' (BLOOM) project aims to fill.

The government of Andhra Pradesh in India recently issued an order to support the transition to organic farming across the state known as, 'Zero Budget Natural Farming' (ZBNF). There is currently no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of the ZBNF programme in terms of improving the livelihoods and health of farmers, yet the state government of Andhra Pradesh is moving forward with implementation. The proposed scientific evaluation will fill this critical gap. The Fellow will conduct a natural experiment using population-based surveys of 2,000 rural households in Andhra Pradesh and in the neighbouring state of Telangana (serving as a control) in 2021 (baseline) with two annual follow-up visits (2022 and 2023). Telangana is a unique control given that until June 2, 2014 it was part of Andhra Pradesh. BLOOM will address the following aims: (i) to determine if organic farming has co-benefits on human nutrition and health, and (ii) to ascertain the role of crop yields, household economics, decent work, food security, and diet quality in the causal pathway between organic farming and these outcomes.

More than 50% of stillbirths are currently unexplained and further research is necessary to determine new risk factors for stillbirth and identity pregnancies at risk.  The purpose of this work is to determine how the environment a woman is exposed to during pregnancy affects the health of the mum and the baby.  In particular, we examine these environmental exposures that occur before the onset of labour in an otherwise normally formed baby.  The link between environmental factors such as sunlight exposure, high and low temperatures and air pollution and stillbirth has not yet been studied in depth in a UK population.  However, hostile environments are known to be associated with early (preterm) birth and growth problems in babies.  Data recently produced by our group has shown that sunlight exposure in the first trimester (up to 12 weeks) of pregnancy is actually associated with a lower risk of preterm birth.  In the past, it has been difficult to accurately measure these environmental factors due to difficulty in collecting the information however in this proposal we can link individual level postcode information from health records to corresponding geographical environmental records.   This has been performed successfully by our group previously.  By linking the routinely collected Scottish maternity record, the SMR02, to the baby record (SBR) and the environmental data we will create a database in which we can study the environmental effects on pregnancy outcome.  We can also obtain other key information from this approach about the pregnancy which may mask the relationship we are trying to study such as maternal age, height, weight and information about the baby including birthweight.  Importantly the Scottish birth databases are unique in the UK in that they also give us information on maternal smoking which is a key risk factor in stillbirth and can obscure the relationship between air pollution and stillbirth.  Taking these factors into account when performing the final analysis of the data gives us a more accurate estimate of the association between stillbirth and the environment.

We envisage that the results of this study will improve our understanding of possible risk factors for stillbirth and therefore public health guidance for pregnant women.  The database will also provide a unique opportunity to look at other pregnancy outcomes associated with environmental exposures.  If we find significant associations, the results can be used to carry out further definitive studies to understand these associations and if appropriate trial new treatments, for example in the form of UV light therapy.

2016,2016-11-14,"Unsuccessful","3884047","dynamic- dynamic epidemiological modelling for environmental change: predicting lassa fever disease in west africa","Human infectious diseases are a significant threat to global human health and economies, disproportionately affecting developing countries. The majority of infectious diseases have an animal source (zoonotic), and the dynamics of their spread and diffusion into the human population is underpinned by a complex web of interactions. Computational modelling can play a significant role in prediction of potential threats and evaluation of intervention strategies, yet effective modelling of zoonotic diseases requires an interdisciplinary breadth that is seldom achieved. In this project, we bring together leading computational, epidemiological and ecological expertise to develop a new integrated framework of disease modelling for the important endemic Lassa fever disease in West Africa. Our ambition is to combine ecological models of animal reservoir, spillover and human disease spread in a single probabilistic modelling framework which will enable full uncertainty quantification and prediction. Importantly, our approach will leverage recent developments in the statistical computing community to retain a higher level of mechanistic detail than is currently possible within epidemiological models. This will enable us to provide model-based predictions of responses to a changing environment, and to evaluate the impact of intervention strategies in plausible future scenarios. We will work in close collaboration with the Institute of Global Health at UCL and partners at The Centre for Disease control for Nigeria and the west African hub of the African Union to embed our research into policy and priority setting within the stakeholder communities across west Africa.","CSE","School of Informatics","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","global challenges research fund","Guido Sanguinetti","SCHOOL OF INFORMATICS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3884047",NA,1492589.88,"1331620.03","160969.85",NA,"1218071.91","EP/P028136/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Tackling global development challenges through engineering and digital technology research’","INF","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2017-05-01,2020-04-30,"Asad Nazir",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University College London,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Imperial College London,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund","Institute for Adaptive & Neural Computation"

2016,2016-10-10,"Successful","3769091","data-driven intelligent energy management for environmentally sustainable energy access","This project aims to develop an intelligent energy management
platform and key strategies for the successful transition to a lowcarbon
sustainable society. This will be achieved by integrating smart
technologies – Internet of Things (IoT), Information & Communication
Technologies (ICT), Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and digital
networks for energy infrastructure. The workplan is designed to
realise this through an innovative programme involving UK and Indian
partners with complementary skillsets, mutually enriching, benefiting
both countries.
Key project objectives:
1. A research program on data-driven software technology platforms
for intelligent energy management;
2. Internal and outreaching exchange and dissemination of skillsets
and knowledge

Energy security and sustainable low-carbon economies is the prime objective of climate change
mitigation strategy.India-UK partnership, through UKIERI project, aims to pursue multi-disciplinary
international collaborative research and develop capacity-building to deliver the reliable,
sustainable, affordable green energy society without compromising its economic and social
developments that India as well as UK need. This will also help to promote much greater
decentralised on-site clean energy production and more efficient consumption to satisfy the
potential demand from the two billion Indian people who still lack access to basic modern electric
energy.
The key objective of this UK-India joint research proposal is exchange of skillsets and knowledge
towards the development of a data-driven intelligent energy demand management platform to
accomplish the optimal penetration of low carbon energy-productive economic activity and
energy-efficient end use for sustainable society. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is
the development of a software technology platform -- comprising a set of common knowledge,
theoretical approaches, mathematical models and decision support via optimization and analytical
tools -- that will contribute in making possible the promising environmentally sustainable energy
access. This project proposal include the following objectives:
1) To develop key strategies, novel algorithms and models in order to define interactions of
smart technologies, distributed energy resources, digital networks to enable
environmentally sustainable energy access.
2) To integrate ICT and IoT devices for developing data-driven software tool for real-time
energy monitoring and management.
3) Real-time information management, knowledge-based systems and decision support
development for optimum operations and energy management under normal and missing
information
4) To carry out simulations and tests using laboratory-scaled platform, to test and validate
the most promising solution and provide project outcome.","CSE","School of Engineering","Overseas - Other","uk-india education and research initiative","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Aristides Kiprakis","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3769091","R83674",77700,"77700.00","0.00",NA,"77700.00",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","DST - UKIERI CALL FOR RESEARCH PROPOSALS 2016","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-04-01,2020-12-31,"Janet Ball",NA,"John Thompson, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Institute for Energy Systems"

This project will support knowledge strengthening and institutional capacity‐building at district, provincial and national levels. The project ideas developed through a series of collaborations
(since 2005) among international experts in the project team, a local development foundation in Central Kalimantan (Yayasan Tambuhak Sinta ‐ YTS) and the national, provincial and district governments. The team has past experience in the region with the  UNIDO/UNDP/GEF Global Mercury Project. (See Appendix B for CV of Project Lead and brief bio of other team members.) A scoping
mission was conducted in November 2014 to design this project. Requests were made from the government to support the project. There are four main objectives:
1) Strengthen awareness of environmental and social dimensions of gold mining in 3 districts in Central Kalimantan (Katingan, Kapuas and Gunung Mass), engaging policymakers, larger companies and other stakeholders.
2) Develop strategies for collaboratively implementing the Minamata Convention on Mercury, identifying how treaty implementation could be a pathway for Indonesian authorities and communities organizations to address locally identified challenges (including pollution and deforestation) while strengthening rural livelihoods. (While the project will focus on implementation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, attention will also be paid to REDD – see Appendix A for details of the relevance of this linkage.)
3) Implement and evaluate capacity‐building efforts led by Yayasan Tambuhak Sinta (YTS), to support the Indonesian National Action Plan for the Minamata Convention and promote community‐based development and risk mitigation in gold mining areas. (See Appendix C for description of YTS’s mission, partners and track record.)
4) Develop partnerships for longer‐term collaboration with Indonesian authorities on poverty reduction strategies and risk mitigation in the mining sector.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","Overseas - Other","the canadian international resources and development institute","CANADA","research grant","Sam Spiegel","SOCIAL & POLITICAL STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3048491","R83581",99768.02,"99768.01","0.00",NA,"99768.02","12R23029","NO","The University of British Columbia",NA,"SPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2016-04-01,2019-03-31,"Joanna Wielgo",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The University of British Columbia,Lead,HEI,CANADA",NA,NA,"-","Unclassified"

The concept utilizes the crystallization enthalpy of purely nature-based esters and a
completely new and direct way of high power heat transfer. This reduces the storage to the absolute minimum of storage
material and tank and guarantees a future lowest cost system. To enable this disruptive development, a team of leading
European experts in the fields of latent thermal energy storage, crystallography, demulsification, surface modification and
multi-phase flows will work closely together. Social, environmental scientist and dissemination experts will ensure the
positive impact of this technology to all aspects of society and will create a fertile ground for its future uptake.
BOOMERANG aims to disrupt the decentralized energy storage field by setting the basis for a highly modular solution that
meets the strictest criteria of ecological sustainability, carbon neutrality and safety, while being ultra-compact ( five times
more compact than water) extremely stable (>20 years life-time), and of lowest cost.
Decarbonizing the residential heating and cooling sector is a key requirement to meet the goals of the energy strategy 2050
and to tackle climate change. New energy storages like the BOOMERANG concept will be game changing technologies in
this context. Together with photovoltaic and heat pumps thermal storages will provide the warmth to our future sustainable
houses.","CSE","School of Chemistry","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - future and emerging technologies","Colin Pulham","CHEMISTRY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10180172",NA,299719.61,"239775.69","59943.92",NA,"298279.61",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"CHE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2021-04-01,2025-03-31,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Stiftelsen SINTEF,Collaborator,Industry,NORWAY|Universita Degli Studi di Padova,Collaborator,HEI,ITALY|Universiteit Hasselt,Collaborator,HEI,BELGIUM",NA,NA,"Application Indicative Submitted",NA

Within this remit, the project has five specific goals:
(i) design and engineer a Faraday Exchanger (FE) to industry requirements. The FE is a power-control device that has been created to solve the fundamental technical challenges of voltage, frequency and power-factor control. A small-scale prototype of the FE was launched in 2017 at the National Museum of Scotland and was rated at 3kVA but further work is necessary to develop a full-scale commercial device. 
(ii) test extensively the device based on international/national standards
(iii) demonstrate the functioning of the device in near representative operating conditions, including real-world operation at the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult's test turbine, as well as including an evaluation of wider system impacts, including effects on renewable energy investment incentives, energy prices, and carbon emissions, using a newly constructed investment model based on models developed in previous projects by the academic and industrial partner. The University of Edinburgh contribution to the project focuses on this goal, as well as offering advice on work related to the other goals.

2017,2017-11-17,"Pending","3205901","valuing renewable investment under uncertainty: a real options framework for kazakhstan","Kazakhstan has one of the most energy-intensive economies in the world, and energy demand is still growing. Most of the energy comes from fossil fuels resulting in emissions. The Kazakhstan government adopted an action plan to significantly increase renewable development to meet growing energy demand, reduce fossil fuel use and increase energy security. Renewable energy projects are capital intensive and the returns on investments depend on many uncertain variables, such as energy demand and regulations. Policy makers and the private sector need robust but flexible decision tools to predict these investments. The currently used net present values (NPVs) approach assumes that future decisions are fixed at the start while in reality companies can modify the project according to the circumstances.

Real options (RO) analysis incorporates this flexibility and provides a more useful framework for strategic decision making. However, the RO models requires expert knowledge, the solution is mathematically and computationally challenging, and so NPV is usually used by policy makers and industry. We will develop an RO framework for sustainable energy projects in Kazakhstan, to increase returns on renewable investment and therefore investment levels, and to allow policy makers to more efficiently support the renewable sector. 

The main directions are: 1) understand the main sources of uncertainty for sustainable energy investment in Kazakhstan and formulate RO investment models that capture these; 2) develop methods to solve these types of problems; 3) implement these methods on parallel computers; 4) provide detailed analysis of the results to industry and policy makers. 
Both applicants have strong and complementary skills in probability theory and numerical methods needed to address these topics. Also, the UK applicants have expertise in modelling problems in the energy sector.

According the Energy Roadmap 2050 published by the European Commission the biggest share of energy supply by 2050
should come from renewables. The document specifically mentions offshore wind and ocean energy as renewable
technologies which require further development. Since these technologies are based offshore, in harsh environments,
devices for energy extraction that they use are to be subject to extreme environmental loads and face an increased risk of
failure. At the same time, maintenance and repair of these devices is costly due to their difficult accessibility. Thus, the
reliability of the devices is a critical factor for further development of offshore renewables and their penetration into energy
markets. A typical device of offshore renewables is a complex system consisting of a supporting structure and electrical and
mechanical subsystems. Its reliability depends on environmental loads, performance of its various components under these
loads, interactions between components of the same subsystem as well as different subsystems and interactions between
individual devices within larger arrays. The difficult accessibility of such devices increases the importance of remote
monitoring of their performance. Data collected through the monitoring process needs to be analysed and then used for
updating the reliability assessment of the devices and managing their maintenance and repair activities. These activities
require multidisciplinary knowledge and expertise. Currently, very limited expertise is available in the area of the reliability of
offshore renewables. Building such expertise is an urgent but challenging task. The main aim of the proposed Innovative
Training Network (ITN) is to train a new generation of creative and highly-skilled researchers in the area of the reliability of
offshore renewables, who will contribute to the development of new more reliable devices and the improvement of availability
of operating individual devices and their arrays.","CSE","School of Engineering","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - marie sk_odowska-curie actions","Markus Mueller","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4256016",NA,195205.63,"179777.06","15428.57",NA,"195205.63","766059","NO","University of Edinburgh","H2020-MSCA-ITN-2017 MSCA-ITN-2017 MSCA-ITN-ETN","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-01-01,2021-12-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Jonathan Shek, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Institute for Energy Systems"

2016,2016-11-17,"Unsuccessful","3878121","community grids for resilient, reliable and renewable electricity demand & supply","Developing countries all over the world have long identified the causal link between social and economic progress and the
ensuing improvement of quality of life on one side, with ubiquitous access to electricity on the other. In such countries
large proportions of the population live in remote rural areas with no, or limited connectivity to a power grid. For instance,
in India alone over 230 million people live in non-electrified settlements, while in Nigeria some 95 million people do not
have access to electricity (19% and 55% of the total country population respectively). For these people the dominant
energy source is burning of biomass, providing heat for space and water heating, cooking and lighting in a very inefficient
and environmentally unsustainable way. Essential electrical loads such as refrigerators, irrigation pumps and even
telecommunications, from cellular base stations down to mobile phone chargers are powered by expensive and unsustainable diesel generators. Additionally, moving away from metropolitan areas and towards the remote rural
locations in developing countries, access to knowledge and information via the internet, television and radio broadcasting is
becoming increasingly scarce, which on its own is a major hurdle for the social and economic progress in these areas.
Governments are taking measures towards 100% electrification of their population; India is currently implementing an
ambitious plan for widespread development of solar energy for rural electrification and other countries follow the same
route. However, to maximise their effect, deployment of renewables must be matched with careful planning of
infrastructure and optimal management of demand.
The C-GR3IDS group will work towards addressing the Energy Trilemma in developing countries by designing systems and
processes that will allow sustainable, reliable, and economically viable access to electricity, for both on- and off-grid remote
communities. We will achieve this by using tested, reliable and low-cost system infrastructure, augmented by intelligence
comprising digital technologies informed by real-time and historical data of demand, supply and environmental conditions.
This proposal is aiming to help tackling global challenges through engineering research in sustainable infrastructure
development, and through digital technology research in use of data for vital services. While, due to severity of the
challenge (and therefore the magnitude of the expected impact) in the country, the application of the research will focus on
India, we will strive to ensure that the results are generalised and transferable to other countries in the OECD DAC list with
similar challenges.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","global challenges research fund","Aristides Kiprakis","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3878121",NA,1435939.68,"1251457.68","184482.00",NA,"1171311.74","EP/P029752/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Tackling global development challenges through engineering and digital technology research","ENG","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2017-05-01,2020-04-30,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"John Thompson, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund","Institute for Energy Systems"

Electricity accounts for 25% of UK energy consumption, and corresponding emissions. To keep UK on track to achieve 80% cut in emissions by 2050, 29 GW (35% of total UK capacity) of renewable electricity has been planned for installation by 2020. However, as more renewable energy sources are connected to the UK distribution system as distributed generation, fault current levels increase significantly and become a major barrier to renewable energy integration. According to DECC, up to 45% of planned renewable electricity will be at risk when connected to the existing UK distribution system.

Faults within electrical power systems are inevitable. Typical causes include equipment failure, external damage and severe weather conditions. Very high electrical currents can flow into the fault location, leading to high electrical, thermal and mechanical stresses on distribution system equipment. A power network may run without faults for years, however, once a fault occurs it causes crucial damage and loss not only to equipment, but also to our society and economy. The USA/Canada blackout in 2003 due to equipment failure affected 50 million people and caused economic losses of USD $6bn.

Using an interdisciplinary conceptual framework, out team of electrical engineers, material scientists and physicists will work together to develop a fault current limiter with high temperature superconductors (HTSFCL) to ensure network security when faults occur. This project's main goal is to minimise the usage of superconducting material to (1) reduce cost and simplify cooling system to (2) realise easy maintenance. For example, more than 15 km of superconductor is required for a 35 kV superconducting FCL. Estimated by our pilot research, the new HTSFCL only requires 1/10 of the superconductor.

We will carry out an initial physics study focuses on modelling of the HTS material, which is closely related to the performance of HTSFCL. The reaction of HTS to applied magnetic fields stronger than its critical field will be explored. Based on modelling, a prototype will be designed and fabricated with optimised geometries to minimise the usage of superconducting material while maintaining the current limiting level. Type testing will be carried out to verify its performance and results will be used to validate and improve the numerical model.

This project will complete an ambitious study of ageing and long term behaviour through 200 fault tests, which are equivalent to 10 years of service life. For the first time, ageing and long term behaviour of superconducting FCLs will be able to be analysed in great detail across a large number of tests. The analysis results will be used to identify future technical and material developments, and provide advice on manufacturing improvements.

If we can demonstrate that this technology is effective in limiting fault currents with low cost and easy maintenance, this could be the stimulus for industry to provide mass production, which would enable large-scale roll out of these interventions without government investment. Then we expect that power network operators will start to use it to integrate more renewable electricity and keep the electricity costs down. This will greatly support the reform of the UK electricity market and wean the UK away from imported fossil fuels. This also provides opportunities for low-carbon generators, stabilises the electricity price, and contributes to the challenge of meeting UK 2050 carbon emission targets.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","first grant scheme","Quan Li","SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=2767574",NA,122132.89,"82101.89","40031.00",NA,"97706.31","EP/P021662/1","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-03-01,2018-08-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Institute for Energy Systems"

The CAMREG Centre brings together cutting edge materials researchers who will work together across discipline boundaries to increase renewable energy technology durability, reliability, utility, performance and energy yield. The aim of the Centre would be to combine activity, know-how and facilities from across a wide range of existing fundamental and applied materials science capacity to address the known and emerging challenges in renewable energy generation, including on- and off-shore wind, wave, tidal, conventional and next-generation solar photovoltaics (PV) and energy storage. CAMREG is intended to support and hasten the establishment or expansion of viable and sustainable renewable energy industries in the UK.
The proposed virtual centre offers a wide breadth and considerable depth of materials research capability and capacity in many areas of renewable energy, and is aimed at reducing the overall levelised cost of energy to the consumer. Research areas include: more efficient materials for PV solar and energy storage; materials giving increased power density in electrical generators, improved design and testing of composite blades for wind and tidal turbines; smart materials and optical coatings that can detect early damage in wind blades; smart coatings to minimise erosion and corrosion on blades and offshore support towers; improved lighter-weight design of structural steels; large-scale structural testing of components; better materials fatigue and failure management; lower-maintenance materials with improved resistance to combined wear and corrosion; superconducting materials to transfer power over long distances with less losses; high temperature ceramics and molten salt for energy storage; electrically responsive artificial muscles that can morph the
shapes of wind turbine blades to ensure better energy yields, and can provide better mooring and station keeping for wave
and tidal energy devices.
CAMREG is a partnership of 3 research-intensive universities, Edinburgh, Cranfield and Strathclyde, which would gather and network the interests, capacity and networks of many of the RCUK investments in energy research and training, and accruing over 200 industry connections: through 3 SuperGen Hubs, Marine UKCMER, Wind and Power Networks; 4 EPSRC Centres for Doctoral Training - Wind Energy Systems, Wind & Marine Energy Systems, Offshore Renewable Energy Marine Structures and Integrative Sensing and Measurement; the EPSRC Industrial Doctorate Centre in Offshore Renewable Energy (IDCORE) and the DECC SLIC (Offshore Wind Structural Lifecycle) Joint Industry Project - the largest industry-funded offshore renewables related materials and structures research project worldwide, involving Certification Authorities (DNV-GL and LR) and 10 of Europe's largest energy utility companies. The Centre will also respond to the needs and experience of device developers, project planners, legislators and consenting bodies, and academic partners across CAMREG will continue to work closely with key UK policy stakeholders.
CAMREG will underpin the efforts at existing recognised centres of renewable energy and materials science research, and will encourage those centres to link with new research groups working in complementary areas and to link centres into a coordinated national network. This will have the following national impacts: environmental benefits, through increasing the potential to displace fossil fuels; economic benefit through the expansion of employment and human capacity transfer from the existing offshore energy industries; increased diversity, security and resilience of electricity supply through reduction in dependence upon imported fuel and as indigenous coal oil and gas production declines.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard","Aristides Kiprakis","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=2634440","RA3835 & RA3836 linked to RA4470",2495847.4,"2228167.40","267680.00",NA,"1996677.92","EP/P007805/1","YES","University of Edinburgh","Materials for Energy Technology","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2016-12-01,2021-05-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Andrew Mount, School of Chemistry","Neil Robertson, School of Chemistry","Conchur O Bradaigh, School of Engineering","Ian Underwood, School of Engineering","Eleanor Campbell, School of Chemistry",NA,"University of Strathclyde,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Cranfield University,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"ERI - Business Development Team","Institute for Energy Systems"

2016,2016-12-13,"Unsuccessful","4073170","two phase pumped heat energy storage","Two Phase Pumped Heat Storage (PHS) stores electricity at times when there is over supply of wind or solar at a project cost an order of magnitude cheaper than batteries. PHS differs from previous pumped heat approaches in using unpressurised heat stores, and a two-phase closed-cycle Joule-Brayton machine as the interface between electricity and heat.  Compared with previous PHS, this significantly improves power density whilst reducing cost. The depth of storage can be chosen independently of the power rating, and PHS stores degrade slowly, meeting diurnal or week-long storage needs.  
The applicants propose final storage units circa 100MW with integrated open cycle Gas Turbine peaking and backup plant fitting at the electricity Distribution Network (DNO) level. Facilities would be compatible with siting requirements at existing sub-stations. The materials used in constructing the PHS are non-strategic and fully recyclable with the target cost of rated power at £500/kW, assuming a 10 hour output.
The PHS project will demonstrate and optimize all aspects of the functionality of the PHS in its first 15 months and will build an 80kW prototype unit validating the overall system in the second half of the project. The work program finishes in June 2019, after the demonstration of an operating pilot plant to a target group of customers as part of securing a future business relationship.

compared to the conventional appliances by using energy and water storage in porous materials. Although these
household units may seem an unlikely source of substantial environmental impact, their omnipresence makes them an
important target for further energy optimization and carbon footprint reduction. In fact, the adoption of the proposed
technology on global scale would enable mitigation of the equivalent CO2 emitted by 2.5 large coal power stations. This
project not only offers an opportunity to test emerging classes of porous materials in the context of novel applications, and
understand fundamental issues associated with their application, but also to initiate actual technological deployment of the
outcomes by inviting key international industrial partners.
Nowadays, adsorption materials are produced in massive quantities only when the economy of scale, combined with the
technology readiness level, make profitable their industrial production. This happens only for few specific applications.

2019,2020-06-15,"Pending","10151251","plastic debris impact on fish health, an issue for food security and food safety: focus on digestive, cardiovascular and reproductive abnormalities using molecular and microscopic studies","Water pollution by plastic debris has been found worldwide, but most
prominently in Asia.
Plastic debris can directly affect marine animal health, subsequently
causing a decline in aquatic animal numbers and threatening food security. Contamination of plastics in aquatic animals has further impact on human health due to the toxicity of plastic as well as the accumulation of heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria by plastic.
In this study we will focus on the adverse effects of micro and nanoplastics on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems in fishes. We will focus on Asian seabass, one of the most important economic fish stocks in Thailand and popular worldwide. In the UK, we will use zebrafish as a developmental model for other fishes.
We will observe abnormalities in fishes using microscopic and molecular studies. Molecular studies will be done in collaboration with theThai National Omics Centre. There will be staff exchange between the two research groups and seminars or workshops will be organised in both the UK and Thailand.
Dr Sari Pennings is an expert in molecular techniques and developmental epigenetics mechanisms in disease. Asst Prof Tuempong Wongtawan is currently Head of the Centre for Marine Animal Research and Rescue, and an expert in animal anatomy and physiology. Both have experience from working together to study vertebrate cardiovascular and reproductive systems. This project will also collaborate with fish experts from the University of Stirling (UK), Chulalongkorn University (Thailand), and Mahidol University (Thailand).
The project aims to identify fish health problems, underlying mechanisms, and use in disease modelling, to raise awareness of the danger of plastic debris to the world and human health, to promote collaborative research and development between two countries, to strengthen science and research knowledge, and to propose ways to improve food security and food safety.","CMVM","Deanery of Clinical Sciences","UK - Government","the british council","UNITED KINGDOM","newton funds","Sari Pennings","CTR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR SCIENCE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10151251",NA,78425.81,"52679.12","25746.69",NA,"62740.65","624412056","NO","University of Edinburgh","Newton Fund Impact Scheme","CVS","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance",NA,NA,NA,"ODA","No",NA,2021-02-17,2022-02-16,"Sian Robson",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Walailak University,Partner,HEI,THAILAND",NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","UoE-BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science"

Our attitude towards past events determines our relationship with the built environment because the way we respond to certain buildings, styles and materials is significantly influenced by that building's, style's or material's historical associations. This project proposes that, if this is the case, we can accordingly read responses we encounter in post-war literature to building, styles and materials seen as typical of National Socialism or at odds with it, as a gauge of an author's, narrator's or character's attitude towards the Nazi past. Reading the literature of the period in this way thus promises to yield a more differentiated understanding of evolving attitudes towards the Nazi past in post-war West German society.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","british academy","UNITED KINGDOM","postdoctoral fellowships","Paul Leworthy","DIVISION OF EUROPEAN LANGUAGES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=13332287",NA,361623.58,"208158.62","153464.95",NA,"290498.86","PFOS22\220474","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2023-09-01,2026-08-31,"Jochen Mayer",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

Drawing on the expertise of Gina Luria Walker's New Historia project at the New School, New York, and on the fruitful exchanges arising from Séverine Genieys-Kirk's symposium in 2016, 'Recovering Women's Past', this project will forge a network comprised off our key stakeholder groups: Curators, Creatives, Academics and Educators to explore new ways of investigating and drawing out the lives of women which have been hidden or omitted by official narratives. Curators are important caretakers of under-utilised sources of information. Creatives serve as a key connector to popular memory and culture. Educators are a vital force to enact the change that we seek to ensure that the stories of women's lives are being told and that their voices will be heard by the next generation. Our intention is to draw together stake-holders (curators and academics) who hold or produce useful information on women's history along with creatives who have innovative means of bringing this information to life, encouraging educators to reconfigure curricula to incorporate 'missing matter', and influencing policy makers in the education and heritage sectors. Even in recent times, women continue to be largely absent in the historical narrative; and the knowledge gained by feminist recovery has hardly permeated beyond the walls of universities.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","arts and humanities research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research networking","Severine Genieys-Kirk","DIVISION OF EUROPEAN LANGUAGES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=11819100",NA,43182.5,"27944.47","4258.04","10980.00","36742.00","AH/X006905/1","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2023-01-15,2023-11-14,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The New School,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED STATES|Institut français d’Ecosse,Partner,Government,UNITED KINGDOM|Chawton House Library,Partner,Charity,UNITED KINGDOM|National Library of Wales,Partner,Government,UNITED KINGDOM|The Morgan Library & Museum,Partner,Charity,UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"-",NA

2021,2021-10-26,"Successful","11682308","environmental sustainability and economic cooperation in the longue duree: a comparative approach to locality, history and development","In recent years there have been multiple challenges to the existing understandings of economic growth and the environment, and the difficulties in balancing economic, social, and environmental goals. There is growing awareness of the challenges posed by climate change and the depletion of natural resources, and the urgency of developing balanced approaches for future economic growth and environmental sustainability. At the same time, the uneven economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the lingering repercussions of the 2008 financial crisis continue to raise important questions regarding social and economic equality, how to manage access to financial resources, and how to protect the agency and opportunity of individuals within a globalized economic system dominated by large multinational corporations. This network seeks to explore and bridge these two issues of our times - sustainable development and economic inequality. In particular, we seek to explore diverse models of economic cooperation and sustainable resource management through comparative and interdisciplinary engagement with historians, anthropologists, political scientists, geographers, and sociologists, with the goal of developing future research agenda into sustainable growth that can incorporate a diverse range of economic, environmental, and social objectives.

Contemporary environmental and economic crises highlight the importance of incorporating a humanistic approach to growth and development that brings to the fore sustainable and equitable patterns of resource management. As such, this network brings together humanities and social science researchers in order to explore the historical and cultural contexts surrounding diverse models of economic cooperation and resource management. In this way, we seek to provoke new understandings of sustainable development, both past and present, while also fostering new collaborations across disciplines and regions in order to highlight the significance of the social and cultural context of sustainable growth. In particular, we seek to prompt new insights and comparative studies into sustainable growth through the example of the Korean kye - a type of organization that has been used to manage a wide range of resources throughout Korean history including forests, fishery rights, education, and financial resources, to name just a few. By bringing examples of Korean kye organizations over time into dialogue with comparative models of economic cooperation and sustainable development from other regions, we aim to generate new directions for future research into alternative models of growth and economic
activity.

Overall, this project will search for links between historically specific examples and contemporary case studies in order to develop a deeper understanding of the interrelations between environmentally sustainable growth and social and economic equality. We will create an environment for interdisciplinary conversations where researchers can learn from one another, while using discussions of kye as a vehicle to expand the understanding of sustainable development and create a foundation for future collaborative research. Throughout this process, we will foster strong ties between researchers in both South Korea and the United Kingdom by hosting a programme of visiting research fellowships and international workshops and conferences that will not only provide a valuable contribution to academic knowledge but also support researchers - especially early career researchers - to develop future research and international collaborations.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","economic and social research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grants","Holly Stephens","ASIAN STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=11682308","R47434",49233,"49233.00","0.00",NA,"49233.00","ES/W011301/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","UK South Korea Connections Grants 2021","LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2022-02-01,2023-07-31,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Durham University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Ewha Womans University,Collaborator,HEI,KOREA, REPUBLIC OF",NA,NA,"-",NA

2020,2021-06-16,"Unsuccessful","10932649","reconstructing chinese intellectual history: doctrinal assumptions and exegetical strategies in he xiu’s gongyang commentary","The Gongyang zhuan, a third or second century BCE commentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu, a court chronicle of the state of Lu covering the years 722-481 BCE), has been generally considered the most political- philosophical-oriented canonical text among all Confucian Classics.  In the history of imperial China, HE Xiu’s (129-182) classical annotations to the Gongyang zhuan, a subcommentary titled Chunqiu Gongyang jingzhuan jiegu, has played a dominant role in the exegetical tradition of the Gongyang zhuan until today. Although the orthodoxy and significance of HE Xiu’s 
subcommentary have been widely approved, it has not been examined exhaustively using modern methodologies.

This project will investigate the Chunqiu Gongyang jingzhuan jiegu from several perspectives and attempt to reveal its exegetical characteristics in multiple aspects. At first, a reliable edition of the Gongyang zhuan with HE’s annotations is going to be produced by comparing various xylographic editions of the text and referring to multiple works in the field of traditional textual criticism. On this basis, the exegetical strategies of HE’s commentary can be disserted in multiple aspects. To be specific, HE’s commentary comprises general doctrinal assumptions about the text and develops particular explanations for each textual unit of the Chunqiu forming a systematic hermeneutical approach to the text. By analysing the interaction and connection between the integrated (and sometimes implied) doctrines and the individual explanations, the interpretative strategies of HE’s commentary can be presented, which can be regarded as a quintessential characteristic in early Chinese text interpetation. Besides, the structural idiosyncrasies of HE’s annotations reflect HE’s understanding and redefinition of the structural arrangement of the original textual units of the Spring and Autumn Annals, which will be examined in detail.  Furthermore, the exegetical strategy of repetitions and citations in HE’s annotations will be explored by using the theory of intertextuality. Finally, some of the politically and historically most influential concepts from HE’s commentary, such as the three-generation-theory and the notion of great unification, will be examined in detail within their original context.

In summary, this project is an important attempt to revisit the exegetical tradition of early Chinese text production, reconsider the significance of some central concepts in Chinese intellectual history, and reconstruct a new understanding of the discursive logic of Confucian classical scholarship in the contemporary era.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","british academy","UNITED KINGDOM","newton international fellowship","Joachim Gentz","ASIAN STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10932649",NA,81750,"54500.00","27250.00",NA,"81750.00",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ODA","No",NA,2022-05-01,2024-04-30,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"External Applicant",NA

2020,2021-06-15,"Unsuccessful","10467808","the works of john day: recovered, revived, reconceived","With as many as forty plays, several short poems, an allegorical verse dialogue and a satirical prose treatise to his name, John Day ranks among the most industrious playwrights of the English Renaissance. Day's literary output rivals -- if not eclipses -- those of his more familiar contemporaries, including William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe, John Ford, and John Webster. Day was also no stranger to scandal: he was expelled from Cambridge for stealing a book, murdered a fellow playwright, and so offended the court with one of his satires that the acting company lost its royal patronage. And yet, Day's life and works are little known today even among specialist scholars.

As a much-needed corrective, this ambitious project seeks to recover Day's corpus, to revive those works through performance and by producing the first modern critical edition of them (Day's collected works were last edited in 1881, and that edition falls woefully short of modern standards of scholarly rigour), and to critically reconceive Day's relationship to his literary and theatrical contexts as well as the historical and cultural significance of his life and works, then and now. To achieve these aims, the project will combine innovative techniques of computational stylistics with traditional bibliographical methods for authorship attribution to determine the limits of Day's canon with greater certainty than hitherto possible; conduct a detailed and comprehensive bibliographical analysis of Day's works that survive in early print and manuscript sources; produce the first critical edition of Day's collected works according to modern methods of textual, critical, and historical analysis; mount performances of Day's works, in whole and part, in partnership with acting companies to explore how Day's plays work as texts for the theatre; and produce new scholarship to consolidate, update, and extend criticism on Day, to re-evaluate his works on page and stage, and to offer new models and appraisals of his canon and creative legacy.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","arts and humanities research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grant - standard","James Loxley","ENGLISH LITERATURE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10467808",NA,176903.68,"132544.68","44359.00",NA,"141522.94","AH/W004275/1","NO","University of Leeds",NA,"LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2022-06-01,2027-05-31,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Leeds,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA
2020,2021-06-15,"Unsuccessful","10932590","black ecologies: race and the long anthropocene","My project reads literature at the intersection of race and the environment, repositioning late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Black writers such as Frederick Douglass and Pauline Hopkins alongside contemporary Black authors including Alexis Pauline Gumbs and Marlon James, to demonstrate that many of the problems that define contemporary ecology have always been present in writing about chattel slavery and its afterlives. I ask how Black writing, from the nineteenth-century onwards, reframes the epoch we now know as the Anthropocene, arguing that literature allows us to understand the animating relationship between race and the environment while also providing space to imagine a world outside the joint violence of anti-Black racism and environmental destruction.

I am particularly excited about undertaking this work as it bridges the gap between three disparate conversations occurring in the environmental humanities, Black Studies, and literary criticism. Working at this intersection, my work uses literature as a way to both imagine and build a more sustainable and equitable future. That is, alongside tracing how the same political and economic forces have largely been responsible been responsible for both anti-Black violence and environmental destruction from the inception of chattel slavery to the present, I also look at how literature provides us with the opportunity to imagine a world outside of these twinned cycles. The goal of this research is to not only build a literary archive, but to translate this work into practice, arguing for the importance of literature in constructing alternate futures.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","british academy","UNITED KINGDOM","newton international fellowship","David Farrier","ENGLISH LITERATURE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10932590",NA,90855,"60570.00","30285.00",NA,"90855.00","NIF21\210341","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ODA","No",NA,2022-05-03,2024-05-03,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"External Applicant",NA

2020,2021-03-19,"Successful","10641423","decoding hidden heritages in gaelic traditional narrative with text-mining and phylogenetics","This project will fuse deep, qualitative analysis with cutting-edge computational methods to decode, interpret and curate the hidden heritages of Gaelic traditional narrative. We will provide the most detailed account to date of similarities and differences in the countries' narrative traditions and, by extension, a novel understanding of their joint cultural history. Using recent advances in language technology, we will digitise, convert and make available a vast collection of folklore manuscripts in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. In turn, this new digital resource will catalyse ongoing research into Gaelic speech technology.

The main question that this project poses is: What can a large, digital collection of traditional narrative tell us about historical cultural exchanges between Scotland and Ireland? While we will examine different kinds of traditional narrative, we will concentrate upon International Tales in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. International Tales are folk narratives that are widely scattered across the world, such as Cinderella or Snow White. Some are amongst the oldest known facets of human oral culture, dating back 5000 years or more. Due to their age and their tendency to vary geographically, they can tell us a lot about relationships between different settlements of people. In this study, we use them as a vehicle for understanding early communication networks between Scotland and Ireland, as well as those that existed within each country.     

Through an approach known as text-mining, we will use artificial intelligence to search the tales for similar topics, phrases and other linguistic patterns. The matches that we find between texts will be correlated with what we know about the texts themselves. Using another approach, known as phylogenetic network analysis, we will comb relationships between the texts' themes and the people who produced them: for example, their genders, where they lived and what they did for work. In the end, we will combine the two approaches towards a unified account of Scottish and Irish oral narrative. This work will transform our understanding about Gaelic oral culture and disseminate unique archival material online to a diverse set of end-users. Finally, it will positively impact the sustainability of Gaelic-speaking communities through the creation and further stimulation of important language technologies (e.g. handwriting recognition, machine translation and automatic speech recognition).","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","arts and humanities research council","UNITED KINGDOM","large grants","Will Lamb","CELTIC AND SCOTTISH STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10641423","RA5625  RA5626",398992.88,"294883.34","102309.55","1800.00","319554.31","AH/W001934/1","YES","University of Edinburgh","UK-Ireland collaboration in digital humanities","LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2021-08-01,2024-07-31,"Laura Bonsall",NA,"Bea Alex, School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures","Kirsty Lingstadt, Library and University Collections Unit",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Durham University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Dublin City University,Collaborator,HEI,IRELAND|University College Dublin,Collaborator,HEI,IRELAND|Indiana University, Bloomington,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"-",NA

2020,2020-11-09,"Successful","10498838","new strategies for downstream processing of recombinant proteins","The use of proteins as therapeutics is ever more prevalent. Examples include coagulation factors (such as Factor IIX for haemophilia), enzymes, cytokines and antibodies. There are many advantages to producing these proteins ‘recombinantly’ - introducing the DNA that encodes them into cells or microbes - rather than extracting the proteins from original sources. To produce recombinant therapeutic proteins, they must be purified away from all other cellular proteins. We propose to develop a new tag-based affinity purification strategy, which is readily applicable to proteins produced recombinantly. This new purification strategy will be ideal for downstream processing of protein therapeutics produced by biologicals contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMO), such as Fuji Film Diosynth Biotechnologies UK (FDBK).

Hundreds of thousands of African children are at risk of dying from preventable infections due to interrupted vaccination programs. Furthermore, there is a growing unwillingness of people to seek required medical interventions due to fear and lack of trust, e.g. the WHO reports that mental health patients are avoiding seeking services in hospitals for fear of contracting coronavirus. Therefore, there is a current urgent need for i) recovery of core health system functions in African countries and ii) building confidence in the population for resumption of health-seeking for non COVID-19- related conditions.

2020,2020-09-16,"Successful","10343774","the evolution of sexual dimorphism in recombination rates","When animals and plants produce eggs or sperm, chromosome pairs swap large chunks of DNA in a process called crossing-over. This creates chromosomes that are a mosaic of DNA from both parents which are passed on to offspring. Crossing-over creates new combinations of gene-copies that can be favoured by natural selection. This helps populations adapt faster to new diseases, changing environments and artificial selection. However, too many crossovers can break up good combinations of gene-copies and cause harmful mutations; too few crossovers are a leading cause of infertility. Trade-offs between costs and benefits were thought to tightly constrain crossover rates to a narrow range, yet they show huge variation in nature. Little is known about how and why this variation has evolved.

Sex is strongly associated with crossover rate, with large variation in the direction and degree of sex- differences within and between chromosomes. Hypotheses to explain the evolutionary causes of this variation include sex-differences in selection, selfish genetic elements, sperm competition and mechanistic differences between egg and sperm production, but this question remains unsolved due to a lack of data. My research will use data from 11 wild bird species to measure sex-differences in crossover rates and identify the genes that underlie this variation. I will compare patterns across species to see if they are associated with particular genomic or life-history features and if sex-differences in crossovers evolve slowly or rapidly. This will help us understand if sex-differences are due to selection and/or driven by mechanistic differences between the sexes.","CSE","School of Biological Sciences","UK - Government","royal society","UNITED KINGDOM","early career/university research fellowship","Susan Johnston","INST OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10343774","RA6059",709963.82,"495376.81","214587.00",NA,"589631.05","URF\R\211008","NO","University of Edinburgh","Renewal of University Research Fellowship","BIO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2022-04-15,2025-04-14,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

The bid is backed by the major UK professional cardiovascular societies and the NIHR-BHF Cardiovascular Partnership have designated it as a “COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease UK Flagship Project” (see attached letter). Whilst up to 20% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients may have cardiac injury based on serum troponin (and associated with high mortality), this is non-specific and can relate to pericarditis, myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, acute heart failure, arrhythmias, or simply hypoxia/sepsis/shock. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can make a specific diagnosis and is recommended in European Society of Cardiology practice guidelines. We will use CMR to determine 1) the UK prevalence of acute myocardial injury/myocarditis secondary to COVID-19 and the severity of presentation; 2) how clinical outcomes associate with recognised risk factors for mortality such as age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and coronary/peripheral vascular disease; 3) if there are differences in myocardial recovery at 6 months dependent on demographics, genetics and comorbidities, and how this impacts on patient quality of life and functional capacity; 4) if we can improve the ECG diagnosis of myocarditis minimising the requirement for invasive cardiac investigations. Ethics approval has been granted for clinical CMR scans enabling us to start quickly, and if funded we would extend this approval to include the additional research scans, other investigations, patient reported outcome measures and follow-up as described below.","CMVM","Deanery of Clinical Sciences","UK - Research Council","ukri (formerly rcuk)","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Marc Dweck","CTR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR SCIENCE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10311569",NA,12905,"9907.15","2997.85",NA,"10324.00",NA,"NO","THE LEEDS TEACHING HOSPITALS NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE TRUST","UKRI/NIHR COVID-19 RAPID RESPONSE INITIATIVE – ROLLING CALL","CVS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","Yes",NA,2020-07-01,2021-06-30,"Sian Robson",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Glasgow,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Oxford,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Bristol,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|King's College London,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Manchester,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Imperial College London,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Aberdeen,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Leeds,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|THE LEEDS TEACHING HOSPITALS NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE TRUST,Lead,Charity,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Leicester,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,Collaborator,Government,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"Award Indicative Successful,Covid-19","UoE-BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science"

2019,2020-06-29,"Successful","10042405","developing automatic speech recognition for scottish gaelic","Although Gaelic now has at least nascent representation in several language processing fields and resources,  two cornerstones of modern language technology remain to be developed: a general language model (LM) and an automatic speech recognition system (ASR). If developed, these tools would enhance computer-assisted language learning (CALL), broaden communicative domains (e.g. via interaction with smart devices) and facilitate automatic transcription and translation, addressing multiple desiderata across current research, media and government agendas. 

Our proposal is for a collaborative, 10-month project between researchers at the University of Edinburgh, Quorate Technology Limited and the University of the Highlands and Islands. Once finalised, the Gaelic LM and ASR models will be made freely available on the web, and the study will be documented in blogs and a peer-reviewed publication. 

This project is part of an iterative research programme devoted to developing language technology tools for Scottish Gaelic. It will significantly advance the state-of-the-art, building upon resources and techniques developed in two prior funded projects at Edinburgh University: the Gaelic Part-of-Speech Tagging Project  and the Gaelic Handwriting Recognition Project , and also incorporating two recent spoken language ethnographic recording projects conducted under UHI/Soillse auspices (Saoghal Thormoid and Stòras Beò nan Gàidheal). It is also foundational for an ambitious future research programme, which will develop further novel language technologies for Scottish Gaelic (e.g. geoparsing and sentiment analysis) and innovative ways of understanding traditional narrative through these technologies.  It is envisaged as an initial investigation of an evolving research theme that aims to make vernacular and ethnographic material readily available and analysable for future generations who wish to gain a developed understanding of vernacular speech, vernacular narratives, and vernacular perceptions of their social and cultural condition. Thus, it relies on a strong legacy of innovative research, and will establish its own impactful legacy in subsequent projects.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Universities etc.","soillse","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Will Lamb","CELTIC AND SCOTTISH STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10042405","R46549",19153.1,"19153.10","0.00",NA,"19153.10","Soillse ASR research proposal","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-09-01,2021-02-06,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of the Highlands and Islands,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI)",NA

The objective is to create a package of digital tools – Iunctio – that allows to readily connect and visualise data in the form of social networks, activity maps and graphs of social structure. The development relies on advances made in Iunctio’s pilot project, the Database of Byzantine Literati and the expansion of data included in the BAfunded Prosopography of the Byzantine World (an important but static historical resource). We intend to demonstrate how Iunctio can allow recording people in context and can deploy rich data in different analysis and visualisation strategies.

2019,2020-06-09,"Unsuccessful","9927471","optimising fertility in cancer survivors through novel approaches to assessment, prediction and recovery from germ cell and gonadal damage","The loss of fertility is one of the most important concerns of young people facing a new cancer diagnosis. The field of 'fertility preservation' has developed over recent years, with improvements in egg storage, and freezing of ovarian tissue is now possible. These treatments are however mostly complex, and not all patients either need or can have them. There remain big gaps in our ability to predict accurately who needs to preserve their fertility. Cancer treatments are changing and improving, and we know very little about factors that determine individual's susceptibility to loss of fertility. Our understanding of the effect of cancer treatments on the different cell types that make up the ovary and testis is also limited: improvements in this would allow the development of approaches to prevent damage from happening, and promote recovery after treatment. In this programme we will study the effects of current and new cancer treatments on the reproductive function of teenage and young adult (TYA) males and females who are facing a new cancer diagnosis, recruited from TYA cancer centres across the UK. We will include all diagnoses, allowing us to gather information on the less common as well as more common conditions. We will collect clinical information (including details of treatment received), and blood samples to measure hormones that reflect the function of the ovaries and testes. Importantly, we will start collecting these samples before treatment starts, then again at the end of treatment and at intervals thereafter. This will allow us to determine which treatments do and do not affect reproductive function in both males and females and what pretreatment factors are important in determining this. Over the longer term we will link this to key reproductive eventspregnancy and paternity, and in females, time to potentially early menopause. We will also undertake laboratory-based studies to investigate the effects of cancer treatment on the ovary in much more detail than has previously been performed, using samples we collected from patients exposed to cancer treatment and from laboratory-based exposure of tissue in culture. We anticipate that this will reveal novel pathways of cellular function and communication that are affected by cancer treatment, and this will raise opportunities to identify pathways that could be used for protection of the ovary. We have also developed a unique multi-step method for growing human ovarian follicles and the eggs they contain all the way from the non-growing stage to final maturity in the laboratory. This is a huge opportunity to understand how human eggs grow and mature in detail, never before possible. This method could also potentially be used to grow eggs from ovarian tissue taken from cancer patients before treatment, but where there may be cancer cells within the ovary thus preventing its reimplantation. We need to refine this complex technique, and assess the normality of the eggs we generate from it. We can also use this approach to assess whether normal eggs can be obtained after anti-cancer treatments, or whether there would be concerns about using such eggs. Finally, several labs including ourselves have identified that the adult human ovary contains cells called oogonial stem cells (OSCs) that may have the potential to form new follicles and eggs, under certain conditions. We will explore this by investigating in detail the characteristics of OSCs and the cells that surround them within the ovary, as we think their immediate environment is critical in determining whether they can mature. We have some evidence that one specific form of chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma can activate these cells, but that this is only possible in younger women: we will explore these aspects to understand how and when activation of OSCs may be a way to promote recovery of the ovary after cancer treatment.","CMVM","Deanery of Clinical Sciences","UK - Research Council","medical research council","UNITED KINGDOM","programme grant","Richard Anderson","CTR FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9927471",NA,3049591.68,"2002385.04","1047206.65",NA,"2439673.34",NA,"YES","University of Edinburgh","Population System and Medicine Board (PSMB)","CRH",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","Yes",NA,2021-01-01,2025-12-31,"Mathieu Donner",NA,"Rod Mitchell, Deanery of Clinical Sciences","Chih-Jen Lin, Deanery of Clinical Sciences","Evelyn Telfer, School of Biological Sciences",NA,NA,NA,"Lothian NHS Board,Subawardee,Government,UNITED KINGDOM|University of St Andrews,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-","MRC Centre for Reproductive Health"

Traditional economic data sources have significant latency and coarse granularity making them ineffective for Government use in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. These gaps in economic insight urgently need to be filled. Financial services data sources offer significant potential to deliver timely and highly granular insights of current and future economic impacts.
However these ""new"" data sources need to be rapidly mobilised, safely and securely stored in a way that respects privacy, and subsequently analysed to deliver suitable reports for Government that can then be iteratively refined. Impact pathways will include BEIS, HM Treasury, Bank of England, FCA who are already engaged. This is our raison d'etre.
The project, working with UK Government and data suppliers, has already specified an initial time series of metrics that usefully and robustly reflect the levels of financial health of SME's and consumers across the UK. These metrics will, over the course of the project, be refined to deliver a series of economic, social, environmental and (potentially) health related insights to Government on a more timely basis enabling widespread data-driven, evidence-based interventions.
The project will continue to orchestrate data supply and information demand to maximise impact and optimise interventions in order to pro-actively support economic recovery. The project team hosted at the University of Edinburgh will deliver the insights, comprised of highly experienced professionals from industry and academia including the data supply sector, data scientists, and individual sector experts.
To support long term research we will actively work towards providing longitudinal economic data to approved University researchers which otherwise would not be available.","Professional Services","University Secretary Unit","UK - Research Council","economic and social research council","UNITED KINGDOM","unknown","Kevin Collins","DDI PROGRAMME OFFICE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10027150",NA,1465027.85,"1267177.90","197849.94",NA,"1172022.28",NA,"YES","University of Edinburgh","UKRI Open Call for Covid projects","Uni Secretary",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-06-01,2021-02-28,"Charis Wilson",NA,"Kostas Kavoussanos-Kavoussanakis, EPCC","Mark Parsons, EPCC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Application Indicative Submitted,Covid-19",NA

2019,2020-02-11,"Unsuccessful","9786944","understanding multimorbidity in women: clustering of reproductive health with other morbidities across the lifecourse and underlying mechanisms","There is increasing interest that women's reproductive health problems may be an important, but largely unrecognised, contributor to other physical and mental health problems that women experience across their life. Reproductive health problems are common and include conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome, infertility, endometriosis, miscarriage, heavy menstrual bleeding as examples, but we also know that changes at key time points in a woman's life, such as pregnancy and menopause, contribute to their health. There have not been major advances in understanding how reproductive health problems co-exist with other conditions as reproductive health issues are often not talked about - or are even ignored. This means that no one thinks to connect women's reproductive health problems with other diseases. The situation is made worse as women's health care in the reproductive years is delivered in silos (for example in general practice, sexual health services, gynaecology clinics, maternity care), meaning there are missed opportunities to fully address all health problems that women experience. We believe there are multiple opportunities in a woman's life to prevent other health problems and to empower women with information to take positive steps towards health.

In this proposal we aim to understand the link between women's reproductive health problems and other physical and mental health problems and to explore underlying mechanisms. We propose that inflammation is a key candidate mechanism as there is evidence from the literature that inflammatory pathways underpin some of the common reproductive health disorders and these pathways are also thought to be important in the development of mental health disorders and physical health problems such as heart disease.

In this 6 month piece of work we aim to gather key preliminary data to support our proposal.

To do this we will use existing datasets that contain relevant information about women. These include a large dataset of >600,000 women living in the East Region of Scotland. Their health and social care records have been linked up and anonymised and are held securely. We will use this dataset to identify new 'clusters' of diseases which include reproductive health problems - for example when a woman has more than one reproductive health problem, or when a woman has a reproductive health problem which co-exists with a physical or mental health problem. To find out if inflammation is an important underlying mechanism we will use a large and well characterised study, ""Generation Scotland"". In this study women completed questionnaires about their reproductive health, have had inflammation markers measured in their blood and data about their health and social care has been linked into the main dataset.

During the project we also aim to identify any other new partners who may want to join us to conduct a bigger study in this field. We will also identify other datasets that are available for us to use to answer our research questions.

We have already engaged key members of the public who have an interest in this field in putting together this application. During the project we plan to extend this work. We plan to carry out public engagement activities to get input from women about the topic of our study and what is important to them, and to inform women about our findings.

We will use all this information to prepare and submit a more detailed application to answer the research questions at the end of the project.

Ultimately we hope that our project will pave the way for novel, better targeted, more tailored and effective strategies for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment for women with two or more health problems and new optimised care pathways to improve women's health.","CMVM","Deanery of Clinical Sciences","UK - Research Council","medical research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grant","Rebecca Reynolds","CTR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR SCIENCE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9786944",NA,124265.41,"91600.48","32664.91",NA,"99412.33",NA,"YES","University of Edinburgh","Tackling multimorbidity at scale: Understanding disease clusters, determinants & biological pathways","CVS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-05-01,2020-10-31,"Mathieu Donner",NA,"Andrew Horne, Deanery of Clinical Sciences","Nicholas Mills, Deanery of Clinical Sciences","Sarah Stock, Deanery of Molecular, Genetic and Population Health Sciences","Andrew McIntosh, Deanery of Clinical Sciences","Caroline Jackson, Deanery of Molecular, Genetic and Population Health Sciences","Sharon T Cameron,",NA,NA,"AI Text Flag","Application Indicative Submitted","UoE-BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science"

2019,2019-11-20,"Unsuccessful","9555765","flagg: finance, labour, and the aggregate economy","In the aftermath of the recent global financial crisis, there is widespread acknowledgement that the prevailing macroeconomic models performed poorly, though little agreement on what alternative paradigm should be pursued. But the crisis has served as a kind of “laboratory” which exposes critical features of the economy that are harder to identify in more normal times. By bringing together leading researchers across fields, our project aims to re-examine the foundations of macroeconomics, with particular emphasis on financial and labour markets. Our ambition is bold: we think Europe should beat the forefront of the reconstruction of macroeconomics, and we want to be a key part of that endeavour. In terms of the wider public, we want the fruits of our research to inform and improve the quality of macroeconomic policy.

Financial and labour markets should arguably be the most prominent components of any macroeconomic framework, given that, when things go wrong in the economy, it is the apparent malfunctioning of these markets that stands out most – be it a financial crisis, a rise in unemployment, or both. Behind this research proposal lies the belief that financial and labour markets are connected in ways that economists have yet to appreciate fully. Financial and labour market transactions are most often long-term, and so rely on some form of contract, either explicit or implicit. By looking at both markets through a common lens, by delving into their common contractual foundations, we expect that deeper connections will be discovered that will feed into better macroeconomic models.

To succeed, we need to work across boundaries, to exploit synergies: between macroeconomists and microeconomists, between theorists and empiricists, between experts in finance and experts in labour. We need a broad scope: from small models to big data sets. And we need to embrace wider relevant issues: demography and migration, health and inequality, institutions and regulation.","CAHSS","School of Economics","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - european research council","John Moore","ECONOMICS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9555765",NA,3961436.13,"3169148.91","792287.23",NA,"3961436.13","951535","NO","Centro de Estudios Monetarios y FInancieros","Synergy","ECONOMICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2021-04-01,2027-03-31,NA,NA,"Jonathan Thomas, School of Economics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Centro de Estudios Monetarios y FInancieros,Lead,HEI,SPAIN",NA,NA,"Application Indicative Submitted",NA

Deep Demonstrations are intended to offer a showcase of a zero-net emissions, a resilient future and highlight the ways that innovation across whole systems can unlock the change we now so desperately need. We want to move toward unleashing exponential change through a systems approach.
The work of INRA, WUR, AgriCircle, the University of Edinburgh and ONFI will be responsible for collecting and curating the learnings and insights from across the different areas in an aggregated way and will be responsible for co-designing the Deep Demonstration ""Turning Landscapes from Carbon Sources to Carbon Sinks"" together with EIT Climate-KIC community. Specifically, the below described tasks and activities will aim to help on co-ordination, implementation and embed the tightly designed and iterative first stage of a four-stage process developed for Deep Demonstrations; namely the Intent with a view to understand the next phase of Frame. Learnings from the co-design approach will be used to roll out systems innovation as-a-service.
INTENT
is the set-up phase of the Deep Demonstrations process. It is designed to establish directionality, to scope needs, vision and objectives for systemic change and ultimately to agree to work together on a Deep Demonstration innovation portfolio focused on catalysing radical transformation of systems.
The key ac􀆟vi􀆟es in this part of the workplan are to:
• Agree who we will work with, on what and why
• Build a shared understanding of innovation as a point of difference that is non-linear, focused on accelerating learning and designed to surface opportunities for catalysing change in systems
• Explore, identify and agree the systems to work on and a vision of structural change to work towards
• Arrive at a joint understanding and agreement as to shared objectives, outcomes, needs, 􀆟me frames and ways of working.
FRAME
is about defining the field for innovation action, building understanding about how innovation might achieve the vision for transformation. This phase is made up of iterative steps that articulate why we want to deploy innovation, where, what to leverage and where to position ourselves to test for emerging, breakthrough
possibilities as well as scaling potential. A portfolio brief that emerges from this stage provides a frame of reference for learning and generating intelligence from innovation.
The key activities as part of this workplan include:
• Articulate where to direct innovation effort and w hy - in relation to what - what to leverage, how and why
• Identify cause and effect relationships, dependencies and opportunities to look for breakthrough possibilities
• Look beyond edges of known to usual actors, outliers, positive deviants and generating opportunities to move beyond defaults, core assumptions and biases
• Identify who could do it, why and where is appropriate
• Framing a portfolio hypothesis described in terms of inn ovation positions.
OBJECTIVES
The main objective of this co-design work is to i) engage highly motivated (a) problem owner(s); ii) identify an initial diverse portfolio of positions, in order to work
thereafter on bold and uncommon experiments; iii) learn lessons from embedding this process which can be used to catalyse further transformation.  Overaching objectives, specific to the needs of the French landscape ecosystem, will be to change organic carbon management in rural landscapes, by exploring with
possibly Planet A as a problem-owner how to increase carbon storage.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","european institute of technology - climatekic (tr)","Ed Craig","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9403208","RE8361",10000,"8000.00","2000.00",NA,"10000.00","191402","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"GEO",NA,NA,NA,"Translational (TR)","NoFlag","No",NA,2019-01-01,2019-12-31,"Ina Lindsay",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)",NA

support of its institutions, and for private provision of services outside the NHS. This has taken
several forms: teaching hospital endowments; pooled endowment funds for non-teaching hospitals;
and voluntary fundraising for individual institutions. Voluntary sector provision of health care has
also continued: several voluntary hospitals disclaimed by the state in 1948 continued in existence,
and a number of NHS hospitals have transferred back into charitable ownership.
These contributions to a public health service are little-known and our research is concerned with
the distinctive contribution they make and the challenges they pose for policy. We therefore chart
the scale, distribution and growth of these initiatives, as well as the niches which they occupy. We
analyse how policy has been framed with reference to them – in other words how the balance
between voluntary initiative and central planning has evolved over time – and we explore their role
in innovation in the delivery of health and care, and their importance in engaging the public in
supporting their local services. Overall this research programme provides novel insights into the

progress notes and discharge summaries. It is therefore essential to interrogate free-text data both
clinically for delivering good healthcare services; and scientifically for generating new knowledge about
diseases and medicine. However, manually extracting key medical information is very time-consuming and
costly. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are therefore extensively used to ‘mine’ clinical notes – a
process where a machine ‘reads’ the records and automatically generate structured data. Dozens of AI
algorithms and thousands of free tools are available for mining free-text medical records. However,
choosing the right algorithms/tools and using them confidently to answer a clinical question require AI
expertise and substantial efforts in a trial and error manner. This creates a big barrier to use AI in clinical
settings efficiently and widely.
I will address this broad issue by tackling three specific problems: (1) how to ‘smartly’ reuse an AI tool that
was developed for and excels in a similar task without substantial efforts? (2) how to automatically choose
and combine potentially best-performing AI algorithms/tools to create an effective solution for a clinical
task? (3) how to generate accurate suggestions for clinicians about when to trust and when NOT to trust an
AI (and explain WHY) in clinical decision making?
To answer these questions, I will (a) conduct a theoretical study on what data characteristics associate with
AI performances; (b) create a large-scale across-UK health data testbed; (c) collect a wide-range of AI tools
and investigate their performances on 3 national high-impact case studies within the above testbed. To
empower myself with necessary competence and capacity to deliver this, I will exploit supports and facilities

Consequently, emissions of CO2 are spatially skewed towards cities. Given the important role that cities play in carbon budgets it is crucial we develop our existing
measurement capabilities so that we have data to confidently inform the Paris Agreement global stock takes from 2023. In this proposal we will use ground-based and space-borne sensors to develop data-driven emissions of CO2 from Tokyo and London.

Quantifying city carbon budgets is extremely challenging by virtue of mosaics of CO2 fluxes from anthropogenic sectors (e.g. transportation) and natural ecosystems (e.g. parks). Care must therefore be taken to separate the natural and anthropogenic contributions to city CO2 emissions.

Tokyo is home to more than 13 million people with a population density of just over 6,300 people/km2. London has a population just shy of 9 million people but with a density of approximately 5,700 people/km2, comparable with Tokyo. Both cities are comprised of unique mosaics of anthropogenic and natural fluxes of CO2, with London having more green space than Tokyo.

We will take advantage of the recent installation of ground-based in situ and remote sensing sensors that measure atmospheric CO2 and other related trace gases over London and Tokyo. We will also use new space-borne sensors available from NASA and the Japanese space agency that have city-observing modes.

Our project is a key step towards demonstrating how to report data-driven CO2 emissions from cities.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","UK - Government","royal society","UNITED KINGDOM","international exchanges","Paul Palmer","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9341854",NA,11550,"11550.00","0.00",NA,"11550.00","IEC\R3\193007","NO","University of Edinburgh","International Exchanges 2019 Cost Share (JSPS and MOST Taiwan only)","GEO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-02-01,2022-01-31,"David Dougal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

2019,2019-09-18,"Unsuccessful","9055317","harnessing genomics, pathology tissues and e-health records for earlier detection of cancer and precision medicine","Background: Molecular profiling and digital images from breast pathology specimens of benign and tumour tissues are a rich data resource to identify biomarkers that might improve risk prediction models for early detection of cancer, reduce overtreatment, and define those who might most benefit from targeted treatments. Yet in order to achieve the maximum potential and benefits of such data, population-based studies are needed. 
Aims: Through this fellowship I would aim to develop a retrospective cohort of digital pathology images of benign and tumour tissue samples linked to electronic health records including hospital records, prescription data, screening mammography and cancer treatment to: 1. Identify biomarkers from benign breast disease tissues that are associated with breast cancer risk to allow early detection of cancer 2. Determine if cancer therapy effectiveness (recurrence and mortality) varies by molecular subtypes of breast cancer based on mRNA expression profiling data 3. Define the populations with poorest survival and identify biomarkers that predict survival and treatment effectiveness 
Methods: Harnessing Scotland’s rich tissue biobank resource network and longitudinal population based datasets, we have shown clearly that incidence and mortality trends differ by tumour hormone receptor expression based on 72,217 breast cancer cases diagnosed from 1997- 2016 in Scotland. We have also shown through a proof-of-principle study in NHS Lothian that 80% of breast cancer cases have a tissue sample available through the biorepository from the year 2000 on (where over 650 breast cancers are diagnosed annually). Here we would build a unique retrospective cohort of molecular pathology studies embedded in NHS Lothian. 
How this research will be used: The UK has higher number of cancer cases diagnosed per million of population and deathrates compared to other European countries: strategies to improve these statistics are needed. Cumulatively, this work would provide the data needed to determine how epidemiologic and biomarker data might define those populations at highest risk to improve survival outcomes in the UK and abroad.","CMVM","Deanery of Molecular, Genetic and Population Health Sciences","UK - Charity","cancer research uk","UNITED KINGDOM","senior cancer research fellowship","Jonine Figueroa","CENTRE FOR GLOBAL HEALTH RSRCH","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9055317",NA,1983581.25,"1983581.25","0.00",NA,"1983581.25",NA,"YES","University of Edinburgh","Senior Cancer Research Fellowship","CGH",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-08-01,2026-07-31,"Mathieu Donner",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI - Data Driven Innovation,zDDI-Health_Social_Care","Centre for Global Health Research"

2019,2019-09-03,"Successful","9157790","eco-evolutionary consequences of individual heterogeneity in density dependence","Individuals in a population that are better suited to their environment have more offspring, contributing beneficial genetic variation to future generations. This natural selection allows populations to adapt to changing conditions over time. One important aspect of an individual’s environment is the amount of competition they face for access to resources. If individuals vary in their ability to cope with different levels of competition and this variation has a genetic basis, then the population can adapt to changing levels of competition. However, since the level of competition is a characteristic of the population itself, this generates a feedback loop. This is an example of an ‘eco-evolutionary feedback’ that affects our ability to successfully predict whether populations will increase or decline, and how they will adapt to threats such as climate change and habitat destruction. Despite their importance, we have very little idea how common these feedbacks are in nature because they are difficult to study – they require detailed studies of individuals followed over many decades, along with information on how much genetic material those individuals share. My proposal uses new approaches to study whether individuals vary in their response to population density. I will do this using data from long-term studies of 18 different populations of birds, mammals and invertebrates that have been monitored for up to 73 years. I will test for the presence of eco-evolutionary feedbacks in different species, which will help us to understand how animal populations will cope with changing environments.","CSE","School of Biological Sciences","UK - Government","royal society","UNITED KINGDOM","early career/university research fellowship","Hannah Froy",NA,"https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9157790","RA5646",705877.98,"471687.98","234190.00",NA,"572192.38","URF\R1\201562","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"BIO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2021-10-01,2027-12-31,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"P&M Transition - Supplement Setup",NA

2018,2019-05-01,"Unsuccessful","4188159","linkage of national primary and secondary care data to determine rate, causes and risk factors for epilepsy-related death in adults","BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is an important condition globally, affecting 70 million people worldwide. Although people with epilepsy are subject to the same causes of death as everyone else, they are actually more likely to die because of their epilepsy itself, e.g. when seizures cause accidents in cars or drowning in pools. All such deaths linked to epilepsy are called epilepsy-related deaths. It is thought that many epilepsy-related deaths may be avoidable through, for example, reducing the number of seizures a person has to zero by using medications. This is important because it would mean a person with epilepsy is then no more likely to die than anyone else. Epilepsy-related deaths are therefore the focus of this current project. AIMS: I aim to figure out how many epilepsy-related deaths occur per year, what things cause or make them more likely to occur. METHODS: The study is to be conducted in Scotland and will be enabled by us obtaining information about people's epilepsy and why they died from it from what are called ""administrative health databases"". These are electronic records containing information collected about NHS users, for the purposes of improving NHS care. Researchers like myself can access the information, with a view to learning lessons about disease from it. We have to follow very strict data safety procedures to be allowed to access the information, and great care is taken to ensure confidential information isn't revealed to us. I will obtain information about people who have died with epilepsy from several administrative databases, and combine that with information obtained from their medical records and death certificates. That way, I will build up a more in-depth picture of what may have been the issues that lead to death and what could have been done to stop it. I will use these sources to figure out whether or not death was caused by epilepsy. This will allow me to count up the number of epilepsy-related deaths that have occurred over a seven year period (2009 to 2016) and describe what caused them. In order to figure out what things will have made them more likely to occur, I will compare information from medical records of people who died of epilepsy-related death to information from the medical records of people alive with epilepsy, of a similar age to the deceased when they died. The information from medical records of both groups will be provided to me by the hospital consultants looking after epilepsy. Comparing information about those who died with epilepsy to those who are still alive may highlight important differences, eg differences in how they were looked after. This may teach us important lessons about future epilepsy care. IMPACT: Overall, the study will give researchers a better understanding of how frequently epilepsy-related deaths occur, and what things cause or make them more likely to occur. This information could be used to help set policies to help reduce epilepsy-related deaths in future. The method used (of linking several administrative databases to death certificates and medical records) is unique and could be a helpful method for other researchers to use. The data we have provided could be used by other researchers after obtaining the same data safety training as we have, and therefore the study would help make other people's research easier to conduct.","CMVM","Deanery of Clinical Sciences","UK - Research Council","medical research council","UNITED KINGDOM","clinical research training fellowship postdoc only not pre !!!","Richard Chin","CTR FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4188159",NA,138271,"129819.00","0.00","8452.00","138271.00",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","Clinical Research Training Fellow","CRH",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-09-01,2019-08-31,"Mathieu Donner",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","MRC Centre for Reproductive Health"
2018,2019-04-30,"Unsuccessful","8199007","pig stem cell-derived macrophages as a novel experimental and translational platform for combating economically important pig viruses","Domesticated pigs are a leading source of animal protein for the humans across the world, and accordingly securing the
productivity of pig farming is a global imperative. Currently, commercial pig farming faces severe threats from two highly
transmissible viral diseases, African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus
(PRRSV). ASFV causes a haemorrhagic fever that has a mortality rate of 90-100%, is highly contagious and can be
transmitted directly by contact with infected pigs or pig meat. There is no effective vaccine against ASFV, and the only
assured methods for controlling its spread are strict containment and culling of infected herds; a strategy that has severe welfare implications and very high economic costs. Interestingly, ASFV is endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa where it is
carried by the native wild pig species including the warthog and Red River Hog, animals that tolerate ASFV and act as a
natural reservoir and potent source of virus infection for local domestic pigs. An ASFV outbreak in Georgia in 2007 has
since spread across Europe and Asia, threatening commercial pig production across these continents. Clearly,
understanding the interaction between ASFV and its hosts and experimental systems to test effective counter-measures,
such as vaccines, are urgently required to control the spread of ASFV.
In comparison with ASFV, PRRSV is less virulent, but is widespread in commercial pig herds causing abortions in pregnant
sows, high morbidity and mortality in piglets, and is currently the most economically important virus pathogen in pig farming
- costing > 1 billion Euros annually in Europe. Combating PRRSV infection is therefore a critical issue for commercial pig
farming.
The preferred cellular host for ASFV and PRRSV is the pig macrophage, a white blood cell that is the first line defence
against infections. Existing culture systems for studying ASFV or PRRSV rely either on primary macrophage cultures
prepared from pigs or immortalised cell lines - both of which have significant limitations. We have recently developed a
novel pig cell culture model in which we convert pig stem cell lines into normal macrophages. These pig stem cells can be
propagated in large numbers, can be genetically modified, and can be induced as needed into cultures that produce
macrophages for 6-8 weeks. These cultured macrophages exhibit the key characteristics of the equivalent cells isolated
from pigs, including expression of macrophage specific genes, ingestion of bacterial particles and infection by macrophage
pathogens. In parallel we have generated stem cell lines from the ASFV tolerant Red River Hog - and also produced
macrophages from this wild pig. Importantly, our initial experiments indicate that macrophages from the African pig exhibit
greater tolerance to ASFV, compared with the cells derived from the domestic pig, mirroring the response in the two types
of pigs.
In this proposal we will characterise this unique new cell culture system, directly comparing ASFV and PRRSV infection in
the macrophages of domestic and the Red River Hog. The proposal has two main objectives: 1) To investigate the
molecular basis of why Red River Hogs are resilient to ASFV, by comparing how domestic pig and Red River Hog cultured
macrophages respond to ASFV (and PRRSV) infection; and 2) To develop cultured macrophage production for larger
scale, high through-put assays and vaccine propagation.
The development of this novel cell culture system has potential relevance for devising strategies for combating the spread
of ASFV and PRRSV in commercial pig herds, in particular the development and propagation of effective vaccines. The
approach also has a broader relevance and applications in livestock research for improving farming efficiency generally,
has implications for livestock welfare and is clearly in accordance with 3R objectives to reduce, refine and replace animals
in research.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Research Council","biotechnology and biological sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","responsive mode","Tom Burdon","ROSLIN INSTITUTE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=8199007",NA,634236.84,"466045.83","168191.00",NA,"507389.47",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"Roslin",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-01-01,2022-12-31,"Natasha Curley",NA,"Christine Tait-Burkard, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Pirbright Institute,Collaborator,Charity,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 1,DDI - Data Driven Innovation","The Roslin Institute"
2018,2019-04-29,"Successful","5763539","effect and interaction of mutation and recombination in the dynamics of genetic variation in modern chickens","Resolving how genetic variation is maintained in closed populations under directional selection is one of the fundamental,
yet still open questions in quantitative genetics. Addressing this question has also vital implications for the sustainability of
genetic improvement programmes that underpin global staple food production systems. Considerable research effort has
focused on studying how selection reduces genetic variation and how its footprint can be identified in the genome. Little
effort has been placed to study how genetic variation is de-novo created and shuffled across generations. The reason is
that until now, it was not feasible to track mutation, the evolutionary force creating new genetic variation, on the large-scale
that analysis required, due to technological and economic constraints. The only option available to geneticists was to rely
on low precision estimates for the mutation rate, since they mostly arose from small scale studies in experimental populations. These parameters then would be used in models aiming to describe the dynamics of genetic variation, which
were based on many theoretical assumptions due to lack of data on the observed rate of mutation. The uncertainty of the
parameters used, combined with our limited understanding of the interplay of forces on standing variation, reduce the
power of our current models to capture the underlying processes and therefore, explain why ""there is still no clear
resolution on the evolutionary forces responsible for the maintenance of variation"", as one of the gold standard textbooks in
Quantitative Genetics (Lynch and Walsh, 2018) emphatically states.
The main hypothesis of this proposal is that the rate of creation and shuffling of genetic variation is sufficient to
counterbalance the effect of selection, genetic drift and inbreeding in finite closed populations. Our goal is to take a datadriven approach to quantify with unprecedented accuracy the mutation and recombination processes that could explain
how genetic variation appears to be maintained in closed populations that are under intense directional selection. To
achieve this aim, we will use a unique genomic repository consisting of hundreds of thousands of birds (either sequenced
in high-depth or genotyped with SNP arrays) extending over 25 generations with full pedigree and phenotypic information
to study how genetic variation is maintained over time. This dataset gives us the required power to precisely estimate
important parameters, such as how many mutational events occur per generation, where they tend to occur across the
genome, and how the new genetic variation due to mutation balances its removal. As our data extend over many
generations, we will have the power to track both mutations and haplotypes through the pedigree in order to remove false
positive observations that can inflate estimates. Our study will also focus on quantifying recombination, as the force
shuffling genetic variation, and we will explore its interplay with mutation. Finally, we will apply our more precise estimates
to update theoretical expectations on where selection limits may lay aiming to reconcile theoretical predictions and

More than 50% of stillbirths are currently unexplained and further research is necessary to determine new risk factors for stillbirth and identity pregnancies at risk.  The purpose of this work is to determine how the environment a woman is exposed to during pregnancy affects the health of the mum and the baby.  In particular, we examine these environmental exposures that occur before the onset of labour in an otherwise normally formed baby.  The link between environmental factors such as sunlight exposure, high and low temperatures and air pollution and stillbirth has not yet been studied in depth in a UK population.  However, hostile environments are known to be associated with early (preterm) birth and growth problems in babies.  Data recently produced by our group has shown that sunlight exposure in the first trimester (up to 12 weeks) of pregnancy is actually associated with a lower risk of preterm birth.  In the past, it has been difficult to accurately measure these environmental factors due to difficulty in collecting the information however in this proposal we can link individual level postcode information from health records to corresponding geographical environmental records.   This has been performed successfully by our group previously.  By linking the routinely collected Scottish maternity record, the SMR02, to the baby record (SBR) and the environmental data we will create a database in which we can study the environmental effects on pregnancy outcome.  We can also obtain other key information from this approach about the pregnancy which may mask the relationship we are trying to study such as maternal age, height, weight and information about the baby including birthweight.  Importantly the Scottish birth databases are unique in the UK in that they also give us information on maternal smoking which is a key risk factor in stillbirth and can obscure the relationship between air pollution and stillbirth.  Taking these factors into account when performing the final analysis of the data gives us a more accurate estimate of the association between stillbirth and the environment.

We envisage that the results of this study will improve our understanding of possible risk factors for stillbirth and therefore public health guidance for pregnant women.  The database will also provide a unique opportunity to look at other pregnancy outcomes associated with environmental exposures.  If we find significant associations, the results can be used to carry out further definitive studies to understand these associations and if appropriate trial new treatments, for example in the form of UV light therapy.

The results of this study will be used to inform policymakers and clinicians by providing information on risk factors for stillbirth, identify pregnancies at high risk of stillbirth and providing guidance on optimal management to try to reduce fetal death and complications.","CMVM","Deanery of Clinical Sciences","UK - Charity","stillbirth and neonatal death charity","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Sarah Murray","CTR FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=8215430",NA,22290.56,"22290.56","0.00",NA,"22290.56",NA,"YES","University of Edinburgh","SANDS Research Fund Outline","CRH",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","Yes",NA,2023-01-04,2024-01-31,"Jack Thorburn",NA,"Jane Norman, Deanery of Clinical Sciences","Chris Dibben, School of GeoSciences","Sarah Stock, Deanery of Molecular, Genetic and Population Health Sciences","Tom Clemens, School of GeoSciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"P&M Transition - Award Setup","MRC Centre for Reproductive Health"

2018,2019-04-12,"Successful","8119467","the impact of primary and secondary epithelial senescence on renal function and fibrosis","Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects over 850 million people worldwide. It is a disease process which occurs in the kidneys after injury and causes the kidneys to become scarred; a term we call 'fibrosis'.  Injuries can range from simple things; like short periods of infection and low blood pressure to more complicated and rarer diseases which affect the kidney tissue itself. Regardless of the initial injury and regardless of this initial injury going away completely, we believe that the kidney is permanently damaged. Often we don't measure this in blood or urine tests; these become normal again. But we know from observational data that having even one such episode, even if brief and completely resolved, puts a person at significantly higher risk of developing CKD.  CKD is often progressive; meaning that it gets worse over time. At present, we don't have any treatments to stop or slow this progression and this can ultimately lead to complete kidney failure and the requirement for regular dialysis or kidney transplantation.  We also know that in individuals with CKD, although the scarring is in the kidneys, their chance of heart disease, and death from heart disease is significantly increased.

There are certain processes and cellular changes which occur in response to these injuries (not just in a kidney, but in other organs too) which we believe contribute to this progressive scarring.  If they can be targeted and blocked it could prevent this inevitable scar formation. 

This PhD will focus on one such pathway, and a group of cells; called 'senescent cells'. These are cells which are damaged but do not die in a normal programmed way. Furthermore, we know that these cells communicate with other cells in the body to promote scarring. We find senescent cells in human kidneys in lots of different kidney diseases, we find them in older kidneys and we find them around the time of kidney injury. So far; we know that we can treat and remove these cells safely in a mouse then that mouse lives a longer and healthier life. If we can study these cells and their signalling pathways in greater detail we believe this would be a potentially very successful treatment and would impact significantly on human kidney disease.","CMVM","Deanery of Clinical Sciences","UK - Research Council","medical research council","UNITED KINGDOM","clinical research training fellowship postdoc only not pre !!!","David Ferenbach","CTR FOR INFLAMMATION RESEARCH","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=8119467","RA4946",281486.14,"267845.77","0.00","13640.37","281486.14","MR/T008253/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","MRC Clinical Training Fellowship (Pre-doctoral)","CIR CSCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-02-05,2023-02-04,"Gillian Mutanga",NA,"Stuart Forbes, Deanery of Clinical Sciences","Jeremy Hughes, Deanery of Clinical Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Application Indicative Submitted","MRC Centre for Inflammation Research"

2018,2019-03-22,"Unsuccessful","8015402","ecoclim: ecological responses to climate warming across biomes - ecological stability as community thermophilization linked to species thermal traits","Climate change is impacting biodiversity across the planet in the largest and fastest environmental shift in recent geological history. In this proposal, we aim to determine how species traits (primarily thermal traits) promote community stability in the face of this unprecedented change. Understanding the consequences of these changes, including effects on biotic interactions, demands an understanding of mechanisms at species level. We propose to use a combination of data synthesis and field case studies to analyse warming-related long-term changes in community structure. Such changes, due to range shifts and the decline in cold-affinity species and increase in warm-affinity ones, are here termed 'thermophilization'.

We aim to compare rates of thermophilization in ecological communities across multiple biomes at large scales addressing four hypotheses. 1. Communities comprised of species with wide temperature ranges will change less than those composed of narrow-ranged ones; 2. Communities made up of species with contrasting thermal affinities will change faster than those with similar ones; 3. Communities whose species have affinities to environments cooler than the location considered will be more susceptible to warming. 4. Species traits, including body size, dispersal and longevity, will influence thermophilization rates beyond expectations 1-3. Our consortium consists of marine and terrestrial ecologists aiming for general rules applicable across biomes and those specific to example ecosystems: North Atlantic fish, plankton and coastal biota, Arctic tundra, Great Barrier Reef coral reefs and communities studied by project partners. Species thermal ranges from distribution models using global data in biodiversity databases (such as OBIS and GBIF) will be used to calculate weighted-mean thermal affinities (Community Temperature Index, CTI) for measuring thermophilization rates. Expectations for hypotheses 1-4 will be developed using community simulation models based on species thermal performance curves for abundance. Effects on ecosystems will be assessed by scaling up from species traits to novel estimates of functioning, from productivity in plant communities through trophic structure on coral reefs and biogeochemical fluxes in North Sea benthos.

PI Mike Burrows (SAMS) will extract thermal traits using species distribution models combining climate measures and habitat information. Co-Is Maria Dornelas and Anne Magurran (St Andrews) will use the BIOTIME database of community time series to examine global patterns of biodiversity change, and will lead the field case study of community re-assembly following the recent mass thermal disturbance among reef corals. Co-I Isla Myers-Smith (Edinburgh) will address how the principles apply to Arctic tundra communities, and Co-I Martin Edwards (MBA) will do the same for North Atlantic plankton.
Subcontractors John Pinnegar, Bryony Townhill and Clement Garcia (Cefas) will examine change in European shellfish and invertebrate communities to incorporate findings into different management scenarios. Finally, our network of international project partners will test our primary hypotheses and models in a range of contrasting ecosystems.
The proposal will deliver operational metrics of the response of ecological communities to climate change across multiple ecosystems, evidence for the strength of response to changing climate so far, and a solid theoretical and analytical framework for projecting expected shifts in community composition and structure under future climate change. We will extend these responses to ecosystem scales by scaling up through species functional traits and altered interactions to novel estimates of functioning.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","UK - Research Council","natural environment research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard grant","Isla Myers-Smith","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=8015402",NA,448557.09,"301656.09","146901.00",NA,"358845.67",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"GEO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-01-01,2022-12-31,"David Dougal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA
2018,2019-03-20,"Unsuccessful","7777763","improving the wellbeing of mothers through early recognition and treatment of bleeding after childbirth: obstetric bleeding study 3 (obs3) a cluster randomised trial","WHAT IS THE HEALTH CARE NEED? Unusually heavy bleeding after childbirth affects about 40000 women a year in the UK and is called postpartum haemorrhage. For 5000 of these women the bleeding can be very serious leading to about 320 women having a hysterectomy and 700 admissions to intensive care each year. As a result about 18000 women suffer symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder every year.
SUPPORTING RESEARCH Heavy bleeding after childbirth is caused by obstetric complications but may be worsened by blood clotting problems. We have shown that a clotting factor called fibrinogen is crucial for controlling bleeding after childbirth. Women who start bleeding and have a low level of fibrinogen are more likely to go on to very severe bleeding. A major problem when treating bleeding after childbirth is that results of standard blood clotting tests take more than an hour to become available. To address this we looked at whether bedside clotting tests, which give results in 10 mins, could be used to guide treatment with fibrinogen and prevent unnecessary transfusion of blood products. During our research the number of very severe bleeds at our hospital fell from a UK average of 6 per 1000 births to 2 per 1000 births. To share learning, we started an All Wales Quality Improvement project called OBS Cymru. This is a package of care that includes accurately measuring the amount of bleeding and early bedside clotting tests. The package of care is designed to recognise abnormal bleeding early and to prevent small bleeds becoming very severe bleeds through early treatment of both the underlying cause of bleeding and any blood clotting problems. As a result, blood transfusion and severe bleeding after child birth has fallen by 25% across Wales. Although results of OBS Cymru are very encouraging, our confidence in them is limited by the lack of a comparison group or cost analysis. At present bedside clotting tests are only recommended in research settings and they will only be recommended in national guidelines if good clinical trial evidence shows their benefit. Rigorous testing is needed to see whether bedside clotting testing, within a holistic care pathway, reduces severe bleeding and is value for money. 
PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT Local patient groups have told us that avoiding a blood transfusion is important to them. They have also said that post-traumatic stress disorder caused by severe bleeding is a major issue and so looking into this will be an important part of the study. 
STUDY DESIGN We will allocate maternity units to either the OBS Cymru package of care or standard NHS care. The units will be allocated randomly to make sure the two groups are similar and can be compared. The package of care includes: 
-	Accurate measurement of blood loss to ensure early recognition of bleeding so senior clinicians can treat the cause of the bleeding
-	Standardised paperwork to help make sure that treatment follows guidelines
-	Early diagnosis and treatment of abnormal clotting guided by bedside tests
-	Units will be audited every 3 months so they know how well they are doing and to help make the package of care part of routine practice 
MAIN OUTCOME We will measure the number of women with severe bleeding defined by one or more of the following: death, hysterectomy, blood transfusion or admission to intensive care. We will also study psychological impact and cost effectiveness.

2018,2019-03-07,"Successful","4129795","reconciling volcanic forcing and climate records throughout the last millennium (vol-clim)","Volcanic eruptions are an important driver of climate variability and climate change, yet climate model simulations do not agree with data on the magnitude of temperature changes caused by large-magnitude volcanic eruptions. The Vol-Clim project will resolve this discrepancy by deriving new and improved estimates of volcanic forcing using a state-of-the-art Earth System Model developed in the UK (UKESM1), which will allow us to quantify and better understand how large explosive volcanic eruptions affected the climate system since 1250 CE. The model explicitly accounts for the interaction of chemical, dynamical and aerosol microphysical processes during volcanic eruptions, all of which affect the magnitude of the climate response. However, these processes have not been taken into account in previous assessments of climate change and natural climate variability caused by volcanic eruptions since 1250 CE.

In detail, at least 60 volcanic eruptions have been detected based on volcanic deposits in polar ice-cores since 1250 CE.
Large-magnitude eruptions emit sulphur dioxide high into the stratosphere where it is oxidized to form sulphuric acid
vapour, which nucleates and condenses to form sulphate aerosol particles. These aerosol particles scatter and absorb energy from the Sun thereby cooling the Earth's surface. In terms of the magnitude of this surface cooling, tree-rings (and other data) appear to show a smaller hemispheric temperature response (of up to 1 degree Celsius) to volcanic eruptions than simulated by current climate models. This mismatch means that at present we do not fully understand how the climate system including clouds responds after volcanic eruptions. We also do not fully understand how tree growth and subsequently tree-rings respond as a consequence of the cooling induced by a volcanic eruption. Overall, these uncertainties affect our ability to use climate models to simulate past, present and future changes of climate.

Current climate models have simple implementations of volcanic effects, ignoring many key chemical and physical
processes relevant after volcanic eruptions. Using UKESM1 we will be able to simulate the evolution of volcanic aerosol
particles with unprecedented sophistication, which has the potential to greatly improve the fidelity of predicted climatic
effects and reconcile model-simulated and observational records of climate change after volcanic eruptions. Our
simulations in UKESM1 will cover the period 1250 CE to present, which will enable us to characterize and evaluate annual to centennial-scale effects on global and hemispheric surface temperatures, climate variability and impacts on surface ocean temperatures for eruptions of different frequencies and intensities. 

Vol-Clim is an ambitious project that aligns closely with international initiatives and NERC's main goals. Quantifying the contribution of volcanic eruptions to climate variability over the past millennium is key to understanding present day and future decadal-scale climate variability; this is in line with NERC's main goal 'to understand and predict how the planet works'. Vol-Clim will also help prepare society for the effects of future eruptions. Vol-Clim is also strongly aligned to international activities such as the new Past Global Changes (PAGES) working group ""Volcanic Impacts on Climate and Society (VICS)"" and the PMIP (Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project) and CMIP (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) communities. We will generate a volcanic aerosol forcing time-series (1250 CE to present) for use in those models that do not account for the chemical and physical aerosol processes in the stratosphere. These deliverables are relevant for CMIP6-endorsed activities such as VolMIP (Model Inter-comparison Project on the Climatic Response to Volcanic Forcing) and RFMIP (Radiative Forcing Model Inter-comparison Project), and also the IPCC.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","UK - Research Council","natural environment research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard grant","Gabi Hegerl","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4129795","RA4633",235772,"153679.00","82093.00",NA,"188617.60","RG94689","NO","University of Cambridge",NA,"GEO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-03-01,2022-11-30,"David Dougal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Leeds,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of St Andrews,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Cambridge,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"Award Indicative Successful",NA

anthropogenic decisions that affect and are affected by disease transmission and associated risks. These
coupled systems generally involve multiple hosts distributed over geographically and socioeconomically
heterogeneous landscapes. These complexities create many challenges for resource managers tasked with
constructing coherent, cost-effective and workable disease control strategies. Our proposed research is
designed to address these challenges by investigating the overarching research question ""How do the
spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission interact with human risk responses to
influence risk-management decisions for complex disease networks that bridge natural and managed
landscapes?"".Specifically, our cross-disciplinary team will investigate: (i) how animal and land use
management decisions over geographically and socioeconomically heterogeneous landscapes create or
mitigate disease risks to wildlife and livestock, and how these effects and associated risk-management
opportunities differ across landscapes and from those in aspatial settings; (ii) the natural cross-system
""communities"" that influence decision-making and control; (iii) the important socioeconomic-ecological
tradeoffs for managing disease risks in complex spatial networks with different characteristics, and how
targeted management strategies might be developed to reflect these tradeoffs. Conceptually, we will
develop a spatial, ""multiscale socioeconomic-ecological multi-layer network"" framework to understand
the epidemiological, population, and behavioral dynamic interactive feedbacks among the economic and
ecological subsystems. Using bioeconomic modeling and adaptive management approaches, we will
examine cost-effective management in this complex setting. Further insights will be gained via two case
studies: (a) bovine tuberculosis in Michigan deer and cattle; (b) brucellosis in Greater Yellowstone Area

2018,2018-11-14,"Pending","3752608","reconstructing residence patterns in neolithic scotland","The transition to farming Europe is frequently thought of as being accompanied by a decline in residential mobility, with farmers becoming sedentary to enable the cultivation of crops. In turn, a settled farming life is often assumed to have formed the basis for agricultural intensification and for the development of increasingly complex societies. Recently, however, the application of new scientific techniques has started to challenge this viewpoint. Strontium and sulphur isotope analysis help us to evaluate where an individual obtained their childhood diet. Use of these techniques has begun to provide evidence for cultural diversity in settlement patterns during the Neolithic in different regions of Europe. Scotland has, however, remained under-represented in the application of such techniques. By undertaking analysis on assemblages dating from the start of agriculture to the later Neolithic in this region, from the 4th to the 3rd millennium BC, this project will provide direct evidence for the nature of land use and mobility patterns during the Neolithic in Scotland.","CAHSS","School of History, Classics and Archaeology","UK - Research Council","british academy","UNITED KINGDOM","postdoctoral fellowships","Catriona Pickard","ARCHAEOLOGY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3752608",NA,293363.48,"171837.75","121525.73",NA,"235890.78",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"HCA",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-09-01,2020-08-31,"Craig Landt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

2018,2018-11-01,"Unsuccessful","7091240","retrospective cohort study of prescription of medication for mental health conditions in epilepsy and seizure frequency, health care resource utilisation and mortality: innovative and cost-efficient use of routinely collected data with health economics assessment","Epilepsy, one of the most common neurological conditions, affects 50 million people of all ages worldwide. People with epilepsy (PWE) often have comorbid mental health conditions including psychoses (in 6%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (in 20-50%) and depression (in 35%). Yet PWE with these mental health conditions often receive no medication for them because of concerns they may worsen seizure control, increase health care utilization (General Practice consultations, referral to hospital epilepsy specialists, hospital attendances) (HCRU), and cause premature death. There is insufficient information available to clarify whether concerns are justified. Good quality studies on the subject are urgently needed. This study will be the first to provide accurate estimates of changes in seizure frequency, HCRU or death risk in PWE after being prescribed medication for psychoses, ADHD and or depression. Study results will help patients and clinicians make better-informed decisions on pros and cons of using medications for psychoses, ADHD and or depression in PWE. All patients and members of the public we consulted thought our proposal important. We will take an innovative cost-efficient approach of using and analysing existing ""Big Data"" from general practices and national data sources, rather than carrying out a randomised controlled trial. Whilst often considered the ""gold standard"" in medical research, trials often exclude patients because they have several co-occurring medical conditions. ""Big Data"" on the other hand are obtained on almost everyone in natural, routine clinical practice. Compared to trials, ""Big Data"" can provide findings more relevant to everyday clinical practice, potentially offer much larger patient numbers, and include a wider patient group with a number of different conditions. We have an experienced team and will build on earlier work that shows proof of concept that we can do this study. We will obtain and use anonymised data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), linked with hospital attendance information from the national Hospital Episode Statistics and death records from the Office of National Statistics. CPRD is one of the world's largest holders of computerised electronic health records from general practitioners. It provides regular quality checks on each surgery to ensure their practice data are up-to-standard for research. It provides a representative sample of the UK population so study results will be generalisable to the entire UK. The latest set of linked CPRD data includes more than 10 million patients from more than 400 practices. A statutory trusted third party will carry out data linkage, and only anonymised data to protect patient confidentiality will be transferred safely and securely to the research team. We will assess the seizure frequency, HCRU and risk of death in a) ALL PWE and b) PWE with mental ill health prior to prescription of medication for psychoses,ADHD and or depression and compare with after they have received prescriptions. To check whether observations are specific to PWE, we will repeat analyses in patients without epilepsy and assess their HCRU and death risk before and after prescriptions. We will consider potential factors that may affect or provide alternative explanations for findings. HCRU cost before and after prescriptions will be determined. Results will be applicable for patient care within 24 months of study completion","CMVM","Deanery of Clinical Sciences","UK - Government","national institute for health research","UNITED KINGDOM","health technology assesment (hta) (tr)","Richard Chin","CTR FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7091240",NA,667608.75,"501546.74","166062.00",NA,"536865.00","NIHR128090","YES","University of Edinburgh",NA,"CRH",NA,NA,NA,"Translational (TR)","NoFlag","Yes",NA,2019-09-01,2022-02-28,"Mathieu Donner",NA,"Andrew Stoddart, Deanery of Molecular, Genetic and Population Health Sciences","Christopher Weir, Deanery of Molecular, Genetic and Population Health Sciences","Aziz Sheikh, Deanery of Molecular, Genetic and Population Health Sciences","Andrew Stanfield, Deanery of Clinical Sciences","Andrew McIntosh, Deanery of Clinical Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","MRC Centre for Reproductive Health"

2018,2018-09-29,"Successful","7092104","international: integrating globally-recognised sustainability metrics for tropical perennial crops in a one-stop shop cool farm tool","We will develop a fully integrated environmental decision support tool for tropical perennial crops and deliver a full technical specification for inclusion into the online, and freely available Cool Farm Tool. The Cool Farm Tool is owned by the Cool Farm Alliance (CFA) who will partner on this project. It is a business-led initiative to assess and improve the sustainability of agriculture-based supply chains. It is funded via a membership model, with membership consisting of over 50 companies including for example major multinationals such as Unilever, PepsiCo, Heineken, Danone, Nestle, Marks and Spencer, and Tesco. Members pay to maintain the tool and deploy at scale in their supply chains but it is a core principle of the Alliance that the tool is and will always be free-to-use for farmers.
The CFT itself is a science-based decision support tool designed for use by farmers at farm scale. It has benefitted from significant NERC Discovery and Innovation funding in the past and as a result includes a growing suite of metrics for crop and livestock systems in an expanding set of geographic locations (over 100 countries). Several case studies have shown the impact that has been derived using the tool, for example PepsiCo's ""50-in-5"" (http://pepsico.co.uk/live/story/celebrating-sustainable-farming) and egg production in North America resulting in a 25% reduction in the carbon footprint from primary production (Vetter et al 2018).
Tropical perennial crops are of huge importance to global food supply chains and typically have high dependence on smallholder farmers in DAC countries where decision-support has been hindered less scientific evidence and the focus of researchers in temperate regions. This project build on numerous previous NERC and Wellcome Trust outputs and exploits established successful relationships between the project partners to ensure delivery. We will develop modules based around the existing CFT methods to allow a one-stop shop assessment tool for carbon and water footprinting and biodiversity impacts of farm practice in tropical perennials. Through partnership with the Cool Farm Alliance and the £5.4M Wellcome Trust funded SHEFS project we will ensure delivery of a tool which has practical value to farmers and supply chains. This business-led, science-based, and farmer-focused project will thereby provide robust metrics which will allow farmers to engage and demonstrate their positive actions for sustainability into international supply chains, and the businesses to identify good practices to embed in their sustainable sourcing strategies. The possibility to combine, in a single decision support tool, the multiple impacts of farm practices is attractive for many reasons, not least being that it will reduce the current burden on farmers to conduct multiple assessments of dubious value on multiple impacts for multiple buyers.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Research Council","natural environment research council","UNITED KINGDOM","innovation","Jonathan Hillier","GLOBAL ACADEMY AGRICULTURE &FS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7092104","RA4895",154995,"105280.00","49715.00",NA,"123996.00","NE/S013962/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Innovation Projects 2018","Roslin","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2019-10-24,2022-03-31,"Gillian Mutanga",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Cambridge,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,Collaborator,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund,Roslin ISPG 17/22 - N/A,DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)","The Roslin Institute"

This visionary project addresses the key needs of patients, clinicians and the World Health Organisations stated
deliverables of affordable, reliable and point-of-care molecular TB diagnostics, with the vision of removing the need for
centralised facilities and offering remote primary care diagnosis coupled with telemetry for “cloud based” notification to
ensure public health and surveillance interventions. The core technology deliverables will include: Rapid screening of TB
infection (within 30 mins): We will develop low-cost portable optical devices and chemical molecular probes for accurate and
rapid ‘triage tests’ to allow ‘no-wash’ detection of Mycobacteria ‘in-field’ in sputum at costs comparable with or lower than
existing microscopy-based methods. This technology has the aim of replacing current sputum-based microscopy methods.
Rapid molecular identification of drug resistance (within 2 hours): We will develop novel low-cost assays based on molecular
methods that will allow accurate and rapid screening for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in sputum and drugresistant
tuberculosis, thus providing rapid screening of at risk groups for TB as well as identification of drug resistance
profiles. Biomarkers for early diagnosis and assessing treatment response: A higher risk element is the development of
point-of-care diagnostics for quantification of microRNAs (that are known to be modulated during progression from latent to
active TB and during treatment progression), directly from small blood samples. We will ensure that the technologies are
economically viable in the context of resource poor settings – indeed the whole project will be driven by practical need and
local resourcing constraints – NOT imposition. Thus it will requiring negligible initial costs for implementation, minimal
training and expertise, with the running costs less than 1/10 th of current detection technologies, thereby addressing a key
objective of the work program.","CSE","School of Chemistry","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - health, demographic change and wellbeing","Mark Bradley","CHEMISTRY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6660901","RE8295, RE8298 & RE8476",789460.85,"631568.68","157892.17",NA,"789460.85","825931","YES","University of Edinburgh","H2020-SC1-BHC-2018-2020 H2020-SC1-BHC-21-2018","CHE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-01-01,2021-06-30,"David Dougal",NA,"Garry Blakely, School of Biological Sciences","Kevin Dhaliwal, Deanery of Clinical Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Heriot-Watt University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Universita Degli Studi di Padova,Collaborator,HEI,ITALY|Indian Council for Medical Research,Collaborator,Government,INDIA|DestiNA Genomics Ltd,Collaborator,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM|OPTOI Srl,Collaborator,Industry,ITALY|GENETIC ANALYSIS STRATEGIES SL - GAS,Collaborator,Industry,SPAIN|Central TB Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences,Collaborator,Industry,RUSSIAN FEDERATION|ShanMukha Innovations,Collaborator,Industry,INDIA",NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - Bayes Centre","MRC Centre for Inflammation Research"

But how can we ensure that our assessment of vulnerability is both accurate and just?
In this project we propose to examine socioeconomic indicators, such as gender, age, race, and income to evaluate the overall vulnerability of a given community or geographical area. Equipped with the results of this assessment, we will build quantitative models to help policymakers and disaster managers to justify the selective targeting of specific communities over others. In doing so we hope to develop a tool with which to improve several logistics activities in complex humanitarian crises characterised by socioeconomically inequitable environments towards a more objective decision-making, avoiding decisions solely based on political biases.","CAHSS","Business School","UK - Research Council","british academy","UNITED KINGDOM","ba/leverhulme small research grants","Douglas Alem","BUSINESS SCHOOL","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6723788","R45697",8274.75,"8274.75","0.00",NA,"8274.75","SRG18R1\180939","NO","University of Edinburgh","BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants 2018","BUSINESS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-09-01,2020-02-28,"Anna Votsi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI)",NA

economy, cultural tourism, and intellectual property. It contributes to policy and practice in terms of urban regeneration, education, and soft power diplomacy, as well as quality of life and life satisfaction. It is feted as being a driver for social mobility, and for the progressiveness and belief in meritocracy of the workforce. However, research has also revealed the significant exclusions from this picture: the creative workforce demonstrates substantial inequalities in terms of social class origin, gender and ethnicity. Moreover, existing research has demonstrated the low chances people from working class origins have of entering the creative economy workforce did not change significantly between 1981 and 2011, despite huge changes in the social structure of English society. Cultural  consumption too is strongly stratified according to social class and ethnic group. The lack of representativeness amongst those that that create and commission of culture is the subject of sustained debate in public, policy and industry circles. There are also important inequalities in the geographical distribution of cultural investments.
This research builds on recent AHRC-funded projects to explore each of these dimensions of exclusions from the creative economy in turn, in three linked work packages.","CAHSS","Edinburgh College of Art","UK - Research Council","arts and humanities research council","UNITED KINGDOM","leadership fellows","Orian Brook","HISTORY OF ART","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6723604","RA4590",225844.31,"138044.75","87799.56",NA,"180675.45","AH/S004394/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","RCUK Innovation Fellowship - Creative and Digital Economy 31 May 2018","ECA",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-01-01,2021-06-30,"Emma Giles",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

Because of this gap, we do not know if region has a single ecosystem encompassing all of its high-growth entrepreneurial community or if it has multiple, nested ecosystems based around particular sectors. This distinction is particularly important when studying the FinTech sector, which requires cutting-edge technological know-how combined with deep insights into the finance industry to capitalize on new opportunities. This leads to the basic research question: do regions have a single entrepreneurial ecosystem or are they divided into multiple, nested ecosystems? This unanswered question makes it difficult to craft effective public policies to support FinTech high-growth entrepreneurship. To address this issue, this project will conduct a mixedmethods study on the overlap between finance and technology communities in British ecosystems. A quantitative study will examine the backgrounds of the founding and advising teams of FinTech startups and scale-ups in four British ecosystems: the City of London, East London (Silicon Roundabout), Edinburgh, and Leeds. This analysis will be followed up with a qualitative study of knowledge flow between finance and technology communities in Edinburgh, Scotland. This approach will provide rigorous and robust evidence for the relationship between regional entrepreneurial and sectoral ecosystems. This will in turn help researchers to develop better approaches to studying ecosystems as well as help us understand the role of cross-sectorial knowledge sharing in supporting high-growth
entrepreneurship.","CAHSS","Business School","Overseas - Other","kenan institute of private enterprise","UNITED STATES","research grant","Ben Spigel","BUSINESS SCHOOL","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6606038","R83903",7163.14,"7163.14","0.00",NA,"7163.14","{00108904.00CX 3}_ct-6300","NO","University of Edinburgh","Small Grants (Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research Proposal)","BUSINESS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-06-01,2021-12-31,"Emma Giles",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI)",NA

Therapy, though useful, is best by problems of resistance, affordability and toxic side effects, while vaccine and cure remain distant prospects. 

Identifying new ways to block the virus are needed. Our lab has defined a block that occurs when HIV tries to infect certain immune cells caused by a cellular protein REAF/RPRD2. We now wish to define the mechanism that underpins this block to know if it may be feasibly exploited.

For HIV to infect a cell it must convert its own RNA genome into DNA and place into the host's genome, and then it can make more copies of itself. This unique process is only carried out by viruses such as HIV, and so we propose that REAF/RPRD2 is specialised to detect this process to block the infection and signal to the cell that a virus is present. 

In our study we will identify the virus RNA and DNA structures that are sensed and blocked by cellular REAF/RPRD2 using microscopy based approaches. Next we will map the signalling pathways that REAF/RPRD2 triggers if HIV, or RNA and DNA that resembles virus, is present. By defining what REAF/RPRD2 senses to block virus and send warnin messages to the cell, we will in future be able to devise new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving and enhancing this immune response leading to a HIV control infected individuals.","CMVM","Deanery of Biomedical Sciences","UK - Charity","tenovus scotland","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Richard Sloan","DIV INFECTION & PATHWAY MEDIC","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6688018",NA,20000,"20000.00","0.00",NA,"20000.00",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","Pilot projects","IM",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-08-01,2020-01-31,"Natasha Curley",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Infection Medicine"

Our overarching objective is to co-develop, with our policy partners, new systems science economic evaluation methods
that are used to inform the design, implementation and iterative, intelligence-led refinement of non-health sector policies
that prevent non-communicable disease and health inequalities.
ESSENTIAL OBJECTIVES - necessary for SIPHER to produce the intended policy and methodological innovations
WS1 Co-produce system maps of the four policy areas with policy partners
WS1 Identify core policy questions and evidence needs in each focus area
WS1 Elicit policy partner narratives to understand changes in policy contexts, including aims, targets, delivery mechanisms,
evidence use, beliefs and assumptions, synergies and tensions, as well as shifts in cause-and-consequence thinking
WS1 Identify and track evidence user and policy responses to SIPHER activities and outputs
WS2 Develop an evidence review methods framework to support complex systems modelling
WS2 Undertake evidence reviews of policy benefits, costs and health inequality impacts in SIPHER's policy areas to
provide inputs for models
WS3 Undertake a data audit for each focus area and identify data required for the project
WS3 Use existing Leeds infrastructure to securely house and curate data
WS3 Combine partner data with public datasets to create synthetic populations
WS4 Develop whole-systems policy macromodelling
WS4 Undertake population-level modelling to perform policy appraisal across target health and non-health outcomes
WS5 Develop a dynamic microsimulation tool populated with synthetic population data
WS5 Undertake micro-level modelling to perform policy appraisals
WS6 Elicit public and policy maker preferences for income, health and non-health outcomes and improving averages vs reducing inequalities in policy outcomes
WS7 Build a whole-systems policy appraisal tool for governments, including a comprehensive set of economic costs and
benefits to support cross-sectoral decision-making
WS7 Enable policymakers and their analytical teams to interactively explore the conflicts, synergies and interactions
between the estimated impacts of different policy options
WS7 Identify best-buy policies that maximise benefits across health and other sectors' priorities
WS8 Evaluate partner organisations' ""healthy public policy"" efforts in the focus policy areas, and SIPHER's contributions to

THE PROBLEM
There is strong evidence that the social and economic conditions in which we grow, live, work and age determine our
health to a much larger degree than lifestyle choices. These social determinants of health, such as income, good quality
homes, education or work, are not distributed equally in society, which leads to health inequalities. However, we know very
little about how specific policies influence the social conditions to prevent ill health and reduce health inequalities. Also,
most social determinants of health are the responsibility of policy sectors other than ""health"", which means policymakers
need to promote health in ALL their policies if they are to have a big impact on health. SIPHER will provide new scientific
evidence and methods to support such a shift from ""health policy"" to ""healthy public policy"".
OUR POLICY FOCUS
We will work with three policy partners at local, regional and national level to tackle their above-average chronic disease
burden and persistent health inequalities: Sheffield City Council, Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Scottish
Government. We will focus on four jointly agreed policy priorities for good health:
- Creating a fairer economy
- Promoting mental wellbeing
- Providing affordable, good quality housing
- Preventing long-term effects of difficult childhoods.
OUR COMPLEX SYSTEMS SCIENCE APPROACH
Each of the above policy areas is a complex political system with many competing priorities, where policy choices in one
sector (e.g. housing) can have large unintended effects in others (e.g. poverty). There is often no ""correct"" solution
because compromises between different outcomes require value judgements. This means that to assess the true benefits
and costs of a policy in relation to health, policy effects and their interdependencies need to be assessed across a wide
range of possible outcomes. However, no policymaker has knowledge of the whole system and future economic and
political developments are uncertain. Ongoing monitoring of expected and unexpected effects of policies and other system
changes is crucial so failing policies can be revised or dropped.
We propose to use complex systems modelling, which has been developed to understand and make projections of what
might happen in complex systems given different plausible assumptions about future developments. Our models will be
underpinned by the best available data and prior research in each policy area. Our new evidence about likely policy effects
across a wide range of outcomes will help policy partners decide between alternative policies, depending on how important
different outcomes are to them (e.g. improving health or economic growth). We will develop support tools that can visualise
the forecasts, identify policies that achieve the desired balance between competing outcomes and update
recommendations when new information emerges. Whilst new to public health policy, these methods are well-established
in engineering and climate science.
We will
1. Work with policy partners to understand the policy systems and evidence needs
2. Bring together existing data and evidence on each policy system (e.g. links between policies and outcomes,
interdependencies between outcomes)
3. Explore citizens' preferences for prioritising when not all outcomes can be achieved
4. Link policies and their health and non-health effects in computer models to analyse benefits and costs over time
5. Build an interactive tool to help policy decision-making, inform advocacy action and support political debate.
SIPHER's MAIN OUTCOME
We will provide policymakers with a new methodology that allows them to estimate the health-related costs and benefits of
policies that are implemented outside the health sector. This will be useful to our partners, and others, who want to assess
how scarce public sector resources can be spent to maximise the health and wellbeing benefits from all their activities.

BACKGROUND: Systems science reframes public policies as active components of a complex, dynamic, policy system
that includes mechanisms such as feedback between interrelated effects, effect delay and system adaptation. In public
health, systems science has challenged and helped to change infectious disease policy, including vaccination strategies for
poliomyelitis and measles. However, it has not yet realised its potential impact on non-communicable disease (NCD) policy,
in part due to a lack of compatible methods to appraise policy effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.
VISION: SIPHER will be a world-leading centre of excellence for innovative, public health and health economics focused
systems science. During UKPRP, it will catalyse a shift from health policies to whole-systems, healthy public policy.
THEORY OF CHANGE: SIPHER's policy partners seek to reduce NCDs and health inequalities (HI) by incorporating health
considerations into non-health sectors. Academic and policy partners will co-produce complex systems decision modelling
and evaluate its effectiveness in supporting policy design in four focus areas: inclusive economic growth; housing; adverse
childhood experiences; and mental health.
RESEARCH: Eight interwoven workstrands will investigate: how policymakers think about and use evidence; iterative
evidence synthesis; working securely with sensitive data and building simulated populations; individual- and populationlevel dynamic models; values and preferences for equitable outcomes; identification of win-wins, best-buys, and adaptable
policies across sectors; process evaluation.
USER ENGAGEMENT: Co-production across local, regional and national government and knowledge transfer support by
influential partners.
BENEFITS: SIPHER will deliver scalable and transferable methods and tools to design, target, advocate for, implement
and monitor policy strategies that maximise NCD prevention and health inequality reductions.","CMVM","Deanery of Molecular, Genetic and Population Health Sciences","UK - Research Council","medical research council","UNITED KINGDOM","joint partners","Ellen Stewart","SOCIAL & POLITICAL STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6338060","RA4818",49509,"38887.00","10622.00",NA,"33171.00","MR/S037578/1 ( R/155583 - internal Sheffield ref)","NO","University of Sheffield","UK Prevention Research Partnership (UKPRP) – Consortium and Network Awards","CPHS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-09-16,2024-09-15,"Katherine Quinn",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Strathclyde,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Manchester,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Newcastle,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Leeds,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Sheffield,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","zDDI-Health_Social_Care,DDI Hub - Usher","Centre for Population Health Sciences"
2017,2018-04-04,"Successful","6383402","digital livelihoods? the online gig economy and the future of decent refugee work in cities","This project aims to explore the contribution of digitally mediated labour to the provision of decent work and livelihoods among displaced persons in cities, with a focus on Berlin and Beirut. Both these cities are leading hubs for digital innovation and have recently absorbed large numbers of refugees, prompting a growth in digital work initiatives. These emerged against the backdrop of a growing online 'gig economy' around the world amid an increasingly urban and 'connected' displaced population: more than 60 percent of the world's refugees now live in cities. These combined factors of urbanised refugee economies and the digitalisation of work demand urgent research into the relationship between the online gig economy and displaced populations. Yet despite a growing body of research on digital economies in development contexts, it is poorly understood how the online gig economy reshapes the world of work among displaced persons. Aiming to fill this knowledge gap in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO), the
Oxford Internet Institute (OII), and hosted by the University of Edinburgh, this project pursues three research objectives:
a) Generate empirical evidence about the digitally mediated work lives of refugees through fieldwork in Berlin and Beirut;
b) Gain insights through research of selected digital platforms that offer digital work opportunities and employment trainings;
c) Establish a new methodological framework that links ethnography with multidisciplinary methods in the social sciences of the digital, and develop new research skills through trainings.
In fulfilment of these research objectives, the project follows two overarching questions:
1) How does digitally mediated labour reshape refugees' access to decent work and sustainable livelihoods?
2) What implications do these transformations have for the rights and policies that govern urban refugee economies, and for the way displacement is conceptualised in the social sciences?
These overarching questions are complemented by three empirical sub-questions that correspond directly to the research objectives and three methodological dimensions:
a) What types of digitally mediated work do refugees do, how do they get access to it, and what impact does it have on their social and economic lives?
b) How do digital work platforms relate to the specific situation of displaced populations, and what impact do they pursue in comparison to the actual experiences of refugee workers?
c) What new combinations of qualitative ethnographic research and digital research methods allow us to grasp how digital economies and refugees' working practices intersect and overlap?
In line with the New Investigator Grant's aims, the project pursues additional objectives on two levels: skills development and impact.
Skills development objectives include completion of a leadership programme at the host institution; the development of new
approaches and methods during a three-months visit to the Oxford Internet Institute (OII); and the learning of effective user
engagement by collaborating with the ILO and providers of digital work opportunities in the third sector and the private sector.
The knowledge exchange and impact objectives include convening a workshop and an international conference with key users at the host institution; production of high-quality research outputs, including an ILO Working Paper, with impact on both users and academic beneficiaries; the creation of a project website and a Briefing for policy makers and platform developers titled 'A Just Gig Economy for Refugees'.
The newly gained skills, networks and knowledge throughout this project will facilitate the creation of sustainable research capacity at the host institution through follow-up funding applications with a clear long-term aim in mind: the formation of a research cluster on 'Digital Development' at Edinburgh's School of Social and Political Science.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","UK - Research Council","economic and social research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grants","Andreas Hackl","SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6383402","RA4689",299959.44,"196286.94","103672.50",NA,"239967.55","ES/S005757/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","New Investigators Award","SPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-05-01,2021-04-30,"Ina Lindsay",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"International Labour Organisation,Partner,Government,SWITZERLAND|Oxford Internet Institute,Partner,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI)","Unclassified"

2017,2018-02-16,"Unsuccessful","6432392","socioeconomic assessment for heat decisions","Decarbonising heat is, in the UK Government's words, ""our most difficult policy and technology challenge to meet our carbon targets,"" (2017 Clean Growth Strategy p. 75). This is not because of a lack of low carbon heat technologies, but because it is difficult to identify which technologies should be used in which buildings, when changes to buildings should be made, and how the costs of transition should be paid for. The Energy Research Partnership has called for a 'new decision making framework' for heat, and the Committee on Climate Change argues that critical decisions on heat need to be taken in the early 2020s. This research explores one technique likely to be central to any such decision making framework: socioeconomic assessment (SEA). 

SEAs weigh up the costs and benefits of different outcomes, but seek to do so from a neutral 'society-wide' perspective, accounting for more than just financial costs and benefits (e.g. incorporating pollution costs and health benefits) thereby expressing a conception of the 'common good'. This is important to decision making for heat decarbonisation as the transition faces three challenges, each of which implies increased government intervention: the aggregate financial costs of decarbonised heat in the UK are projected to be higher than the incumbent system, meaning non-financial benefits are critical to justifying interventions; some technologies (particularly district heating) depend on area-wide characteristics rather than individual buildings, and so require new public planning for heat; and recognition is growing that policy 'tweaks' to financial incentives are insufficient to drive change, creating pressure for more interventionist policies that restrict individual choice (such as regulating minimum energy standards for existing buildings, a policy already adopted for the private rented sector).

However, using SEA for heat decision making is not simply a matter of reading the 'common good' off a fixed set of calculations. SEAs can be conducted in different ways, and different approaches can lead to radically different outcomes. For example, the socially cost effective potential for district heating in the UK has been estimated in one official study to range from 3% to 40%, depending on how financing costs are treated. Different methods of SEA can lead to different decisions. For these decisions to be accepted as securing the 'common good', the methods used must be considered to be appropriate by different stakeholders. Have the right issues been taken into account? Is the process sufficiently transparent? Are the organisations responsible for defining and executing assessments trusted? Failing against these questions is likely to undermine the legitimacy and robustness of policies, leading to reluctance to implement or comply with them and hence negative consequences for progress in heat decarbonisation.

This study explores the use of SEA for heat in the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany to understand the conditions under which these assessments are effective in establishing the legitimacy and robustness of public authorities' decisions. Three separate sites are investigated:
1.	Guiding national heat policy. What are the main differences in the organisation and content of SEA used to inform heat policies? What are the consequences of these differences for decisions between technologies?
2.	Guiding local heat planning. How can SEA support local heat planning? Can SEA be an effective approach to resolving local controversies about heat strategies? How do local and national SEAs relate to each other?
3.	Guiding commercial decisions. How can public SEAs help guide businesses' investment decisions and develop innovative heat supply business models?

Previous research has identified domestic animal origins in time and space and theories on the domestication process. There
remain, however, significant gaps in understanding and evidence for how animal husbandry evolved and how this affected animal and human health, especially in relation to the origins of zoonoses. This research will address these issues through a study of the evolution of goat husbandry as it emerged in the natural habitat of the wild goat in the Zagros Mountains of Iran and Iraq, spread, and was adapted to new environments in the wider region (c.10,000-5,000 BC). A suite of interdisciplinary scientific methodologies will be applied to excavated archaeological remains to identify how goat ecology changed through the domestication process and how this impacted animal and human health. This project investigates the health consequences of ecosystem engineering, an acceleration of which occurred with the transition to farming, and contributes long-term
perspectives to current concerns as animal management evolves to ensure food security for the ever-growing
global human population.","CAHSS","School of History, Classics and Archaeology","UK - Charity","wellcome trust (rcl)","UNITED KINGDOM","collaborative awards in humanities and social science","Robin Bendrey","ARCHAEOLOGY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6184153",NA,856573.68,"856573.69","0.00",NA,"856573.68","212581/Z/18/Z","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"HCA",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-01-01,2022-06-30,"Nisha Patel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Oxford,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of the Highlands and Islands,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

(rosalind cavaghan)","The EU has long lauded gender equality as a core value of the EU, but this global leadership in equalities has suddenly disappeared. Critics argue that the EU has U-turned on gender equality since the financial crisis, prioritising narrowly defined economic aims, implemented through new policy mechanisms such as the European Semester. Negative impacts of these policies on women, particularly Black minority ethnic and migrant women are well-documented. Yet, EU strategic policy has not acknowledged or tackled these problems, despite unaltered legal frameworks promoting gender equality and Gender Mainstreaming, and activists’ attempts to highlight problems. Understandings the EU’s dramatically altered influence on equalities, thus requires innovative methodologies to directly study the implications of new implementation processes involved in new European economic governance. 
	This project operationalises Feminist Economists’ assertions, that concepts and measurements routinely used in economic policy formulation and assessment, normalise and instrumentalise gender and racial inequalities, monopolising the production of economic knowledge and marginalising alternative, intersectional perspectives. Using a novel methodology drawing on the Sociology of Knowledge this project traces policy processes involved in EU economic co-ordination and surveillance, in 4 Eurozone Member States to analyse: whether and how EU economic governance coordinates Member States to implement gender blind and gender biased economic policy; how feminist civil society has sought to influence these policies/been excluded and; variation between States.
	Findings open the ‘black box’ of EU economic policy implementation unpacking the new mechanisms through which the EU is now entrenching and normalising intersectional gender inequalities in Member States and marginalising dissenting voices, in turn revealing opportunities for activists to contest this decisive shift in the EU’s impact on equalities.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - european research council","Fiona Mackay","POLITICS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=5473664",NA,1152076.01,"921660.81","230415.20",NA,"1152076.01",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","ERC Starting Grant","SPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-01-01,2023-12-01,"Boleslaw Czarnecki",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Unclassified"

Myanmar serves as the project’s empirical entry point to explore why, how and under what circumstances the armed forces leave politics and countries embark on political transition. It also provides a prism to investigate the military’s control of key economic assets and the extent to which the armed forces relinquish not just political but also economic control. Next, the project seeks to draw some lessons from South Korea's democratization in the late 1980s in order to tease out the mechanisms that led to a successful outcome in Korea and identify the key challenges confronting Myanmar. This is especially important in light of Korea's rising economic clout in the country and the deepening political relationship between the two.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","british academy","UNITED KINGDOM","ba/leverhulme small research grants","Youngmi Kim","ASIAN STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=5912395","R45407",9999.97,"9999.99","0.00",NA,"9999.97","SRG\170547","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-06-01,2022-03-31,"Nisha Patel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA
2017,2017-10-26,"Successful","5708296","intra-household allocation of resources and economic development: the birth order effect paradox","Early-life conditions and investments are key for adult economic outcomes, with an increasing number of public policies targeting childhood years. In this context, parents play a decisive role on passing and allocating resources to children. The so-called ""birth order effect"" – differences among children of the same family by order of birth – provides evidence of the relevant role of parents, as older children have been shown to perform substantially better in terms of completed education, wages or employment. This is the case in a wide array of developed countries (UK, US or Norway, among others), but interestingly developing countries such as Ecuador or the Philippines show the opposite relationship, suggesting that economic development may affect how resources are allocated within the household.
This project aims to shed light on the role of economic  development on the birth order effect and, in general, distribution of available resources within the household. We will use a myriad of historical data sources from the U.S. and the Netherlands over the 19th and early 20th century to study how the birth order effect changes as societies become richer, and experience other changes associated with economic development, such as the decrease in the number of children per family or the decline of the agricultural sector. We will compare siblings over a long period of time to assess how differences among siblings changes as countries develop and families face different economic circumstances.","CAHSS","School of Economics","UK - Charity","carnegie trust for the universities of scotland","UNITED KINGDOM","research incentive grants","Ana Nuevo-Chiquero","ECONOMICS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=5708296","R45306",8813.92,"8813.92","0.00",NA,"8813.92","RIG007494","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"ECONOMICS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-06-04,2019-04-03,"Anna Votsi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

2017,2017-09-20,"Unsuccessful","4946906","all over again? a mixed-methods, spatial, and temporal study of the economic livelihoods of the burundian repeat refugees in north-western tanzania","Refugees are often primarily seen as beneficiaries of aid and protection, neglecting the fact that they are also economic actors. This research explores the livelihoods of refugees, looking at one group for whom maintaining economic networks is particularly vital: repeat refugees, those who are forcibly displaced multiple times because of protracted and repeated crises. The project focuses on the 'new' caseload of repeat Burundian refugees in Tanzania. Through a mixed-methods approach comparing different groups of refugees across time and space, the project aims to systematically further the academic debate on and understanding of the survival strategies of repeat refugees through time and space (e.g.
international aid, casual labour, retail shops, trans-border trade, etc.). More broadly, the project has the ambition to influence assistance to refugees and economic development strategies in host and home countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and beyond.
First, the project seeks to consolidate the development of a new, critical perspective in the study of refugees that looks at the livelihoods of repeat refugees and considers them as economic agents who develop self-reliance strategies, often engage in formal or informal work, and make use of aid programmes. It understands the concept of livelihood as rooted not only in the economy but also in time, space, and society. Through examining the evolution of refugee livelihoods through different episodes of forced migration using insights from economics and history, the research will lead to re-examining assumptions about refugees beyond the framework of protection.
In line with this, the second aim is to contribute to developing a methodological toolbox. The mixed-methods approach will integrate and combine instruments from development economics (survey and behavioural games), history (life histories), and participatory methods from arts and social sciences. Building on its skills and experience, the research team will work on adapting these methods, and their combination, to the study of refugee livelihoods and economies. This will be within the framework of an international collaboration with Burundian and Tanzanian researchers and the refugees themselves, thereby contributing to the building of research capacities in both the UK and the African Great Lakes Region.
Third, the project will generate new empirical data about the lives of repeat refugees and focus on issues seldom researched, such as the way refugees perceive their economic situation, mobilise, and act upon it through time and space.
Empirical data is crucial to drawing a rigorous and fine-grained analysis that will interest both (1) the growing community of researchers and practitioners working on refugee economies and their interactions with livelihoods and identities; and (2) the researchers and organisations who seek to understand the dynamics of the current crisis in Burundi and the Great Lakes region.
Fourth, the project seeks a deep practical relevance for refugee policy and programmes. The change of perspective mentioned above aims to produce evidence that encourages policy-makers to design more durable solutions for repeat refugees and host communities. Comparing groups of repeat refugees (inside and outside camps, with and without aid) will enrich the growing debate on refugee economies and contribute to broadening the horizons of approaches such as the new United Nation's Global Compacts on Refugees and Migrants.
The project will be a stepping stone in the PI's career, allowing him to lead a unique collaboration and consolidating his expertise in the region and access to basic social services. Through the project and strong mentorship, he will acquire new skills in participatory methods, develop his research leadership and network, and build solid foundations and collaborations for a large research programme on refugee livelihoods.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","UK - Research Council","economic and social research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grants","Jean-Benoit Falisse","SCHOOL OF SOCIAL & P S CENTRES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4946906",NA,299997.85,"177845.67","75191.38","46960.80","249390.44","ES/R00790X/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","New Investigator Grant","SPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-05-01,2021-04-30,"Boleslaw Czarnecki",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Unclassified"

Our rationale in this proposal is that fully understanding and making constructive use of the latent potential embodied in the idea of adaptive re-use for placemaking, job creation and economic growth demands a novel approach; in
our case, a targeted, iterative design strategy, engaging a critical mass of multi-stakeholder participants into a comprehensive and extended innovating process centered on the four pillars of preservation, financing, business models and integrated governance. We carry out case studies in Edinburgh, Zagreb and three adaptive re-use intervention locations in Portugal, to build a knowledge base and decision support capability to enable creation of successful adaptive re-use blueprints with high replicability and up-scaling potential.","CAHSS","Edinburgh College of Art","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials","Dave O'Brien","EDINBURGH COLLEGE OF ART","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4506229",NA,293076.93,"234461.54","58615.39",NA,"293076.93",NA,"NO","Research Management AS","H2020-SC5-2016-2017","ECA",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-01-01,2021-12-31,"Anna Votsi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Research Management AS,Lead,Industry,NORWAY",NA,NA,"-",NA

intellectual tradition in their own right rather than being a local inflection of a global trend. A study of economic ideas is also always a history of the people practising and living these ideas in a complex, diverse, and continually shifting political environment. Therefore, this book is also a history of ideas, professional careers
in Chinese socialist academia, and the way in which individuals navigated political challenges and forces beyond their control.","CAHSS","School of History, Classics and Archaeology","UK - Research Council","british academy","UNITED KINGDOM","ba/leverhulme small research grants","Felix Boecking","HISTORY CLASSICS & ARCHAEOLOGY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4881112",NA,9700,"9700.00","0.00",NA,"9700.00",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"HCA",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-09-01,2018-08-31,"Nisha Patel",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

Practice theory offers a method for identifying the limits and possibilities of change and practical implications for transformative low-carbon governance. Our objectives are to :
•	using practice theory, identify points for leveraging transformative change in people’s values and practices in contrasting case studies 
•	Conduct research in dialogue with key stakeholders who can take change forward..
•	Create documentation of the research process, stakeholder dialogue and lessons from comparative analysis that will inspire scaling up similar activities elsewhere.
. Our cases involve 1) legal interventions attempting to reduce emissions, 2) life-stage transition as an opportunity of fostering consumption practices change, 3) attempted lower-carbon food production in a deprived community, 4) transformative empowerment potential of off-grid and renewable energy and 5) a site of contradictory change in meat consumption practices. These cases offer contrasting constellations of non-academic partner interests and levels of power that make success in reducing carbon emissions more or less difficult. Teams from the Netherlands, Norway, the UK and India, working in high, upper- and lower-middle income contexts, will share insights developed from these practical examples on how to transform towards more sustainable societies, and map transferable principles for wider change. We will create impact through relationships with non-academic partners, their networks introducing the practice approach to policy and practitioner work and networks of academics with mutually productive research interests.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","EU - Other","new opportunities for research funding agency cooperation in europe","FINLAND","general scheme","Lynn Jamieson","SOCIOLOGY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4550297",NA,384538.8,"261308.48","123230.32",NA,"307631.04",NA,"YES","University of Edinburgh","Transformations to Sustainability (T2S)","SPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-06-01,2021-05-31,"Leon Page",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Radboud Universiteit,Collaborator,HEI,NETHERLANDS|Cicero Senter Klimaforskning Stiftelse,Collaborator,HEI,NORWAY|University of Oslo,Collaborator,HEI,NORWAY",NA,NA,"-","Unclassified"

Ourselves? Our brain? Apparently the more we get to know our own brain functions, the more the idea of freedom becomes blurred. This is mainly because many of the concepts of freedom we frequently use require a certain degree of indetermination, that is, require the idea that my actions are completely under my control. It is precisely this idea of control what clashes with the ways in which our brains produce or regulate our actions. I propose to explore the possibility of a concept of freedom that does not require indetermination and that, therefore, it can coexist without conflict with decisionrelated functions of the brain. For this purpose I will use, as a context, the thought of G. W. Leibniz, especially his Essais de Theodicée. From this concept I will try to shed some light on the issues of agency and responsibility, which are traditionally considered to be closely related to indetermination.","CAHSS","School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences","UK - Government","royal society","UNITED KINGDOM","newton international fellowship","Pauline Phemister","PHILOSOPHY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4625354",NA,86812.5,"57875.00","28937.50",NA,"86812.50",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"PPLS","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance",NA,NA,NA,"ODA","No",NA,2018-03-01,2020-02-29,"Anna Votsi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance",NA

calibration and test of ""SOPHIE"", a SOft Physiotherapy Hand Interactive Exoskeleton. SOPHIE is a portable rehabilitation
device aimed to address hand motor impairment (HMI) recovery after stroke. HMI accounts for around 60% of post stroke
disability that currently affects 3.5 million people both in the UK and Brazil. In the UK, every year an estimated 130,000
people have a stroke and the NHS costs are £8.9billion a year (5.5% of the total NHS expenditure) [1].
Currently, there are several robotic devices available for post stroke hand rehabilitation but their use has been limited either
by their very high cost, size, targeted hand movement (closing of the hand only), and/or lack of adaptability. The SOPHIE
device is portable, affordable, adaptable, aesthetically friendly, and it will help patients to recover the opening (in addition to
closing) movement of their hand after a stroke. The system will integrate a soft orthotic device developed by the UK
partners with a Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) system plus electromyography (EMG) sensors, devised by the Brazilian
applicants. Machine learning methods will be used to control device resistance and adaptability. Clinical trials will be
conducted both in the UK and Brazil.
SOPHIE will allow rehabilitation not only in the major rehabilitation centres but also in the outpatient department and
potentially at home. SOPHIE will require very little input by the trained therapist, once the patient is trained to use the
device. The same approach could be further extended in the future to aid in the recovery of lower limbs. With its combined
compact design and relatively low cost, SOPHIE has potential to revolutionise rehabilitation after stroke by increasing the
amount of therapy available, and thus has a real potential to transform lives.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Research Council","medical research council","UNITED KINGDOM","biomedical catalyst: developmental pathway funding scheme (tr)","Adam Stokes","INST OF INTEGRATED M&N SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3823032",NA,1012054.69,"734736.50","277318.20",NA,"809643.75","MR/P02758X/1","YES","Heriot-Watt University","Biomedical Catalyst: DPFS Out Dec 2016","ENG",NA,NA,NA,"Translational (TR)","NoFlag","Yes",NA,2018-04-01,2022-03-31,"Paula Stevenson","John Jeffrey","Cyril Pernet, Deanery of Clinical Sciences","John Norrie, Deanery of Molecular, Genetic and Population Health Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Heriot-Watt University,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|NHS Fife,Collaborator,Government,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"ERI - Business Development Team","Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences"

However, only 55% of awake and 80% of sleep EEGs recorded from patients with epilepsy detect one of the most widely used biomarkers of epilepsy; interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). In this project we will record and analyse recordings of NIRS in patients who will be anyway and routinely scheduled for intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). The aims are twofold; establish the NIRS IED characteristics as compared to the gold standard of iEEG recordings and develop automatic IED detection algorithms on the NIRS recordings. The results of this project will establish the ability of NIRS being a reliable biomarker for epilepsy

Investigation of near-infrared spectroscopy as a biomarker acquisition method for epilepsy with the aid of invasive electroencephalography.

The diagnostic process in epilepsy has been aided by the use of biomarkers. One of them, interictal epileptiform discharges is a useful marker, but it is not always seen in patients with epilepsy. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a non-invasive technique, has also been recently investigated as a possible method for detecting epileptiform discharges.

In this project we will record and analyse recordings of NIRS in patients who will anyway undergo intracranial electroencephalography (electrodes inside the skull, iEEG) for the localization of abnormal brain areas. Our aim is the creation and analysis, for the first time in humans, of a joint NIRS-iEEG dataset to further the development of NIRS as a biomarker for epilepsy. 
 
The relation between the electrical (iEEG) and the haemodynamic (NIRS) signatures of the discharges will be established in a robust way with extensive practical applications. Due to the ease of use of a NIRS device, the methodology will enable and encourage similar and extended studies in the future further enhancing its utility.

NIRS is a non-invasive and portable device which can be promptly incorporated as a diagnostic tool.

continuous production will ensure wider and cheaper global availability, and more

devastating diseases? How can we insightfully identify the approved therapeutic
molecules which are most efficiently amenable to continuous manufacturing, so as
to then design optimal production plants with maximised productivity and
minimised environmental impact, for the notoriously wasteful pharmaceutical
industry?

Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing is a rapidly expanding technology
pursued already by many multinational companies, but the selection of the most
suitable substances, or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) to be produced
in continuous plants is arbitrary and circumstantial. The applicant, Dr Dimitrios
Gerogiorgis, has many years of experience and leadership in process modelling,
simulation and optimisation of continuous pharma plants, and is an expert in
performing conclusive technoeconomic analyses which quantitatively establish the
extent of capital and operating cost advantages of such plants, as well as the
most promising solvents for API separation and their relative environmental
impact, for a given API. The question is: Which APIs should we be studying?

This interdisciplinary research project bridges a gap between Chemical Process
Systems Engineering and Econometrics, proposing the use of Data Analytics and
Statistical Modelling in order to analyse UK and EU demand, cost and price
trends, from reputable agency (ONR, ABPI, EMEA) pharmaceutical production
and trade databases, and thereby develop a systematic methodology

Hurricane Energy Harvesting

Energy consumption has increased considerably during the last few decades, with studies that suggest that this trend will
double around the world in the next 20 years. In parallel, renewable technologies are still suffering low efficiency rates or
considerable intermittency, whilst use of new, unconventional fossil fuels keeps increasing GHGs that will unlikely be
reduced to the pre-industrial era. This over-exploitation of fossil resources has produced a considerable addition of CO2 to
the atmosphere, warming up the planet and producing more frequent climatic phenomena such as floods, hurricanes, ice
melting, etc. As it is unlikely that civilization will mitigate both CO2 production in the short term and climate change with the
current increase of temperature, humanity needs to learn how to cope with the new climatic events that are about to come.
Therefore, it is necessary that the use of new technology leads us to the creation of devices that can produce renewable
energy in vast quantities to support global consumption, while keeping a green, zero CO2 scenario that uses these more
frequent climatic events for our advantage. In that line, High Peak, Perishable Energy (HPPE) is a concept that can
potentially change the way that we see climate change and its associated phenomena, not to stop working towards its
mitigation, but to use as much as possible of these new events to produce energy that can sustain entire communities for
months while avoiding CO2 production. In particular to this proposal, the study focuses on developing the concepts to
recover energy from hurricanes. Thus, HPPE looks into the development of concepts that can be also applied to the heat
transfer industry whilst being supported by experimentalist, legals and social researchers to create the foundations for the
development of socially ethical systems.","CSE","School of Engineering","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - future and emerging technologies","Ignazio Maria Viola","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4308865",NA,220533.65,"176426.92","44106.73",NA,"220533.65","766645","NO","University of Edinburgh","H2020-FETOPEN-2016-2017 FETOPEN-01-2016-2017 RIA","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-10-01,2021-03-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Institute for Energy Systems"

This decade’s major challenge for the EU economy is to decouple its growth from the use of resource-input or the
environmental impact-output. The use of biomass is the main opportunity for this decoupling. For this ‘third industrial
revolution’ the industry needs a group of highly skilled staff with scientific, technological, managerial and entrepreneurial
competences for the multi-disciplinary field of biomass handling and processing The efficient and safe use of biomass
becomes a fundamental concept of this revolution, given the limited and fragmented availability of the biomass feedstock.
Often the lack of knowledge and use of innovative and specific techniques for biomass characterisation, equipment and
systems design and safety causes biomass transformation plant stoppage and thus substantial losses in terms of resources,
time and money. The innovative training network “Efficient, reliable and safe biomass handling, pretreatment and processing
for a sustainable EU bio-based economy (BIOHAPPBY)” is part of the solution. By joining forces of many sectors relevant to
biomass handling, pretreatment and processing, i.e. universities and research centers, software houses, densification
equipment suppliers, storage equipment designers, safety systems providers, plant constructors, bioenergy producers and
biorefineries, BIOHAPPBY proposes the training of highly skilled, interdisciplinary experts on an international research
programme. It will provide significant advances in the scientific understanding of the physical phenomena controlling the
biomass solids behaviour in handling systems and support groundbreaking technologies for the biomass pre-treatement,

2016,2016-12-14,"Unsuccessful","3883248","architecture and homecoming: can architecture support transitions out of homelessness?","Accommodation' is not tantamount to 'home'. As 'home' is an active moment in creating individual and social identities (Short 1999), offering a stable home rather than temporary accommodation has been defended as the most successful way to end the ""degrading and dehumanising"" experience of homelessness (BBC 2016, The Guardian 2016). As recently presented at the Scottish Churches Housing Action event (BBC Scotland 2016), policies aimed at reducing homelessness, rather than managing it, should offer homeless people a place that they can call home, as in the Housing First model. However, current research highlights that evidence on how accommodation for transitions can help homeless people rebuild their social identity and help stabilise ontological security is yet limited and inconclusive (Quilgars and Pleace 2016). This project will assess how architecture can support transitions out of homelessness or homecoming by applying a novel cross-disciplinary methodology that we have developed from interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) and architectural methods and combines theory-driven explorations from architecture with those of the social sciences. Our novel approach follows a philosophical reading of homelessness as lacking a sense of belonging, and with it a sound sense of identity, together with a sense of estrangement and loneliness. As the accommodation offered to single homeless individuals plays a key role in successful homecoming, our inter-disciplinary team (architect, sociologist, psychotherapist) will examine how single homeless people re-build their self and social identities in place in order to belong to mainstream housed society. The proposed research takes the following theoretical assumptions:
a)	Homecoming equals the philosophical state of belonging, meaning and purpose.
b)	Architecture enables belonging through place-making.
c)	The ontological passage from homelessness to homecoming involves negotiating estrangement (Strand A), stigma (Strand B) and loneliness (Strand C) in place.

The research identifies three interlinked strands that frame the over-arching research question on architecture supporting transitions: from estrangement to dwelling (A), from stigma to a sound sense of self-identity (B) and from loneliness to a new social-identity (C). By means of a novel in-depth longitudinal elicitation of how single homeless participants in transition negotiate estrangement, stigma and loneliness in place, the proposed research will bring forth the role of architecture supporting homecoming and inform architectural theories of place-making. Dissemination beyond the research community will share the novel multifaceted account of transitions in place through a dedicated project experiential exhibition and symposium titled 'Architecture and homecoming'","CAHSS","School of Health in Social Science","UK - Research Council","arts and humanities research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grant - standard","Jonathan Wyatt","COUNSELLING,PSYCHOTHERAPY &ASS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3883248",NA,229362.43,"136858.74","92503.70",NA,"183489.95",NA,"NO","University of Northumbria",NA,"HiSS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-10-01,2020-09-30,"Craig Landt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Northumbria,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

Activity guidelines include the advice that adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate activity each week. Moderate activity is exercise that makes someone breathe faster, but not so fast that they can’t hold a conversation. People with LTMCs are more likely to be less active than their peers. People have described this to us as ‘a double hit’ on their lives; they already have a painful and/or, disabling condition and then, by being less active, they are at greater risk than their peers of getting other conditions too (such as heart disease, some cancers, depression, stroke and diabetes). The number of people with LTMCs is rising in line with the aging population and so, in addition to the impact of these conditions on the daily lives of people living with them, this is placing a further financial burden on the already stretched NHS.

“Walk150” is a walking programme (website and podcasts) to help people with LTMCs and low levels of physical activity to gradually and safely increase their activity. By the end of the programme, people walk 150 minutes per week (at moderate/vigorous levels of activity). We have already worked with people with LTMCs to develop the ‘Walk 150’ programme which consists of individual physiotherapy assessments backed up by on-line information and podcasts.  A pilot study found that it is well liked by people with LTMCs and that it may be producing worthwhile increases in physical performance and levels of physical activity. We are now proposing a larger study to find out if out if the programme has worthwhile sustained long term effects on physical function and activity in this group. We will measure how far (in metres) people can walk during a 6 Minute Walking test; this tells us about how quickly someone can walk, about their endurance, about their trunk and leg muscle strength, about their balance and their quality of life. We will also measure how many steps people walk a day and the effect of “Walk150” on symptoms (pain, fatigue), quality of life, the amount and type of physical activity people are doing, their mood and happiness and the cost effectiveness of the “Walk150” programme.

We will do these measures when people join the study, and at 3 and 12 months to see how people do over time. People with a LTMC will be on the project management team. If “Walk150” is effective we will produce a downloadable package, with training materials and podcasts, so that the programme becomes available for free use by others within and outside the NHS. We will publish the results in freely downloadable respected medical journals, our website and send our press releases to charities and magazines. It is our hope that “Walk150” will help both people living with LTMCs to become able to be more active and help the NHS to effectively treat this growing number of patients in a cost- effective way in the future.","CAHSS","Moray House Education and Sport","UK - Government","national institute for health research","UNITED KINGDOM","public health research (phr)","Paul Kelly","INST SPORT PHYSICAL EDUC HEALT","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3809842",NA,37149.62,"27460.49","9689.12",NA,"29719.69",NA,"NO","Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust",NA,"MHSES",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-09-01,2020-08-31,"Craig Landt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,Lead,Charity,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

Evidence of varying quality, such as anecdotes, case studies and expert opinion, whilst the stuff of which hypotheses are made, is often not considered amenable to modern scientific analyses. Yet evidence of varying quality is being quantified and used by a new generation of scientists/statisticians. This project will explore what the history of experimental philosophy/science reveals about this quiet revolution and the reasons for differing attitudes to evidence of varying quality and determine the philosophical, statistical and practical constraints in using such evidence. Is the use of evidence of varying quality bad (pseudo-)science or just science with imperfect data? What forms of evidence are used by scientists and statisticians? Could this evidence be used with equal rigour in the social sciences and humanities? Thus we will document the attitude towards evidence of varying quality of Bacon and the early experimental philosophers, the influence of Enlightenment philosophers like Hume and Reid on scientists' thoughts about anecdotes, the development of statistics and its relation to scientists' use of evidence of varying quality and data, scientific attitudes towards natural history anecdotes in 19th century, the history of phenology, the history of scientific attitudes to eyewitness testimony and contemporary scientific attitudes to evidence of varying quality in the broad sense especially the emergence of Bayesian perspectives. The aim will be not only to document the history of data within science and the usages of different types of information but above all, to suggest robust methods for the handling of anecdotes and related types of information within 21st century science and scholarship more generally (i.e. in the social sciences and humanities). Finally the project may shed some wholly new light on the demarcation problem by considering the nature of the actual material under consideration by scientists, a perspective almost completely untouched in current histories of science.","CAHSS","School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences","UK - Research Council","arts and humanities research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grant - standard","Duncan Pritchard","PHIL, PSYCH & LANG SCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=2759408",NA,90815.84,"70706.34","20109.50",NA,"72652.67",NA,"NO","University of St Andrews",NA,"PPLS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-04-01,2021-03-31,"Ayesha Sodha",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of St Andrews,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

Drug and alcohol problems do not only affect those misusing substances but also the family members of the substance user and are strongly linked to problems such as domestic violence, homelessness, crime and child maltreatment.
County Durham is the most deprived area in the north-east region of the United Kingdom (UK). Changes to the commissioning of services as well as substantial cuts to funding mean that difficult decisions are having to be made in relation to services. This research will seek to explore the impact of these economic pressures and sector restructuring on the region’s drug and alcohol service provision. To do this we will interview service users, commissioners, and practitioners to explore the recent changes.
This research involves researchers and practitioners working together to carry out the research, enabling shared learning. Firstly we will work with County Durham staff and service users to further develop the questions that are important to them and to service users. We will then carry out interviews and focus groups with service users and staff. We expect these interviews will focus on what staff and service users think about changes to provision because of cuts to services and how this is impacting on them. We will work together on analysing the focus groups and writing up the results as well as providing a case study to be used by other councils. As well as writing up the report for the funder and for academic journals/conference we will host a conference (with FUSE) in the north east of England to disseminate the findings. Moreover we will develop factsheets to be used by practitioners and short podcasts that will be available on the Teesside University and Durham Council websites as well as on ‘youtube’.","CAHSS","School of Health in Social Science","UK - Charity","alcohol research uk","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Aisha Holloway","NURSING STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3902047",NA,2060.99,"2060.99","0.00",NA,"2060.99",NA,"NO","Teeside University",NA,"HiSS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-06-01,2018-11-30,"Craig Landt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Teeside University,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

Recovery can be a challenging and fluctuating journey and individual support needs vary throughout. Services for people in recovery have changed significantly in recent years with emphasis being placed on solutions and service-user experiences rather than traditional treatment approaches. However, the ‘key ingredients’ of services that help people to sustain recovery are not yet fully understood. 
A recent study carried out by this team highlighted the importance of supportive social spaces where people meet informally and can socialise with those who have experienced the recovery journey. The proposed study firstly aims to understand more about the ‘active ingredients’ which make socially supportive spaces and informal peer-support important to the maintenance of recovery. Secondly, the project aims to understand the relationships between recovery and personal identity over time, exploring the ways in which people incorporate recovery into their daily lives and the role of supportive social environments in that transition. 
In times of austerity the relatively inexpensive supportive café model could be influential in facilitating sustained recovery, allowing service-users to develop occupational and social roles while enjoying responsive peer-support. This study is important because it seeks to understand the key factors that make the model work, providing a framework from which future policy and service provision can be developed.
The project is innovative in a number of ways. Firstly, this application includes two service-user/peer researchers from Serenity Café. Secondly, the project uses photovoice, an innovative research approach, allowing participants to use photography to explore experiences. Finally, this project will co-produce photographic materials which enable the Café to disseminate findings in exciting ways such as exhibitions, engaging display boards, innovative evidence submissions to key stakeholders and public engagement.","CAHSS","School of Health in Social Science","UK - Charity","alcohol research uk","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Sarah Rhynas","NURSING STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3840340","RA4023",57510.92,"57510.92","0.00",NA,"57510.92","R 2017/3","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"HiSS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-08-01,2019-03-31,"Craig Landt",NA,"Aisha Holloway, School of Health in Social Science","Fiona Cuthill, School of Health in Social Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

There is some evidence that young asylum seekers and those who become destitute following the asylum process engage in risky alcohol use, but little is known about the ways that asylum seekers use alcohol, the circumstances associated with misuse or pathways to recovery. This is particularly important at a time when the political climate is increasingly hostile to asylum seekers and the consequences of this are likely to exacerbate the distress they experience. Increasingly research is expanding our understanding of the pathways that people take into harmful alcohol use and recovery. As the idea of ‘recovery’ has been investigated, it is now understood to be much more than merely a reduction in alcohol use, but includes non-health benefits such as housing and improved social relationships. Research that listens to the ‘voices’ of individuals who have experienced harmful alcohol use has been instrumental in uncovering these new ideas and understanding of recovery. Nonetheless, the experience of people who are hard-to-reach has been largely absent from this body of research. This project intends to include the use of two researchers from the refugee community to interview 20-25 people to explore risky alcohol use and experiences of recovery amongst people seeking asylum in the UK. The PI has significant experience of successfully working with refugee researchers and has an established relationship, and therefore access to this hard-to-reach group. This innovative partnership study will provide us with an increased understanding of the ways that experiences during forced migration influence risky alcohol use and recovery.","CAHSS","School of Health in Social Science","UK - Charity","alcohol research uk","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Fiona Cuthill","NURSING STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3852932",NA,59190.24,"59190.25","0.00",NA,"59190.24",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"HiSS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-08-01,2018-07-31,"Craig Landt",NA,"Aisha Holloway, School of Health in Social Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Teeside University,Partner,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

It will explore how impacts can be most appropriately assessed, how benefits should be defined and delivered, and how both of these can influence public and stakeholder responses to the wind farm.  
The project will combine all three of the suggested research theme sub-topics to produce a comprehensive understanding of the key socio-economic issues.  More specifically it will:
-	Conduct longitudinal research to assess change: we will apply our previous published research on the way in which public responses to on- and off-shore wind farms can change over time to understand the key factors that matter, how they vary, and how shape public perceptions
-	Use innovative methods to explore value and meaning:  we will draw on our research for the Scottish Government on assessing socio-economic impacts of marine energy to holistically understand a range of different impacts that occur throughout the lifetime of the project, and how these can best be managed
-	Apply a novel benefits framework: we established, in an innovative framework developed for the Scottish Government, that definitions of relevant communities, impacts, and benefits from offshore wind energy are inescapably related to each other.  In this project, we will apply this framework to develop a comprehensive understanding of how impacts from the wind farm are shaped, how relevant communities can be involved, and how benefits can ensured.
Our research would be academically rigorous yet focused on targeted outcomes and policy relevant findings.

2015,2016-07-21,"Unsuccessful","3274780","economic lives and survival strategies of 'repeat' refugees: learning from mixed-methods surveys amongst the burundians of north-western tanzania","The mainstream approach to refugee protection, which limits refugee work rights, is often ill-suited to modern crises where
protracted and repeat instability prevents a durable mass return to countries of origin. On the ground, refugees in protracted crisis have often developed ad hoc income generating activities and safety nets, informally and sometimes across borders. This is especially true for the cases of re-displacements, the many hot spots in the world where repeat refugees are intermittently leaving from and returning to fragile countries, often from and to countries that are already
extremely poor and sometimes themselves unstable. Little is understood of such 'repeat refugees' economies', and advances in the field require a socio-economic analysis that is deeply sensitive to history and the cycles of returns and departures. By adopting this approach, the present study will not only expand the frontier of current refugee and peace building research, but it will also participate in a complete rethinking of refugee assistance and refugee crisis prevention and resolution.
The focus of this project is on the Burundians who have found shelter in Tanzania in the past year. According to World Food Programme experts, 60 to 80% of them could be repeat refugees. Anecdotal evidence from researchers and aid organisations suggest key areas of investigations that are also clear gaps in the existing literature on refugees: (1) the flow of Burundians is mixed, with 'official' refugees who go to camps, but also less 'legal' migrants who purposely avoid the camps and reportedly tap into cross-border networks for survival; (2) the strict encampment policy does prevent income generating activities to 'illegally' develop in the camps ; and (3) some of the latest humanitarian innovations In Tanzanian are around developing income generating activities for the refugees.
The core of the project consists of a mixed-methods survey of the repeat Burundian refugees in Tanzania, inside and outside refugee camps, allowing a comparison between refugees who benefited from income-oriented aid programmes from aid organisations and refugees who have not. The main methods for investigating the livelihoods of the refugees are household surveys that are inspired by recent work in economics but also history. The surveys include a module on the household history of displacement and economic activity. These data are complemented with in-depth focus groups and interviews with groups of refugees, who, based on the survey data, seem to present an interesting perspective for thickening and explaining the trends unveiled by the survey. Finally, because some behaviours may be hard to comprehend through surveys and even longer qualitative interviews, participatory mapping of economic activities and a series of behavioural games on assessing the level of trust and collective action will be organised with the refugees. The
originality of the methodological approach is, therefore, double: it combines methods and looks at economic activity through time.
The project will bring together researchers based in the UK with Burundian and Tanzanian researchers and involve key stakeholders such as policy-makers, aid organisations, and the refugees themselves at the different stages of the project (design, implementation, analysis, and dissemination of results). Standard methods of data analysis such as regression models and network and discourse analysis will be combined with innovative forms of output delivery such as interactive maps and infographics. Another key output of the research will be workshops and bilateral with policy-makers and other stakeholders that will be devised to help integrate the findings of the research into policies about refugee welfare and local economic development and could also contribute to the re-starting the social and political dialogue in Burundi.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","UK - Research Council","economic and social research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grants","Jean-Benoit Falisse","SCHOOL OF SOCIAL & P S CENTRES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3274780",NA,298030.9,"164134.79","76416.10","57480.00","249920.72",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","GCRF ESRC/AHRC Forced Displacement call","SPS","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2016-10-01,2018-09-30,"Joanna Wielgo","Laura Cockram",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA

2.1. Fostering renewable energies and energy efficiency
Technology transfer and university-enterprise cooperation, Renewable energy: marine

Wave energy is called upon to play a role in the European energy mix but
significant obstacles still exist. SIWEIS will foster wave energy growth through
integration with other maritime uses (transport, energy, aquaculture). Using
Blue Economy priority sectors, 5 main obstacles will be addressed: reliability;
survivability; sustainability; LCOE and environmental integration. The main
outputs will be a GIS tool and an integrated strategy to leverage wave energy
under a transnational approach.

The aim of this project is to achieve sustainable integration of wave energy
into the AA economy by means of innovative synergies with other maritime
activities (transport, energy, aquaculture & support services). Wave
energy is one of the most promising marine renewable resources and one
of the Blue Growth Priorities. Almost 45% of wave energy developers are
European and a new, homegrown industrial sector is emerging. However, the
wave energy sector is at a crucial stage where cost and risk reduction are
needed in order to attract investors. The overarching objective of SIWEIS is
to develop an integrated AA strategy to accelerate wave energy development
from basic research to demonstration projects, through the integration of wave
energy converters with existing and mature maritime economic activities.
Three specific objectives will be addressed: (1) identify synergies between
wave energy and other maritime activities and classify the AA potential
for a multiuse maritime space approach; (2) cluster wave energy resource
availability, focusing on met-ocean conditions, socio-economic benefits and
synergies with other uses; (3) identify the most relevant technological needs
for wave energy developers in the AA in order to maximize the rate of success
and minimize risks/costs of demonstration projects. The results obtained
from SIWEIS will impact on the current situation by characterizing the socioeconomic
impact of wave energy development and integration in the AA.","CSE","School of Engineering","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","interreg iv","Henry Jeffrey","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3028360",NA,160714.28,"142546.43","18167.86",NA,"120535.71","EAPA_374/2016","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-06-01,2020-05-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Adrian De Andres, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Institute for Energy Systems"

The specific aims of the proposal are:

(i) To develop a deeper understanding of the collaborative economy phenomenon in all its aspects, by studying in-depth the sociotechnical systems and human practices involved, comparing and reflecting upon local, regional, national and international initiatives;

(ii) To discuss and critique elements of the current discourse on the collaborative economy, and proposing a richer definition and characterisation of the phenomenon;

(iii) To formulate a European research agenda for the socio-technical aspects of the collaborative economy, including specifically the design of future technological platforms, the technical infrastructure, their legal, ethical and financial implications;

(iv) To articulate a European research perspective on the collaborative economy, based on EU values of social innovation, and in line with the Europe 2020 strategy objective to become a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy by 2020.

Comparing reading strategies used by hearing and deaf children –who show different visuo-spatial skills - can provide new insights into the relationship between language and more general cognitive abilities. We will compare online reading strategies (i.e., the use of graphics, text,

It is not that far away. Real-time rendering of photo-realistic facial animation is just around the corner. Text-to-speech synthesis is already as intelligible as human speech and is getting more natural every year. To prepare for this world, in which computer generated content will be intermingled with the natural, there is a fundamental need to understand how human beings can preserve the awareness of what is real and what is not. This main objective can be further specified into 4 major facets thatcombine scientific understanding with practical benefits:
1. Discover the characteristics of human perception of computer-generated imitations of humans, to explore the edges of
lifelike characters creation.
2. An understanding of how interactions between humans and computer-generated characters affect human emotional
processing, perception and decision-making.
3. New techniques for automatic detection of computer-generated images and speech, necessary to maintain trust in online
content and computer-mediated communication, and confidence in facial- and speech-based authentication.
4. An evaluation of the societal impact of widespread computer-generated content, considering trust, acceptance and ethics.
PSI-BORG will achieve these objectives with novel interdisciplinary research that brings together methods from computer vision (facial analysis), computer graphics (photo-realistic rendering and animation), speech processing (speech synthesis), forensics & biometrics (speaker verification, identification), cognitive neuroscience & psychophysics (reaction time, detection, galvanic skin response, brain activity), and ethics.

The European Commission estimates that 3%- 4% of global N2O emissions and 9% of global CH4 emissions derive from (WWTP).

Within such a framework, Membrane-Assisted Simultaneous Capture and Catalytic Abatement of N2O and CH4 from waste water treatment plant emissions (MASCCA) project aims at directly addressing the problem of non-CO2 GHG emissions of N2O and CH4

Three million tonnes of adipic acid are produced each year, representing a market value of $5.6 billion. However, despite predicted increases in the demand for adipic acid in the future, due to a growing population, this cannot occur due to environmental regulations imposed as a result of the unacceptable levels of greenhouse gasses emitted from this industrial process. In particular, adipic acid production releases nitric oxide, a greenhouse gas 300-times more damaging than CO2, and is responsible for 10% of N2O emissions worldwide. Therefore, new greener methods for the production of adipic acid are urgently required. Here, we will assess the ability of genetically modified bacteria to convert fish waste into adipic acid under mild conditions via a pathway that avoids the release of N2O.","CSE","School of Biological Sciences","UK - Government","scottish funding council","UNITED KINGDOM","industrial biotechnology (ibioic) (tr)","Stephen Wallace","SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10441610","RA5450",20996.77,"14916.81","6079.97",NA,"16797.42","FF-2021-01","NO","University of Edinburgh","Feasibility Programme November 2020","BIO",NA,NA,NA,"Translational (TR)","NoFlag","No",NA,2021-04-01,2021-06-30,"Laura Bonsall","John Morrow",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Impact Solutions,Partner,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","ERI - Business Development Team,DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)",NA

Syngas, which contains CO and H2 is produced by pyrolysis from a broad range of carbon based material including problematic wastes. This project investigates the use of screening waste from food waste anaerobic digestion for syngas production. This abundant waste contains both plastic and biobased substances and is usually sent to landfill at high disposal costs. Thus, owners of food waste AD plants are looking for alternative ways to valorise it. Carbogenics’ new syngas fermentation technology can unlock the conversion of screening waste by means of pyrolysis and subsequent syngas biomethanisation. In this project, Carbogenics will bring in its technical and commercial knowledge in the areas of pyrolysis and fermentation, while UoE will contribute with its world-renowned scientific expertise in applied microbial ecology (Free lab).","CSE","School of Biological Sciences","UK - Government","scottish funding council","UNITED KINGDOM","industrial biotechnology (ibioic) (tr)","Andrew Free","INST QUANTITIVE BIOLOGY, B & B","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9966457","RA5196",18749.54,"11918.89","6830.64",NA,"14999.63","FF-2020-10","NO","Carbogenics Ltd","Feasibility Programme April 2020","BIO",NA,NA,NA,"Translational (TR)","NoFlag","No",NA,2020-09-01,2021-02-28,"Laura Bonsall","Emma Elliott",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Carbogenics Ltd,Lead,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","ERI - Business Development Team,Award Indicative Successful,DDI Hub - Bayes Centre",NA

2018,2019-01-28,"Pending","7861922","reduction of landfill gas and leachate pollution from solid waste landfill via implementation of 2-dimensional nanomaterial mixed matrix membranes (mmms) to foster a green and sustainable environment","Industrialization, rapid urbanization and population explosion in recent decades have 
increased solid waste generation that creates substantial challenges on solid waste 
management. In India, only 43 metric tons of solid waste is collected annually out of 
which 27.9% waste are treated and 72% waste are dumped in landfill. Landfill gas (LFG) 
is generated owing to the decomposition of solid waste. LFG contains greenhouse 
gases (GHGs) and methane (CH4). LFG emission to the atmosphere without proper 
treatment could increase greenhouse gas emission and has a great impact on global 
climate change. Percolation of water via landfill generates leachate which contains 
complex organic and inorganic contaminants. Leachate treatment is needed for 
protecting subsurface and surface water resources from deterioration. In analogous, the 
effect of solid waste is interconnected with the air, water pollution and spreading of 
diseases.  
The concern on solid waste alone is not enough but focusing direction on LFG and 
leachate management would alleviate pollution that sound well in developing 
sustainable environment for mankind. Among numerous technologies, membrane 
technology is one of the most energy-efficient alternatives for separating LFG and 
leachate treatment. Membrane technology has smaller footprint, low energy 
consumption and eco-friendly than the conventional treatment. The idea of this project is 
to efficiently separate LFG (CO2 and CH4) and leachate using membrane technology. 
Joint collaboration (India and UK)  would aid in transferring skills and technology that 
would promote novel solutions to the existing problem, foster safe environment and 
anticipated outcome would meets the constraints of the scientific, engineering and 
community members. Further, managing LFG and leachate using membrane technology 
would render significance to various environmental developments such as promote 
energy (CO2 and CH4 separation), sustainable resources for mankind, reduce climate 
change finally reduces impact of solid waste disposed at landfill.","CSE","School of Engineering","Overseas - Other","uk-india education and research initiative","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Harvey Huang","INSTI OF MATERIALS & PROCESSES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7861922",NA,24520,"24520.00","0.00",NA,"24520.00",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","Research Proposals","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-04-01,2021-03-31,"Jennifer Loukes",NA,"Sam Lau, School of Engineering","Rupert Myers, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

2017,2018-05-09,"Successful","6603468","molecular up-cycling: bio-transforming waste plastic into value-added products","It is estimated that 8 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the oceans each year and that by 2050 there could be more
plastic in the seas by weight than fish. This plastic is both incredibly dangerous to marine ecosystems and also sequesters
materials prepared from non-renewable fossil fuels, with just ~14% currently being recycled globally each year. It has been
estimated that recycling the remaining 86% of plastics could generate up to $120bn, but new methods and processes to
transform waste plastic into value-added products must be developed in order to realise this potential. The proposed
research will focus on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as a feedstock for a bio-based 'molecular up-cycling' platform to
produce value-added, industrially relevant small molecules. PET accounts for 15% of plastic waste in the UK, out of which
~60% is accounted for by synthetic fibres and 30% by plastic bottles, whilst other uses include plastic wrappers and films
and thermoforming for manufacturing. Although chemical and thermal methods for PET recycling are well-established,
there is a dramatic loss in value throughout the plastic life-cycle, with the value of the waste PET bottles being 86% lower
than the virgin polymer.
This Fellowship proposal unites cutting edge research from both the chemical and biological sciences to transform waste
PET into high-value small molecules. The research will address the global plastic waste disaster twofold by (i) decreasing
the amount of plastic waste deposited in the environment in the future and (ii) transforming pre-existing, low-value waste
products into industrially relevant, value-added products via a new 'molecular up-cycling' process. The research will be
organised into two phases. Initially, a robust and efficient plastic degradation process will be developed. This will exploit
PET degrading enzymes that have been isolated from microbes found in landfill sites, which have evolved to use PET as a
carbon source for growth. In the second phase, the PET degradation technology will be integrated with 'microbial cell
factories', which we will genetically programme to turn the degradation products of PET into industrially relevant small
molecules. The initial target of the project will be the synthesis of vanillin - the primary extract from the vanilla bean and the
primary molecule responsible for the characteristic smell and taste of vanilla. Vanillin is used extensively for flavours and
fragrances and is also a valuable intermediate in the production of fine chemicals such as pharmaceuticals. As such, it has
huge commercial value, with the global market for vanillin estimated to reach $724.5 million by 2025. Beyond this, the
project also holds great potential for the production of a range of other high-value small molecules which are accessible
through developing and integrating novel, bio-compatible chemical reactions with the PET degradation system. Such compounds include pharmaceuticals, fragrance/flavouring compounds, agrochemicals and polymers. As such, it is
anticipated that this project will have significant academic and industrial value, as well having a positive impact on the
environment by removing plastic waste from the natural environment.","CSE","School of Biological Sciences","UK - Research Council","biotechnology and biological sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","fellowship","Joanna Sadler","SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6603468","RA4678",344200.36,"219793.36","124407.00",NA,"275360.29","BB/S010629/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Discovery Fellowships - 9th May 2018 Committee D","BIO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-09-01,2022-08-31,"Veronica Brivio",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)",NA

eco-friendly as it obviates the emission of hazardous fumes and toxic gases by current
pyrolysis and high temperature methods adopted by recyclers. Also, solvent extraction
techniques for the separation of metals can be applied at the site of collection of waste
electronics, so benefiting the local economy and limiting transport of materials. Being

The BioMeLT project aims at developing new and innovative technologies for converting bioresidues or biowaste and excess
renewable electricity to liquefied biomethane (LBM) for maritime and heavy-duty road transport and reducing GHG
emissions and pollutants in Europe. The BioMeLT process shall be implemented to existing small and medium scale
(bio-)waste treatment plants switching to Pt-LBM mode whenever excess renewable electricity is available. For the BioMeLT
process, e.g. the unused EU municipal solid biowaste potential can be applied, covering the EU transport sector fuel
capacity.
As biomass gasification results in the most critical gas, the WoodRoll® gasification technology from CE will serve as uniform
starting point for evaluating the BioMeLT process chain. For small and decentralized application, a simple and robust
methanation concept is favourable in terms of costs and user-friendly operation. Therefore, three new and innovative
Biological Methanation (BM) concepts will be evaluated, covering intrinsic kinetics, optimization of mass transfer and back
coupling effects on the entire process chain. The project will contribute to extending the knowledge in the field of BM, which
will help to quantify the potentials of this promising technology. In parallel to the research on BM, gas upgrading and
liquefaction technologies will be optimized and adapted to the process chain’s needs. Sound reactor modelling will allow
scale-up of the process chain to demonstrator scale directly. The industrial partners cover the scope of all applied
technologies and will contribute to transferring the results into the market.
The implementation strategy and the use of renewable electricity complies with the EC SET plan and H2020 perspectives of
applying interconnections between the energy networks and offering power grid storage and flexibilization options.
Furthermore, it gives the EU LNG strategy a green perspective in short to mid term by substitution of LNG by LBM.","CSE","School of Engineering","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - secure, clean and efficient energy","Stefano Brandani","INSTI OF MATERIALS & PROCESSES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4048811",NA,230506.53,"184405.23","46101.30",NA,"230506.53","764041-1","NO","University of Edinburgh","H2020-LCE-2016-2017 LCE-06-2017","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-01-01,2020-12-31,"Paula Stevenson",NA,"Enzo Mangano, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Institute for Materials and Processes"

2016,2016-09-15,"Pending","3610463","enabling bio co2 capture technologies for the european waste-to-energy sector","Outline:

Climate change and waste management are societal challenges that have high priority as demonstrated
by the first universal climate agreement adopted by 195 countries at the Paris COP21 in 2016 and the
EU action plan for the Circular Economy Package, setting clear targets on waste management and
recycling to develop a sustainable, low carbon, resource efficient and competitive economy in the
future. Non-recyclable waste logically finds its role by feeding back its energy content in heating,
cooling and electricity production, compatible with the 7th Environment Action Programme to phase
out landfilling in the EU, and to develop a resource-efficient, green, and competitive low-carbon
economy. According to the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP) 88.4 Mt of
waste were thermally treated in Europe in 2014 in 455 plants, corresponding to an equal amount of
CO2 emissions (following the IPCC methodology), and generating 38 TWh of electricity and 88
TWh of heat. According to EUROSTAT only 13% of municipal solid waste (MSW) were energy
recovered in 2013, with a great disparity between the countries. These facts are a striking evidence of
the large potential for both retrofit and greenfield commercial CO2 capture projects for the waste-toenergy
(WtE) sector in the short term. Additionally, it is accepted that a fraction of 33% to 50% of
waste is of biogenic origin, therefore enhancing the CO2 reduction potential of the WtE sector through
the possible concept of carbon negativity (bio-CCS). The need for carbon negative solutions can be an
opportunity to introduce CCS to large CO2 emitters at community service level. Although there is little
public acceptance of CCS in the WtE to the applicants’ knowledge, it could attract for support from
stakeholders in the same way that CCS in heavy industries does. The WtE sector is not included in EU
Emissions Trading System and will not have access to flexible mechanisms and possibilities within
ETS. To follow-up on the EU 2030 targets of 40% reduction, cuts will have to be taken by the sector
itself. As such, the CapeWaste project intends to be a reference project in CCS applied to the WtE
sector in Europe. The unique application of CO2 capture technology to a WtE plant, as known by the
applicants, is the pilot tests performed at the Klemetsrud plant near Oslo in 2016. According to the
public information available, the project has shown that conventional post-combustion CO2 capture is
technically feasible. In parallel to the roadmap from the EC Communi-cation Initiative on waste to
energy, the CapeWaste project will address technological, commercial and societal issues for
introducing CO2 capture into the WtE sector. CapeWaste intends to progress a panel of technologies
for retrofit and greenfield plants, that have the potential to achieve further improvement in efficiency
and costs in the WtE sector.

Climate change and waste management are two high priority societal challenges as demonstrated by Paris COP21 and the EU's Circular Economy Package, setting clear targets on waste management and low carbon economy for the future. CO2 capture from the waste sector is an industrial initiative that addresses both challenges with the added potential for being carbon negative (Bio-CCUS) and stimulating job creation. Recent feasibility studies and pilot scale testing at Waste-to-Energy sites in Norway, the Netherlands, and the UK, are strong drivers to establish a European project gathering a convincing consortium in order to advance selected CO2 capture solutions for a challenging fuel like waste. CapeWaste intends to address the challenges of selected capture technologies that have a potential for large scale demonstration within 2025. These technologies are categorized as suited for retrofit (solvent based and calcium looping), and greenfield applications (oxy-fuel combustion and oxy-sorbent enhanced reforming gasification. To accelerate the deployment of these technologies, lessons must be learned at a scale that benefits the industrial development, therefore several pilot operation activities are planned in a total of four industrial sites and several large scale laboratory facilities. One example is the delivery of the basis for a pre-FEED of the potential future Norwegian Haraldrud Waste-to-Energy plant (EGE) with oxy-fuel CO2 capture. An in-depth analysis of selected technologies will be performed through environmental assessment by combining Life Cycle Analysis and scenario modelling tools. Policy aspects is also included to analyze the implication of CCS from the waste sector as a carbon negative solution. 24 partners (research, academic, industry, agency) from Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and UK form an experienced project consortium with access to top class facilities.","CSE","School of Engineering","Overseas - Other","research council of norway, the","NORWAY","general scheme","Mathieu Lucquiaud","INSTI OF MATERIALS & PROCESSES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3610463",NA,474961.54,"340020.77","134940.77",NA,"383353.85",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","ACT - Accelerating CCS Technologies ERA-Net Cofund ACT call","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-08-01,2020-07-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Gareth Harrison, School of Engineering","Hannah Chalmers, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ERI - Business Development Team","Institute for Energy Systems"

2016,2017-05-25,"Successful","5024247","reuse, recycling, and redemption in buddhist manuscripts","Issues of life and death in Japanese Buddhist art revolved around reuse and recycling. Yet because these practices have been overlooked, we do not fully understand the creative ways in which the living channelled their grief and ensured better karmic outcomes for dead loved ones. Focusing on Buddhist palimpsests, in which new text is transcribed on top of existing writing, this project explores how medieval Buddhists observed the deceased’s memory and recovered their presence after death. Mourners copied sacred text on repurposed letters directly atop the original writing or on the paper’s back. These textual compositions challenge art historical notions of  foreground/background and dominant/periphery. In some cases, the original letter was deconstructed and reformed into new paper, exposing a radical concept that presence is embedded even within the fibres of paper itself. These neglected yet fecund manuscripts thus draw together critical themes of memory, embodiment, and medieval recycling in ways that resonate across cultures and disciplines looking at the materiality of death.","CAHSS","Edinburgh College of Art","UK - Research Council","british academy","UNITED KINGDOM","ba/leverhulme small research grants","Halle O'Neal","HISTORY OF ART","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=5024247","R45081",8561,"8561.00","0.00",NA,"8561.00","SG170894","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"ECA",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-09-04,2019-09-30,"Anna Votsi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

Advances in knowledge and understanding over the past decade have enabled the design of biological systems that make compounds such as medicines, materials and fuels that are essential in our everyday lives. These products can be made directly from renewable resources using biological means, offering a route to a net neutral carbon economy. However, real world application of these technologies continues to be challenging as biology has vast complexity and our understanding of these systems is limited. The aim of this research is to address both of these problems through the combination of chemical design and enzyme engineering, which will allow the introduction of a new independent biological energy circuit into bacteria and develop a new biological reaction for use in sustainable compound production. In summary, the project will expand the number of possible reactions that can be programmed into biological systems ensuring diversification of the bioeconomy and the drive toward a sustainable future.","CSE","School of Biological Sciences","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","fellowship","Stephen Wallace","SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10699452",NA,444477.49,"311400.49","133077.00",NA,"355581.99","EP/W007347/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","EPSRC postdoctoral fellowship","BIO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2021-12-01,2024-11-30,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ingenza Ltd,Partner,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM|Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre (IBioIC),Partner,Government,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"External Applicant",NA

produced inside the buildings and to make use of this clean source of energy for generating sustainable power to Internet-ofThings (IoT). To reach this innovative objective, the ground approach is based on the best proven technology for this type of
application, namely indoor dye-sensitized solar cells technology (indoor-DSC) (TRL3) with including specific development in
terms of materials (dye, electrolyte, cell structure optimization) in order to reach 45 % power conversion efficiency under 200
– 1000 lux range power from LEDs. Going beyond materials tailoring and lab-device optimization towards module levels,
NEST will encompass also new technological innovations for DSC modules with the development of ultra-thin flexible glass
modules of up to 70 cm2 including a laser-sealed hybrid glass-frit encapsulation. NEST technology will burgeon important
advances towards a low-cost, lightweight and ultra-thin module adapted to sustainable IoTs in order to render them totally
portative and powered without means of plug-in recharge or grid-connections. IoTs will be soon a mass product, NEST
anticipates recyclability activities of the module components including systematic LCA loop calculations towards reaching
second-life DSC modules with specific objectives in terms of performances.","CSE","School of Chemistry","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - future and emerging technologies","Neil Robertson","CHEMISTRY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10191409",NA,370558.6,"296446.88","74111.72",NA,"370558.60",NA,"NO","French National Center for Scientific Research (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique)","FET Proactive: emerging paradigms and communities","CHE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2021-03-01,2025-02-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Newcastle,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM| French National Center for Scientific Research (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique),Lead,Government,FRANCE|Ecole Polytechniqe Federale de Lausanne,Collaborator,Industry,SWITZERLAND|Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,Collaborator,Industry,ITALY",NA,NA,"Application Indicative Submitted",NA

Exceptions are rare, especially when it comes to capturing the role, challenges and aspirations of local youth. The project seeks to address this gap in research and scholarship by generating knowledge on Myanmar's youth (one in two people is below the age of 30). Integrating insights from the sociology of youth, urban studies and political economy , this project seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of Myanmar's youth, its aspirations, challenges and potential. Focusing on the cases of Yangon, Mandalay, and Lashio, it uses the creative economy as a vantage point to generate knowledge on this issue and arts and practice-methods to empower and amplify the voices and skills

threatened with extinction. Population declines are primarily due to overfishing, either through targeted
fisheries, or as bycatch, particularly within tuna fisheries. Despite increasing recognition of these issues,
significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the distribution and population structure of most elasmobranchs,
resulting in limited fisheries regulation or conservation management planning at a national level.
Sri Lanka operates a significant tuna-fishing fleet and, partly as a consequence, has one of the world’s largest
multi-species elasmobranch bycatch fisheries and as such, is a key focal country for elasmobranch
biodiversity conservation. There is an urgent need to develop alternative, sustainable, fishing and commercial
trade practices at a national level however, to date there is little awareness of the opportunities and benefits of
such approaches among the Sri Lankan fishing industry.
This project aims to support management of Indian Ocean elasmobranch populations through delivering
biological data to inform Sri Lankan fisheries policy, developing national capacity for monitoring, control and
surveillance of shark and ray fisheries, and engaging with industry and community stakeholders to promote
alternative tuna-fishing methods that support sustainable local economic development and ensure long-term
elasmobranch conservation.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Government","department for environment, food and rural affairs","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Rob Ogden","R (D) S V S","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=8752041",NA,197083.53,"184774.53","12309.00",NA,"197083.53","DIR26S1\1162","NO","University of Edinburgh","The Darwin Initiative – Main Project Funding Stage 1","Roslin",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-04-01,2023-03-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Emily Humble, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Blue Resources Trust,Subawardee,Industry,SRI LANKA",NA,"DDI Tag only","Roslin ISPG 17/22 - N/A,DDI - Data Driven Innovation","The Roslin Institute"

increased solid waste generation that creates substantial challenges on solid waste 
management. In India, only 43 metric tons of solid waste is collected annually out of 
which 27.9% waste are treated and 72% waste are dumped in landfill. Landfill gas (LFG) 
is generated owing to the decomposition of solid waste. LFG contains greenhouse 
gases (GHGs) and methane (CH4). LFG emission to the atmosphere without proper 
treatment could increase greenhouse gas emission and has a great impact on global 
climate change. Percolation of water via landfill generates leachate which contains 
complex organic and inorganic contaminants. Leachate treatment is needed for 
protecting subsurface and surface water resources from deterioration. In analogous, the 
effect of solid waste is interconnected with the air, water pollution and spreading of 
diseases.  
The concern on solid waste alone is not enough but focusing direction on LFG and 
leachate management would alleviate pollution that sound well in developing 
sustainable environment for mankind. Among numerous technologies, membrane 
technology is one of the most energy-efficient alternatives for separating LFG and 
leachate treatment. Membrane technology has smaller footprint, low energy 
consumption and eco-friendly than the conventional treatment. The idea of this project is 
to efficiently separate LFG (CO2 and CH4) and leachate using membrane technology. 
Joint collaboration (India and UK)  would aid in transferring skills and technology that 
would promote novel solutions to the existing problem, foster safe environment and 
anticipated outcome would meets the constraints of the scientific, engineering and 
community members. Further, managing LFG and leachate using membrane technology 
would render significance to various environmental developments such as promote 
energy (CO2 and CH4 separation), sustainable resources for mankind, reduce climate

Furthermore, it plays a key role in regulating environmental services mainly through land and water use, nutrient cycles, and climate feedbacks. On current projections, however, agriculture needs to do more. Firstly, production must increase to provide enough food for a rapidly growing world population. Agriculture then needs to fulfil its potential to contribute to reducing poverty and improving the nutrition of people in low and middle-income countries. Areas of land that are suitable for spatial expansion of agriculture are extremely limited. This dictates that future advances must focus on intensifying the use of current agricultural land and other inputs. Moreover, this cannot simply be a short-term imperative but rather must be achieved in ways that can meet the needs of future generations, i.e. any intensification promoted must be sustainable intensification (SI). Currently, there is no commonly accepted way to assess whether SI pathways are indeed sustainable. In this project we will use mainly existing datasets to develop repeatable methodologies for applying the recently-developed Sustainable Intensification Indicator Framework (SIAF) to this question. The SIAF allows us to evaluate changes in production intensity driven by interventions or other factors across five sustainability domains: production, economic, human, social and environmental. The framework also has the potential to be implemented at multiple scales and the project proposed here aims to strengthen its capacity to do so in a systematic fashion. The project's activities will be based on a set of three contrasting case studies - in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Uganda - conducted with local implementing partners. Studies will test whether SIAF can be applied repeatedly across the case study production systems and agro-ecologies to generate interpretable qualitative and quantitative assessments of the sustainability side of the SI trajectories currently being promoted by the case study projects. The results of our analyses will be discussed with and evaluated by local partners to ground truth the utility of the approach. We will also compare results amongst case studies to identify common lessons on the implementation of SI. Finally, we will evaluate the SIAF approach used and conduct a critical assessment of whether systems approaches, like that employed by the SIAF, generate useful information for both local partners and more regionally-oriented policy prioritization as well as generating new scientific insights into the functioning of the contrasting production / agro-ecosystems studied. We will produce a robust, easily-applied 'Sustainable Intensification Assessment Tool' (SIAT) to assess and guide 'local' SI options in smallholder farming systems in low and middle-income countries.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Research Council","biotechnology and biological sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard","Alan Duncan","GLOBAL ACADEMY AGRICULTURE &FS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7039302",NA,1301836.44,"494491.44","207755.00","599590.00","1161387.15","BB/S014861/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","GCRF Agri systems research to enhance livelihoods in developing countries Agri-systems research to enhance livelihoods in developing countries","Roslin","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2019-04-01,2021-03-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Liz Baggs, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bangor University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|International Livestock Research Institution,Collaborator,Industry,KENYA",NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund,Roslin ISPG 17/22 - N/A","The Roslin Institute"
2018,2018-09-28,"Unsuccessful","7022958","modelling sustainable intensification pathways for brazilian livestock production (msip)","This project considers environmental and economic trade-offs inherent in the need for Brazil to sustainably produce more from agriculture while minimising environmental costs in terms of greenhouse gas emissions from production (i.e. livestock), deforestation and associated loss of ecosystem services. A wider context for this imperative is the increasing global demand for food production, the need to moderate or at least understand changing consumption patterns (esp. meat), and Brazil's ambition to maintain its pre-eminent status as a global agri commodity exporter, while maintaining domestic food security and social equality.
Sustainable agricultural intensification (SAI) is the term coined for this challenge, and widely discussed in academic and policy circles. However, it is arguably not substantiated by convincing models showing production and consumption trade-offs at different scales. This project contributes by using a mathematical modelling approach applied to depict farms and producing regions. A mathematical model also allows us to engage in the currently debated issue of reducing meat consumption; specifically using real data to illustrate the consequences of reducing consumption in a more systematic rather than partial way.
This research team has already made a significant impact to this debate in developing model outputs to describe the options for intensifying Cerrado beef production systems. This multi-disciplinary contribution has been recognised domestically in Brazil by EMBRAPA (https://goo.gl/5L5U8X) and in terms of the design of key policy incentives for low carbon agriculture - Agricultura de Baixo Carbono, (ABC), and internationally in terms of Brazil's commitments at COP21, where the country proposed a voluntary emissions reduction target of around 40% relative to baseline emissions by 2030 to be achieved by Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC).
This project aims to improve the model using evidence from experimental farms developed with UFMT and EMBRAPA in a number of ways to characterise intensification scenarios and cost-benefit trade-offs in other Brazilian ecosystems (or biomes). This includes livestock and soybean production plus mixed crop and livestock; its consequences in terms of deforestation, climate change mitigation, and implications for climate adaptation and of consumption shifts. The benefits can be characterised as direct and indirect, in that intensification can be direct in terms of measures that reduce emissions and that make the system more resilient, and indirect related to land sparing and hence the reduction of deforestation. As noted the modelling can evaluate both the supply and demand side perspectives, allowing us to analyse production ambitions, while also addressing the potential system consequences of supply or consumption management implicit in emerging dietary guidelines.
The following research questions will be addressed through further model innovation:
How much emissions mitigation is delivered through SAI applied at different scales and at what cost per tonne of emission (CO2e)?
How do SAI measures also contribute to system adaptation to climate change and what are the associated net-benefits including the synergies and trade-offs with mitigation benefits?
In which biomes might SAI yield greatest net benefits?
What are the biophysical, economic and institutional barriers to intensification at different scales of production and what does this imply for policy design?
What are the potential system consequences of reduced livestock consumption nationally? How does implicit change in consumption alter production system and therefore carbon footprint of products?
How does including other lifecycle impacts incl. those related to soybean production change the SAI calculus?

the repeated failure to build sustaining and sustainable peace in fragile and war-affected countries.
We believe this can be accomplished by significantly strengthening and deepening the Women,
Peace and Security agenda such that it addresses the transnational political-economic processes
that tend to undermine peacebuilding in postwar states. As existing theories and methodologies fail
to adequately capture the complexity of the relationship of these processes to peace, the project
draws on theoretical and methodological approaches from multiple disciplines and sectors. It is
organised around a series of international, collaborative knowledge-building workshops, spaced over
four years, which bring together academics, policymakers and practitioners. Each addresses a
particular transnational political-economic dynamic of postwar contexts, such as transportation or
energy infrastructure, extractive industries, commercial export agriculture, or public finance
management, and analyzes the ways that these impact gender relations and other structural
inequalities. The aim of each is to produce knowledge that can underpin and facilitate critical and
practical engagement with, and modification of, those processes, providing a ground-breaking

Practice theory offers a method for identifying the limits and possibilities of change and practical implications for transformative low-carbon governance. Our objectives are to :
•	using practice theory, identify points for leveraging transformative change in people’s values and practices in contrasting case studies 
•	Conduct research in dialogue with key stakeholders who can take change forward..
•	Create documentation of the research process, stakeholder dialogue and lessons from comparative analysis that will inspire scaling up similar activities elsewhere.
. Our cases involve 1) legal interventions attempting to reduce emissions, 2) life-stage transition as an opportunity of fostering consumption practices change, 3) attempted lower-carbon food production in a deprived community, 4) transformative empowerment potential of off-grid and renewable energy and 5) a site of contradictory change in meat consumption practices. These cases offer contrasting constellations of non-academic partner interests and levels of power that make success in reducing carbon emissions more or less difficult. Teams from the Netherlands, Norway, the UK and India, working in high, upper- and lower-middle income contexts, will share insights developed from these practical examples on how to transform towards more sustainable societies, and map transferable principles for wider change.

The equitable provision of secure, sustainable and affordable energy in Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia poses a global challenge that is concurrently social, technical, economic, political and ecological. UN Sustainable Development Goals seek to ensure the availability of affordable, secure and clean energy provision (SDG7) within an equitable and prosperous economy with decent work (SDG8) whilst maintaining or restoring terrestrial and coastal ecosystems from which energy fuelstock is sourced sustainably (SDG15). The scale and interlinked nature of the social, economic and environmental challenges demands a response that itself is interlinked across these countries and communities to provide capacity-building, capability training and education; collaborative research, innovation and knowledge exchange; and effective partnerships with policy and practice stakeholders to increase the sustainable provision and end-use of energy.

Living Energy is a strategic programme of capacity and capability strengthening, partnership building and research, which will catalyse a wider 10-year vision for the production of researchers with the skillsets, networks and know-how to tackle pressing development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Living Energy aims to synergise the UK's academic capability, in both training and research skills, to support 5 countries (India, Nepal, Malawi, Tanzania, Mozambique) and in-country partners to develop cohorts of skilled interdisciplinary-capable researchers able to inform, co-develop and support communities of practice to tackle goals of delivering socially and environmentally sustainable forms of clean energy. Across five partner countries Living Energy will deliver on UN Sustainable Goals 7, 8 and 15 in line with the objectives of the UK's Aid Strategy and the GCRF agenda.  

Living Energy will deliver outcomes that drive development agendas in these countries, and beyond, to enable transitions to more sustainable provision and end-use of energy. At the end of the 4 years Living Energy will have: 1) provided a programme of local and distance training in research methods to 10,000 graduate researchers equipping them to lead projects to tackle these SD challenges; 2) established an interactive team of 50 doctoral researchers across participating disciplines; 3) created study opportunities and mentorship to 75 early career researchers; 4) delivered bespoke research training to 100 career professionals and executives; 5) funded 15 ""living labs"" of research that provide opportunities for knowledge exchange, practice based research training and the development of interdisciplinary skills; 6) embedded collaborative, cross-disciplinary and practice based approaches to research training pedagogies in teaching/training curricula at 5 higher education institutions; 7) identified and demonstrated pathways to energy resilience/sustainability through peer-reviewed output; 8) increased UK and partner countries human capacity to address sustainable energy challenges; 9) established and developed numerous effective partnerships with UK and in-country practice partners, and with the policy-forming agencies in and alongside governments, their agencies and energy providers; 10) Increased the numbers of UK academics and institutions contributing to the local development challenges.

The legacy of Living Energy will include 10,000 trained graduate researchers; embedded collaborative, inter-disciplinary and practice-based approaches to research training at five higher education institutions in partner countries; and in-country partnerships enabling pathways for delivery of economically, socially and environmentally sustainable systems.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","global challenges research fund","Robin Wallace","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4016904",NA,9450399.63,"8156687.60","1293712.00",NA,"7989870.50","EP/P032605/1","YES","University of Edinburgh","GCRF: Growing Research Capability (invitation only)","ENG","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2017-04-01,2021-03-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"James Smith, School of Social and Political Science","Jamie Cross, School of Social and Political Science","Matthew Brander, Business School","Dan van der Horst, School of GeoSciences","Venki Venugopal, School of Engineering","Casey Ryan, School of GeoSciences",NA,NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund","Institute for Energy Systems"

This decade’s major challenge for the EU economy is to decouple its growth from the use of resource-input or the
environmental impact-output. The use of biomass is the main opportunity for this decoupling. For this ‘third industrial
revolution’ the industry needs a group of highly skilled staff with scientific, technological, managerial and entrepreneurial
competences for the multi-disciplinary field of biomass handling and processing The efficient and safe use of biomass
becomes a fundamental concept of this revolution, given the limited and fragmented availability of the biomass feedstock.
Often the lack of knowledge and use of innovative and specific techniques for biomass characterisation, equipment and
systems design and safety causes biomass transformation plant stoppage and thus substantial losses in terms of resources,
time and money. The innovative training network “Efficient, reliable and safe biomass handling, pretreatment and processing
for a sustainable EU bio-based economy (BIOHAPPBY)” is part of the solution. By joining forces of many sectors relevant to
biomass handling, pretreatment and processing, i.e. universities and research centers, software houses, densification
equipment suppliers, storage equipment designers, safety systems providers, plant constructors, bioenergy producers and
biorefineries, BIOHAPPBY proposes the training of highly skilled, interdisciplinary experts on an international research
programme. It will provide significant advances in the scientific understanding of the physical phenomena controlling the
biomass solids behaviour in handling systems and support groundbreaking technologies for the biomass pre-treatement,
storage, handling and safety. Industry- close development and market uptake on those technologies will ensure reliable,
economical, efficient, sustainable and safe handling and feeding processes for biomass valorisation plants.","CSE","School of Engineering","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - marie sk_odowska-curie actions","Stefanos Papanicolopulos","INST OF INFRASTRUCTURE & ENVIR","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4067270",NA,455479.8,"419479.80","36000.00",NA,"455479.80","765311","NO","University of Edinburgh","MSCA-ITN-2017 MSCA-ITN-ETN","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-01-01,2021-12-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Jin Ooi, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

Turkana County in North West Kenya where most of the water available for human consumption or agricultural use is
extracted from boreholes. All too often, this water is harmful due to its salinity content, and the need for desalination is
acute but largely unmet.
We propose using the locally abundant sunshine and wind for powering desalination. However, local communities or
businesses will only adopt desalinating systems that are cheap enough to procure, build, operate and maintain using local
materials, skills and supply chains. One such 'appropriate' technology here would be reflective parabolic troughs that focus
solar light onto pipes where the water is circulated. The resulting water vapour is then condensed to fresh water. The
remaining saline water also gets sterilised, and may be kept for other uses like washing.
The main objectives are described as follows:
1. Investigate appropriate business models and the development of local ownership and stewardship of desalination units.
This includes: documenting the availability of relevant technical skills and suppliers in Turkana and Kenya, and the local
market for water purification; checking compliance with regulations; and studying the wider social environment and
governance of water resources, esp. gender, age, and the co- existence of multiple communities including pastoralists,
farmers and refugees, so that we help ensure fair access, avoid conflict and facilitate adoption of the technology.
2. Develop appropriate designs and construction for desalinating devices, including prototypes and prototype testing. In
particular: A parabolic trough as previously described; and a device that captures moisture from the air. The systems will be
built and deployed in the field, and their performance monitored to enhance design and operation. Trials on the ground will
also address issues of scale formation and bacteriological quality of water. Specifications and preliminary designs will be
produced to supply markets and stakeholders identified in WP1, and local partners encouraged to promote prototype
deployment.
3. Investigate the use of the water for irrigation and re-afforestation. Trees are a critical market for water use. They can
transform the local economy and even the local climate, and people rely on them for shade, fruit and timber. We will
investigate the best use of both the desalinated water and the resultant brine by-product for agricultural, horticultural and
pastoralist activities. Some tree species that are both tolerant to salinity and of economic interest (esp. fruit trees) will be
planted in selected areas, with due consideration given to the drainage of water from these areas to avoid contamination of
freshwater bodies.
4. A virtual ""Joint Institute for Research and Training in Water and Energy Access"" to continue and amplify this project
beyond the grant period. Drawing on the advice of local stakeholders (community groups, NGOs and officials), and the
combined expertise of its members (namely: the University of Edinburgh, the Kenya Forestry Research Institute, the
University of Strathmore based in Nairobi, the University of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Science and Technology, and The
East-African branch of UK-based NGO Practical Action), the Institute will devise research programmes as well as training
programmes for local communities, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, engineers, scientists and policymakers.
5. Demonstrating prototypes to local stakeholders. This will encourage communities, entrepreneurs and officials to adopt
and deploy the technology. For this purpose, we will also produce a clear manual and Youtube videos, and the
demonstration of prototypes, both in operation and also in construction, with involvement of local artisans and of
communities seeking to remedy the quality of their borehole water.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","global challenges research fund","Dimitri Mignard","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3897311",NA,1213155.72,"998223.72","214932.00",NA,"1007676.58","EP/P029787/1","YES","University of Edinburgh","Tackling global development challenges through engineering and digital technology research","ENG","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2017-05-01,2020-04-30,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Dan van der Horst, School of GeoSciences","Kate Heal, School of GeoSciences","Giulio Santori, School of Engineering","Jean-Benoit Falisse, School of Social and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund","Institute for Energy Systems"

Coastal erosion is driven by relative sea level rise, tides, cyclones, and
extreme waves all of which are affected by climate change and variability.
Sea level rise, more intense cyclones, waves, and surges all pose serious threats to the vast number of people who live
along the coastal areas of India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. These three developing countries experience severe coastal
erosion problems which result in damage to coastal structures, roads, dwellings, infrastructure, tourist facilities, historic
sites, fisheries, etc. For example, 3,829 km of India's 8,414-km long coastline is eroding. Bangladesh is experiencing beach
erosion that exceeds 100 m/yr at certain sites. Sri Lanka is losing 175,000 - 285,000 m2 per year of coastal land to the sea.
The foregoing examples illustrate the scale of coastal erosion in the Indian Subcontinent.
This proposal aims to assess coastal erosion and its mitigation in the context of the Indian Subcontinent. To achieve this,
CoastEr will establish a collaborative partnership between engineers and scientists from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and
the UK. Using climate change scenarios, we propose to investigate present and future coastal erosion problems and
suggest sustainable engineering mitigation measures. This will involve making informed assessment of the effect of future
climate change/variability scenarios on sea level rise, cyclones, storm surges and extreme waves. Results from advanced
numerical modelling tools and scaled ocean laboratory facilities will then be used to study the effects of climate drivers on
coastal hydrodynamics, sediment transport, morphodynamics, deposition and erosion, and the coastal ecosystem. The
project will produce coastal erosion zonation maps according to present and future climate scenarios; these maps will be
useful to decision makers responsible for coastal management in India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. We will explore the
vulnerability to climate change of protected estuaries and coastal ecosystems such as the Sundarbans. From shoreline
change observations along the coast of the Indian Subcontinent, the overseas researchers will help create a GIS database
of significant scientific value that would be useful for coastal management activities and marine spatial planning. This
dataset will be made freely available, enabling further advances to take place in coastal erosion research. Mitigation
approaches will be recommended for particularly vulnerable sites, based on physical and numerical model studies of
different hard and soft engineering measures. In the ODA context, the proposal is directed towards sustainable
infrastructure development and engineering for disaster resilience through the use of digital data.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","global challenges research fund","Venki Venugopal","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3884513",NA,1998077.17,"1746313.17","251764.00",NA,"1653481.74","EP/P02937X/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Tackling global development challenges through engineering and digital technology research","ENG","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2017-05-01,2020-04-30,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Tom Bruce, School of Engineering","Alistair Borthwick, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund","Institute for Energy Systems"

2016,2016-10-05,"Successful","3756779","tidal energy for sustainable village electricity supply in the indian sundarbans biosphere","Specific Objectives are:
1. Conduct detailed river depth measurements (bathymetry) of potential energy sites in Sundarbans;
2. Using the measured bathymetry in numerical models, predict and quantify the tidal power resources at high energy sites;
3. Develop numerical models representing the energy extraction process of tidal turbines at candidate sites;
4. From above, quantify electricity generated from tidal machines, and, conduct an electrical load analysis and a cost benefit analysis;
5. Simulate the environmental consequences of tidal energy extraction by tidal devices; and
6. Engage researchers from both UK and India with this research and provide them with necessary engineering training/skills in Marine Science.

This proposal between the UK and Indian academics and scientists aims to establish a collaborative partnership through UKIERI in exploring marine energy resources in Indian Sundarbans Delta. This proposal aims to identify potential tidal energy sites in the Sundarbans delta, quantify the amount of off-grid electricity production from these sites, match the generation capacity to the local demand and, assess any environmental impact the energy extraction may have on the river network.
Sundarbans, a world heritage site in India, is world’s largest inter-tidal delta region containing huge areas of mangrove forests. The site is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The eco-geography of this area is totally dependent on the tidal flow within this region. Tidal currents in this region have the potential to produce electric power as one of the renewable energy resources, and when this happens, many thousands of households distributed across 131 villages in 20 islands, who have no national network based access to electricity at present will be benefited. Although, India as one of the emerging economics on the globe, has great potential of ocean based renewable energies, the current energy tapping from marine energy sources appears to be nil. There is an urgent need to address this, and the collaboration between UK and Indian academics and researchers, identified in this proposal, will assist India in achieving some of its renewable energy targets.
Another purpose of this partnership is to engage early carrier researchers in renewable energy and marine science research and create an opportunity for experienced researchers to work with them in partnership and train them through knowledge transfer activities such as numerical modelling, site measurement activities involving river bathymetry and tidal current measurements, data processing and analysis, report writing skills, participation in seminars and workshops, capacity building and stakeholder engagements.","CSE","School of Engineering","Overseas - Other","uk-india education and research initiative","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Venki Venugopal","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3756779","R83658",105475,"105475.00","0.00",NA,"105475.00","DST-051 IND/CONT/G/16-17/76","NO","University of Edinburgh","Guidelines for DST – UKIERI Call for Research Proposals","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-04-01,2021-03-31,"Janet Ball",NA,"David Ingram, School of Engineering","Robin Wallace, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cardiff University,Partner,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-","Institute for Energy Systems"

2016,2016-09-28,"Successful","3370967","diagnostic innovation and livestock (dial): towards more effective and sustainable applications of antibiotics in livestock farming","The widespread use of antibiotics in livestock farming, in many circumstances, serves as alternative to the diagnosis, targeted treatment and prevention of disease in individual animals, flocks and herds. Relationships and practices between diagnosis, prescription, treatment and prevention have become stretched to the point of rupture, a rupture thrown into sharp focus by the AMR issue. Better, smarter, more rapid and more accessible diagnoses, driven by a shift in the behaviours and conditions associated with diagnostic decision-making (whether performed in the laboratory or at the point-of-care by veterinarians or farmers) represents a critical step to delivering more effective and sensible use of antibiotic medicines in animal health (Kessel, 2014; Schroeder, 2016). Improvements in diagnostic development and practice, however, and in their relationship to prescription and treatment, requires social, governance and technical innovations, understanding the parameters and conditions of which demands urgent research. 
This project addresses the range of behaviours associated with diagnoses in animal health as socio-technical and knowledge practices requiring regulatory interventions (devising and standardizing processes), practical applications (diagnostic tool development and diagnostic practice), awareness and behavioral change (in responsive and ‘response-able’ practices, including decisions to diagnose or not-to-diagnose), innovation (from the development and trialing of new diagnostic tools to new ways of doing diagnostics and their relationship to other interventions) and effective and sensible translations (through treatment decision-making, prescription, medicine use and preventative intervention). Empirically, this original and far-reaching project will bring improved understanding of current knowledges, practices and behaviours (and their interdependence) to the field of veterinary diagnostics and, critically, to the relationship of these diagnostics to disease treatment and prevention. It will identify drivers for behavior change (in the widest sense) in these domains, and will provide an experimentally based trialing and assessment of the flexibilities, capacities and conditions for (and barriers to) improvement and innovation in diagnostics and diagnostic practice. From the lessons learnt, the project will contribute to the strategic progress towards better use of antibiotics in livestock farming. 
This is a four-year multidisciplinary collaboration involving geographers, veterinary scientists and STS scholars. It builds directly on the sub-themes of the ESRC call in focusing on: the awareness and engagement of key actors in antibiotic use through diagnostic practice and development within livestock farming; in addressing formal and informal market access with respect to both antibiotics and diagnostic tools/technologies and the standardization, or otherwise, of relevant processes and practices; in developing an interdisciplinary approach to stewardship that builds on previous work by the research team on understanding the responsibilities, practices and drivers of stakeholders (Bruce, 2010; Buller et al., 2014; Tait and Banda, 2016; Hinchliffe et al., 2016; Reyher 2016a, 2016b); and, finally, in driving innovative, regulation behavior and practice, with respect to the regulation and governance of diagnostic development, to the business strategies of both developers and veterinary practices and to innovative and experimental interventions in diagnostic and clinical practice which directly impact on-farm sustainable animal health and welfare. The interdisciplinary research team will work with and draw original empirically driven information, understanding and analysis from diagnostic tool developers and regulators, veterinary practices and professional bodies, farmers and treatment, decision-makers, veterinary laboratories, the food industry and government regulatory authorities to develop durable and innovative strategies for facilitating and advancing smarter approaches to the use of antibiotics in agriculture.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","UK - Research Council","economic and social research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grants","Ann Bruce","SCHOOL OF SOCIAL & P S CENTRES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3370967","RA4119",540015.3,"342942.20","197073.10",NA,"432012.24","ES/P008194/1","NO","University of Exeter","Tackling antimicrobial resistance: behaviour within and beyond the healthcare setting","SPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-07-01,2022-06-30,"Leon Page",NA,"Joyce Tait, School of Social and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Bristol,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Exeter,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)","Unclassified"

Urban Refugee Youth in Beirut
Today, more than 65 million people are forcibly displaced, with developing regions hosting more than 86% of refugees
under UNHCR's mandate. Those younger than 18 comprise more than 50% of refugees worldwide, and in Lebanon, they
comprise 53% of its refugee population. Importantly, around 50% of Lebanon's displaced youth are in cities, not in formal camps - challenging humanitarian agencies' ability to integrate refugees with Lebanon's own vulnerable or at-risk urban youth. But since refugee youth living outside of regulated camps are now perhaps the most vulnerable and fastest growing group in forced displacement, the need to create urban spaces that allow for their dignity, safety and rights, as well as access to services, educations and futures in long-term displacement, remains one of aid organizations' most urgent and long-term challenges. Our proposed research directly addresses this need, and thereby contributes to one of the most pressing 21st century issues at the heart of both displacement and development policies.
Refugees - including displaced youth - often highlight that life in displacement is a social process involving the collective rebuilding of physical, social and moral worlds. It is important to acknowledge the suffering and loss involved in being a refugee. But it is equally vital to recognise the potentials that lie in these young people's deep, internal resources, and their abilities to rebuild their lives. This research seeks to understand these emotional resources and rebuilding processes, trying to grasp (1) displaced youths' everyday, emotional lives; (2) how their social connections and mutual interdependencies sustain them in long-term displacement; (3) and how these understandings can be used to help to make refugee and
development policies more responsive and sustainable.
Our research proposes an innovative combination of ethnography, interviews and creative workshops to help us explore these topics. We draw on studies of emotions to design creative arts- and skills based workshops and platforms. These have two aims: they are designed to help us explore young refugees emotional lives and experiences, but they are also intended to provide practical, technical educational and employment skills for young participants, and useful policy platforms to strengthen the capacity of our partner refugee and development organizations in Lebanon.
We propose visual art/mural-making, music and photography/film workshops because there is mounting evidence of the effectiveness of participatory visual and creative, arts-based methods in understanding the everyday lives of young people.
Our workshops are delivered in informal educational settings to include both refugee and at-risk Lebanese youth. Held across 3 phases at 4-month intervals, they follow the same group of 40 youth aged 11 to 16. In Phase 1, the participants create individual-skill based work expressing dimensions of their everyday lives; Phase 2 adds group work to explore their experiences of 'home' and 'friendships'; while Phase 3 includes all workshop participants to produce a collaborative, public facing joint exhibition of their art to be shared with the wider Lebanese community.
In bringing displaced and Lebanese youth communities together through creative platforms, the research findings will contribute to a better understanding of forcibly displaced youths' everyday  connections and relationships, whilst also communicating the need to make visible the many intimacies that sustain these young people's everyday emotional and social worlds. We hope to thereby assist refugee and development organizations - and so the country's long-term development - by contributing to sustainable solutions for youth in protracted displacement.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","UK - Research Council","economic and social research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grants","Liliana Riga","SOCIAL & POLITICAL STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3273834",NA,299407.56,"194838.16","104569.40",NA,"239526.05",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","GCRF ESRC/AHRC Forced Displacement call","SPS","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2016-10-01,2018-03-31,"Joanna Wielgo",NA,"Mary Holmes, School of Social and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund","Unclassified"

2.1. Fostering renewable energies and energy efficiency
Technology transfer and university-enterprise cooperation, Renewable energy: marine

Wave energy is called upon to play a role in the European energy mix but
significant obstacles still exist. SIWEIS will foster wave energy growth through
integration with other maritime uses (transport, energy, aquaculture). Using
Blue Economy priority sectors, 5 main obstacles will be addressed: reliability;
survivability; sustainability; LCOE and environmental integration. The main
outputs will be a GIS tool and an integrated strategy to leverage wave energy
under a transnational approach.

The aim of this project is to achieve sustainable integration of wave energy
into the AA economy by means of innovative synergies with other maritime
activities (transport, energy, aquaculture & support services). Wave
energy is one of the most promising marine renewable resources and one
of the Blue Growth Priorities. Almost 45% of wave energy developers are
European and a new, homegrown industrial sector is emerging. However, the
wave energy sector is at a crucial stage where cost and risk reduction are
needed in order to attract investors. The overarching objective of SIWEIS is
to develop an integrated AA strategy to accelerate wave energy development
from basic research to demonstration projects, through the integration of wave
energy converters with existing and mature maritime economic activities.
Three specific objectives will be addressed: (1) identify synergies between
wave energy and other maritime activities and classify the AA potential
for a multiuse maritime space approach; (2) cluster wave energy resource
availability, focusing on met-ocean conditions, socio-economic benefits and
synergies with other uses; (3) identify the most relevant technological needs
for wave energy developers in the AA in order to maximize the rate of success
and minimize risks/costs of demonstration projects. The results obtained
from SIWEIS will impact on the current situation by characterizing the socioeconomic
impact of wave energy development and integration in the AA.","CSE","School of Engineering","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","interreg iv","Henry Jeffrey","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3028360",NA,160714.28,"142546.43","18167.86",NA,"120535.71","EAPA_374/2016","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-06-01,2020-05-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Adrian De Andres, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Institute for Energy Systems"

2021,2021-10-26,"Successful","11682308","environmental sustainability and economic cooperation in the longue duree: a comparative approach to locality, history and development","In recent years there have been multiple challenges to the existing understandings of economic growth and the environment, and the difficulties in balancing economic, social, and environmental goals. There is growing awareness of the challenges posed by climate change and the depletion of natural resources, and the urgency of developing balanced approaches for future economic growth and environmental sustainability. At the same time, the uneven economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the lingering repercussions of the 2008 financial crisis continue to raise important questions regarding social and economic equality, how to manage access to financial resources, and how to protect the agency and opportunity of individuals within a globalized economic system dominated by large multinational corporations. This network seeks to explore and bridge these two issues of our times - sustainable development and economic inequality. In particular, we seek to explore diverse models of economic cooperation and sustainable resource management through comparative and interdisciplinary engagement with historians, anthropologists, political scientists, geographers, and sociologists, with the goal of developing future research agenda into sustainable growth that can incorporate a diverse range of economic, environmental, and social objectives.

Contemporary environmental and economic crises highlight the importance of incorporating a humanistic approach to growth and development that brings to the fore sustainable and equitable patterns of resource management. As such, this network brings together humanities and social science researchers in order to explore the historical and cultural contexts surrounding diverse models of economic cooperation and resource management. In this way, we seek to provoke new understandings of sustainable development, both past and present, while also fostering new collaborations across disciplines and regions in order to highlight the significance of the social and cultural context of sustainable growth. In particular, we seek to prompt new insights and comparative studies into sustainable growth through the example of the Korean kye - a type of organization that has been used to manage a wide range of resources throughout Korean history including forests, fishery rights, education, and financial resources, to name just a few. By bringing examples of Korean kye organizations over time into dialogue with comparative models of economic cooperation and sustainable development from other regions, we aim to generate new directions for future research into alternative models of growth and economic
activity.

Overall, this project will search for links between historically specific examples and contemporary case studies in order to develop a deeper understanding of the interrelations between environmentally sustainable growth and social and economic equality. We will create an environment for interdisciplinary conversations where researchers can learn from one another, while using discussions of kye as a vehicle to expand the understanding of sustainable development and create a foundation for future collaborative research. Throughout this process, we will foster strong ties between researchers in both South Korea and the United Kingdom by hosting a programme of visiting research fellowships and international workshops and conferences that will not only provide a valuable contribution to academic knowledge but also support researchers - especially early career researchers - to develop future research and international collaborations.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","economic and social research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grants","Holly Stephens","ASIAN STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=11682308","R47434",49233,"49233.00","0.00",NA,"49233.00","ES/W011301/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","UK South Korea Connections Grants 2021","LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2022-02-01,2023-07-31,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Durham University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Ewha Womans University,Collaborator,HEI,KOREA, REPUBLIC OF",NA,NA,"-",NA

2019,2019-09-27,"Unsuccessful","9158587","genomic selection to improve the efficiency and sustainability of tilapia aquaculture in south east asia","The vast majority of global aquaculture takes place in developing countries, where it helps address several UN Sustainable Development Goals, either directly through human consumption, or indirectly through economic growth. Innovation in aquaculture production has major potential to raise incomes of small-scale producers, and to add resilience to food systems supporting livelihoods in vulnerable regions. However, intensification of aquaculture poses environmental concerns, and increasing the efficiency of fish production systems is essential to meet this global demand in a sustainable manner.

Nile tilapia is arguably the world's most important food fish, and is one of the cheapest and most accessible source of animal protein, providing vital micro and macro nutrients for cognitive and physical development. However, substantial barriers to increasing tilapia aquaculture include variable production efficiency across diverse farming systems. Feed is the biggest cost in intensive fish farming systems, and reducing feed consumption for a given productivity level is therefore a key goal. Improved feed efficiency reduces the use of natural resources, including fish oil and fish meal, thus contributing to the preservation of marine ecosystems. Improved feed efficiency also reduces nutrient outputs which can be detrimental to the environment, and reduces energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with feed production.

Genetic improvement of feed efficiency in tilapia has major potential but is hampered by the operational challenge of high-throughput methods for recording feed efficiency, as well as lack of tools and optimised strategies to incorporate feed conversion traits into the breeding program goals. In this proposal, research outputs from previous BBSRC-funded projects relating to genomic selection and development of a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array for tilapia will be translated to achieve genetic improvement of feed efficiency, with Vietnam as an exemplar country.

The project was co-developed by scientists at The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh (UK), WorldFish, and The National Breeding Centre for Southern Freshwater Aquaculture (Vietnam). Together the team will perform a large scale feed efficiency trial at the breeding centre in Vietnam, where individual records will be matched to genotypes using the SNP array, genetic parameters will be estimated, and optimised methods for performing genomic selection will be tested. The results will be applied to select parent fish with high breeding values for feed conversion, and the performance of their progeny will be benchmarked against families with lower breeding values.

The tilapia strain with improved feed efficiency will be disseminated via the existing system of multiplication hatcheries and smallholder farmers in Vietnam. A workshop and promotional material will be developed to communicate the benchmarking trial results, and to encourage regular uptake of genetically improved stock by these stakeholders. The outputs will include economic and social benefits for the project partner and smallholder farmers in Vietnam, via reduced feed costs and more efficient production systems. The impacts extend to human health via provision of cheap and sustainable sources of animal protein and nutrients, and to the environment via reduced used of marine sourced feed ingredients and higher production output per unit of pond space.

While Vietnam is the exemplar country (4th largest aquaculture producer globally), the techniques developed will be applied in several other Asian countries where WorldFish supply genetically improved tilapia (Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Timor-Leste, Bangladesh, India). Therefore, the project has major potential to address the challenge of improving productivity and incomes of small scale producers with reduced environmental impact, and improving access to sustainable sources of animal protein.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Research Council","biotechnology and biological sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard","Ross Houston","ROSLIN INSTITUTE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9158587",NA,292702.79,"235219.79","57483.00",NA,"249103.67","BB/T012498/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","GCRF Translation Awards Joint BBSRC-NERC GCRF Research Translation Call Sustainable Enhancement of Agriculture and Aquaculture Production","Roslin","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2020-04-01,2022-01-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WorldFish Center,Subawardee,Charity,MALAYSIA|National Breeding Centre for Freshwater Aquaculture,Partner,Government,VIET NAM",NA,"DDI Tag only","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund,Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 3,DDI - Data Driven Innovation","The Roslin Institute"

Africa has some of the world's most glaring education inequalities; children who are born poor, female, or in rural or conflict-affected regions, face extreme disadvantage in education. PEAKS takes a multidisciplinary and multistakeholder approach to using indigenous knowledge, held in memory institutions like national libraries and national
archives in Africa, to promote education, develop cultural identity, bridge gender gaps, influence behavioural changes and promote sustainable livelihoods of African people, especially those who are marginalised and/or affected by crises and disaster.

In phase 1, PEAKS focuses on 4 African countries - Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and Nigeria -- where education of a large number of children is often affected by a variety of factors such as poverty, natural disasters and conflicts. Subsequently, with advice from the African Union and other African partners, other countries will be added to ensure that the cultural and historic contexts, challenges, needs and capacity of all the regions in Africa are addressed. The project
takes a bottom-up approach to engage with a range of stakeholders at the supply side of indigenous information like national libraries and national archives in Africa, and at the demand side of information especially school teachers, schoolchildren and young adults, as well as other stakeholders like government departments, international organisations, NGOs and businesses, to co-develop a research agenda and build equitable partnership for developing sustainable solutions.

In phase 1, PEAKS will develop case studies using indigenous content and learning contexts in the partner countries where a large number of school age children are affected or marginalised due to protracted crisis and conflicts. Through the case studies and engagement with the wider audience in several African countries, PEAKS will co-develop a research agenda and through subsequent commissioned projects in phase 2, build capacity in content development for education using African indigenous and government information, and develop skills training of information professionals, teachers,
schoolchildren and other stakeholders for classroom teaching and lifelong learning.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","arts and humanities research council","UNITED KINGDOM","ahrc outline","Melissa Terras","ARTS HUMANITIES SOCIAL SCIENCE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=8260826",NA,135791.4,"84695.40","51096.00",NA,"108633.12",NA,"NO","University of Northumbria","Network Plus","LLC","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2020-04-01,2024-03-31,"Boleslaw Czarnecki",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Northumbria,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA

The Cool Farm Tool is owned by the Cool Farm Alliance (CFA) who will partner on this project. It is a business-led initiative to assess and improve the sustainability of agriculture-based supply chains. It is funded via a membership model, with membership consisting of over 50 companies including for example major multinationals such as Unilever, PepsiCo, Heineken, Danone, Nestle, Marks and Spencer, and Tesco. Members pay to maintain the tool and deploy at scale in their supply chains but it is a core principle of the Alliance that the tool is and will always be free-to-use for farmers.
The CFT itself is a science-based decision support tool designed for use by farmers at farm scale. It has benefitted from significant NERC Discovery and Innovation funding in the past and as a result includes a growing suite of metrics for crop and livestock systems in an expanding set of geographic locations (over 100 countries). Several case studies have shown the impact that has been derived using the tool, for example PepsiCo's ""50-in-5"" (http://pepsico.co.uk/live/story/celebrating-sustainable-farming) and egg production in North America resulting in a 25% reduction in the carbon footprint from primary production (Vetter et al 2018).
Tropical perennial crops are of huge importance to global food supply chains and typically have high dependence on smallholder farmers in DAC countries where decision-support has been hindered less scientific evidence and the focus of researchers in temperate regions. This project build on numerous previous NERC and Wellcome Trust outputs and exploits established successful relationships between the project partners to ensure delivery. We will develop modules based around the existing CFT methods to allow a one-stop shop assessment tool for carbon and water footprinting and biodiversity impacts of farm practice in tropical perennials. Through partnership with the Cool Farm Alliance and the £5.4M Wellcome Trust funded SHEFS project we will ensure delivery of a tool which has practical value to farmers and supply chains. This business-led, science-based, and farmer-focused project will thereby provide robust metrics which will allow farmers to engage and demonstrate their positive actions for sustainability into international supply chains, and the businesses to identify good practices to embed in their sustainable sourcing strategies. The possibility to combine, in a single decision support tool, the multiple impacts of farm practices is attractive for many reasons, not least being that it will reduce the current burden on farmers to conduct multiple assessments of dubious value on multiple impacts for multiple buyers.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Research Council","natural environment research council","UNITED KINGDOM","innovation","Jonathan Hillier","GLOBAL ACADEMY AGRICULTURE &FS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7092104","RA4895",154995,"105280.00","49715.00",NA,"123996.00","NE/S013962/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Innovation Projects 2018","Roslin","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2019-10-24,2022-03-31,"Gillian Mutanga",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Cambridge,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,Collaborator,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund,Roslin ISPG 17/22 - N/A,DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)","The Roslin Institute"

Furthermore, it plays a key role in regulating environmental services mainly through land and water use, nutrient cycles, and climate feedbacks. On current projections, however, agriculture needs to do more. Firstly, production must increase to provide enough food for a rapidly growing world population. Agriculture then needs to fulfil its potential to contribute to reducing poverty and improving the nutrition of people in low and middle-income countries. Areas of land that are suitable for spatial expansion of agriculture are extremely limited. This dictates that future advances must focus on intensifying the use of current agricultural land and other inputs. Moreover, this cannot simply be a short-term imperative but rather must be achieved in ways that can meet the needs of future generations, i.e. any intensification promoted must be sustainable intensification (SI). Currently, there is no commonly accepted way to assess whether SI pathways are indeed sustainable. In this project we will use mainly existing datasets to develop repeatable methodologies for applying the recently-developed Sustainable Intensification Indicator Framework (SIAF) to this question. The SIAF allows us to evaluate changes in production intensity driven by interventions or other factors across five sustainability domains: production, economic, human, social and environmental. The framework also has the potential to be implemented at multiple scales and the project proposed here aims to strengthen its capacity to do so in a systematic fashion. The project's activities will be based on a set of three contrasting case studies - in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Uganda - conducted with local implementing partners. Studies will test whether SIAF can be applied repeatedly across the case study production systems and agro-ecologies to generate interpretable qualitative and quantitative assessments of the sustainability side of the SI trajectories currently being promoted by the case study projects. The results of our analyses will be discussed with and evaluated by local partners to ground truth the utility of the approach. We will also compare results amongst case studies to identify common lessons on the implementation of SI. Finally, we will evaluate the SIAF approach used and conduct a critical assessment of whether systems approaches, like that employed by the SIAF, generate useful information for both local partners and more regionally-oriented policy prioritization as well as generating new scientific insights into the functioning of the contrasting production / agro-ecosystems studied. We will produce a robust, easily-applied 'Sustainable Intensification Assessment Tool' (SIAT) to assess and guide 'local' SI options in smallholder farming systems in low and middle-income countries.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Research Council","biotechnology and biological sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard","Alan Duncan","GLOBAL ACADEMY AGRICULTURE &FS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7039302",NA,1301836.44,"494491.44","207755.00","599590.00","1161387.15","BB/S014861/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","GCRF Agri systems research to enhance livelihoods in developing countries Agri-systems research to enhance livelihoods in developing countries","Roslin","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2019-04-01,2021-03-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Liz Baggs, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bangor University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|International Livestock Research Institution,Collaborator,Industry,KENYA",NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund,Roslin ISPG 17/22 - N/A","The Roslin Institute"

Building on our experience and expert understanding, Phase 3 (Expand) will focus on the creation of sustainable and self-supporting communities of practice to empower cultural change that enables better practice to be widely adopted to: foster a culture of sharing expertise and enabling; integrate project consultancy, training and awareness raising to effect and support change; move from local and individual actions to national and community level effects. Our goal is that the UK research community be enabled to take full advantage of software and, in doing so, to support the conduct of excellent research.


Our objectives are:

A) Widespread adoption of research best practice: agreeing and defining best practice with reference to research software, and enabling its widespread adoption to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of modern research. Enabling development of models and blueprints for initiating, nurturing and maturing communities of practice, enhancing our status in the UK and internationally as the go-to institution for insight into research software matters and catalysing new international collaborations.

B) Cutting-edge policy and guidance: collaborating with stakeholders to create and disseminate evidence-based guidance, infrastructure, policies and tools. This leads to improved reusability of research software and its associated research outputs.

C) A capable research community: based on a sustainable and scalable community-led model that will push the boundaries of knowledge across domains to maintain excellence and drive innovation and career paths, to increase the recognition of research software. Supporting collaboration in the UK research society and helping it become more resilient and sustainable will achieve an increased social and cultural impact.

D) An open evidence bank: identifying and generating datasets, conducting analysis to provide insight and evidence of the importance of software, people and practices. This enables costing of resources required to develop, maintain and preserve research software.


To achieve these goals, we will be:

1) Raising awareness: empower and develop a cohort of ambassadors for good practice through our Fellowship; outreach to stakeholders at all levels on research software issues; to deliver adoption of best practice.

2) Seeding change: build multiple sustainable Communities of Practice (CoP): for research domains, for techniques, for stakeholder groups, for UK institutions; set up expert panels that commission topic-based programmes of workshops, policy studies and outreach; nurture and scale existing CoPs e.g. through RSE exchanges; develop tools and services to support CoPs; to guarantee the widespread adoption of research best practice.

3) Providing expertise: create regional training hubs to continue growth of provision; commission new courses; refocus open call consultancy; conduct feasibility study for an RSE brokerage; to form a capable research community.

4) Influencing policy: publish new guidance and standards; work with international collaborators to put policy into practice; conduct research that improves understanding of research software; to deliver cutting-edge policy and guidance and build an open evidence bank.","CSE","EPCC","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard","Neil Chue Hong","EDIN PARALLEL COMPUTING CENTRE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6581971","RA4728",8103191.51,"7387851.51","715340.00",NA,"6482553.21","EP/S021779/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Open - Responsive Mode","EPCC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-12-01,2023-11-30,"Jennifer Loukes",NA,"Mark Parsons, EPCC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Manchester,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Oxford,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Southampton,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of California, San Diego,Partner,HEI,UNITED STATES|University of California, Berkeley,Partner,HEI,UNITED STATES|The Alan Turing Institute,Partner,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Francis Crick Institute, The,Partner,Government,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Cambridge,Partner,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Leicester,Partner,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Science and Technologies Facilities Council, The,Partner,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM|Microsoft Research Limited,Partner,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","Award Indicative Successful,DDI Hub - Bayes Centre","Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre"

third more populous. This increase in the global population will put extraordinary pressure on agricultural systems. A
concurrent boost in agricultural production will be required to meet already overburdened food, fiber and fuel demands.
However, up to 35% of crop production is lost due to pathogen and herbivorous insect attack. Thus, the development of
new strategies to improve durable plant resistance is of great economic and social importance.
Currently, crop protection practices are mainly based on toxins and pesticides. These chemicals often offer limited efficacy
and are potentially hazardous to human health and the environment, while still leading to economic losses of billions every
year. Conversely, genetic and biochemical improvement of plant immunity represents a safe and sustainable alternative to
equip plants with defences against disease.
Effective plant immune responses rely on recognition of the attacker's strategy. Plants discriminates between attack by
biotrophs (i.e. pathogens that feed on living host cells), necrotrophs (i.e. pathogens that kill the host cell before feeding)
and herbivorous insects by triggering specific hormonal signalling networks that tailor the defence response according to
the attacker encountered. Key players in these networks are the hormones salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and
ethylene (ET). Whereas SA is central to defence responses against biotrophs, JA/ET are generally involved in responses to
necrotrophs and insects. Interestingly, an antagonistic effect between SA and JA has been described frequently. This
hormonal trade off in immunity enables plants to prioritize defences against the attackers encountered, but in current
chemical and genetic crop protection strategies, stimulation of defence against one type of attacker often leads to severe
susceptibility to attackers of another type.
SA- and JA/ET-mediated defence responses involve accumulation of the free radical nitric oxide (NO), which has been
implicated in the control of protein activity, localization and conformation through the formation of S-nitrosothiols (protein-
SNO). Plants genetically manipulated to overproduce NO (nox1 mutants) or unable to degrade the main intracellular NO
bioreservoir, S-nitrosoglutathione (gsnor1 mutants), display increased levels of protein-SNO and severe susceptibility
towards pathogen infection. Recently, exciting findings demonstrated for the first time how specificity in protein-SNO
signalling is achieved in plants. The oxidoreductase enzyme, TRX-h5, the gene family of which comprises dozens of
members in plants, was shown to display denitrosylase activity towards protein-SNO. Importantly, overexpression of TRXh5
was shown to rescue disease resistance in nox1 mutants, but not in gsnor1 mutants. Altogether, these latest findings
suggest that like TRX-h5, other members of the TRX family may also control specific subsets of protein-SNO that regulate
particular metabolic redox networks. This proposal, to be completed at the Institute for Molecular Plants Science in the
University of Edinburgh, employs state-of-the-art genetic, genomic and analytical techniques to study the role of TRX
members in providing specificity to protein-SNO signalling during cross-talk between SA and JA/ET-mediated plant immune
responses. By increasing our understanding of TRX-based resistance trade-offs, we may ultimately be able to genetically
uncouple these antagonistic immune pathways to provide plants with resistance against a broad-spectrum of different
attackers.","CSE","School of Biological Sciences","UK - Research Council","biotechnology and biological sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","fellowship","Lucas Frungillo","INST OF MOLECULAR PLANT SCIENC","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6690935","RA4645",373561,"249154.00","124407.00",NA,"298848.80","BB/S010262/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Discovery Fellowships - 9th May 2018 Committee B","BIO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-05-01,2022-08-31,"Veronica Brivio",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

Our rationale in this proposal is that fully understanding and making constructive use of the latent potential embodied in the idea of adaptive re-use for placemaking, job creation and economic growth demands a novel approach; in
our case, a targeted, iterative design strategy, engaging a critical mass of multi-stakeholder participants into a comprehensive and extended innovating process centered on the four pillars of preservation, financing, business models and integrated governance. We carry out case studies in Edinburgh, Zagreb and three adaptive re-use intervention locations in Portugal, to build a knowledge base and decision support capability to enable creation of successful adaptive re-use blueprints with high replicability and up-scaling potential.","CAHSS","Edinburgh College of Art","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials","Dave O'Brien","EDINBURGH COLLEGE OF ART","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4506229",NA,293076.93,"234461.54","58615.39",NA,"293076.93",NA,"NO","Research Management AS","H2020-SC5-2016-2017","ECA",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-01-01,2021-12-31,"Anna Votsi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Research Management AS,Lead,Industry,NORWAY",NA,NA,"-",NA
2016,2017-02-15,"Unsuccessful","2910444","wythenshawe researching local food for increasing sustainability and health","Rationale and context: Local food is widely seen as an essential feature of a sustainable and healthy food system. It is
commonly understood to be fresher and more nutritious, as well as being better for the environment through avoidance of 'food miles' - excessive transport contributing to climate change and resulting in a loss of food quality and nutrition. Local food is also thought to help promote a more vibrant local economy through shorter food supply chains. Nonetheless, despite the easy claims that local food is inherently good, sustainable and healthy, there is currently significant concern that moves towards local food may increase existing social inequalities. Local food is perceived by many to be expensive, and often as not easily accessible, available only through specialist locations such as farmers' markets, rather than through supermarkets. If only those with considerable resources are able to consume local, sustainable and organic food, then existing health disparities between rich and poor may be increased and other inequalities compounded.
In this conflicted context, our distinctive analysis is that:
- definitions of local food are generally, and paradoxically, abstracted and universalised, rather than being tailored to
specific 'locals';
- current definitions of local food are usually top down and often exclude local stakeholders, in particular local residents, from discussions about food systems;
- many existing proposed solutions risk obscuring the interests of those on low incomes with regards to local, organic and more sustainable food and food systems.
Our partnership: To address these current challenges, we have developed a project built on a unique partnership with a successful local food organisation in an area of considerable social deprivation, vibrant community action and local pride.
Real Food Wythenshawe (RFW), based in South Manchester, are an experienced organisation with a solid track record of innovative community-focussed interventions in an area of significant deprivation. Their work has been recognised through the award of £1M of Big Lottery Funding, as well as through their growing national reputation.
Methods, aims and objectives: Our ambitious project aims to reconceptualise local food through community-based
participatory research. Our approach is based on excavating local food knowledges and practices through activities such as oral history interviews, photo shares, memory days, local mapping of available food, and archival research, and then creatively engaging local residents with the emergent data to reimagine a site-specific local food for the present and future. We will then use the data and findings to produce a series of outputs tailored to specific stakeholders, for further and wider impact on Wythenshawe and beyond.
Benefits and applications: In the context of a rapidly transforming landscape of food policy and food governance, we
anticipate that our outputs will be of considerable use to policy-makers and other stakeholders. Now is a crucial moment to ensure local residents and those who will be buying and consuming food are involved in these conversations. In addition to academic outputs, we have a well-developed and integrated plan of outputs focused on different stakeholders and addressing different spatial and temporal horizons, including: a new publicly available archived dataset on local food; a Strategic Plan for Food in Wythenshawe; a Toolkit for Reimagining Local Food which will propose a site-specific process for tracing and (re)making relationships between people and the food they consume, enabling other groups to produce food plans tailored to their own locale. Our Policy Briefing aimed at other stakeholders in food discussions will locate the importance and benefits of actively involving local residents in the context of the rapidly shifting policy landscape.","CAHSS","School of Social and Political Science","UK - Research Council","economic and social research council","UNITED KINGDOM","research grants","Niamh Moore","SOCIAL & POLITICAL STUDIES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=2910444",NA,584281.27,"534910.43","49370.85",NA,"467425.02",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"SPS",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-10-01,2020-03-31,"Anna Votsi",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Salford,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

2020,2021-06-15,"Unsuccessful","10932590","black ecologies: race and the long anthropocene","My project reads literature at the intersection of race and the environment, repositioning late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Black writers such as Frederick Douglass and Pauline Hopkins alongside contemporary Black authors including Alexis Pauline Gumbs and Marlon James, to demonstrate that many of the problems that define contemporary ecology have always been present in writing about chattel slavery and its afterlives. I ask how Black writing, from the nineteenth-century onwards, reframes the epoch we now know as the Anthropocene, arguing that literature allows us to understand the animating relationship between race and the environment while also providing space to imagine a world outside the joint violence of anti-Black racism and environmental destruction.

I am particularly excited about undertaking this work as it bridges the gap between three disparate conversations occurring in the environmental humanities, Black Studies, and literary criticism. Working at this intersection, my work uses literature as a way to both imagine and build a more sustainable and equitable future. That is, alongside tracing how the same political and economic forces have largely been responsible been responsible for both anti-Black violence and environmental destruction from the inception of chattel slavery to the present, I also look at how literature provides us with the opportunity to imagine a world outside of these twinned cycles. The goal of this research is to not only build a literary archive, but to translate this work into practice, arguing for the importance of literature in constructing alternate futures.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","british academy","UNITED KINGDOM","newton international fellowship","David Farrier","ENGLISH LITERATURE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10932590",NA,90855,"60570.00","30285.00",NA,"90855.00","NIF21\210341","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ODA","No",NA,2022-05-03,2024-05-03,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"External Applicant",NA

It also aims to respond to the underrepresentation of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and other people of colour) women writers in contemporary nature and place writing, at a time of global environmental crisis in which it is vital that we widen the frame and make space for alternative experiences of the natural world.","CAHSS","School of Literatures, Languages & Culture","UK - Research Council","ukri (formerly rcuk)","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","David Farrier","ENGLISH LITERATURE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=10584185",NA,8542,"8542.00","0.00",NA,"8542.00","NE/V020617/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","UK-Canada Globalink doctoral exchange scheme","LLC",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2021-04-01,2022-03-31,"Laura Bonsall",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

2017,2018-03-19,"Unsuccessful","6600075","tracking phosphorus to understand peatland algal bloom formation","Peatlands are vital to humanity by providing countless benefits and ecological services; removing carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere, storing and purifying water, mitigating floods and providing a unique habitat for many plants and
animal species.
Globally, peatlands have been damaged by human activities such as afforestation releasing rather than storing
carbon. To reverse this trend, >1 million hectares of peatland forestry are now being felled across the UK.
However, several years after the tree felling started, a new ecosystem threat in the form of algal blooms has appeared
in the nearby water bodies. Caused by excess phosphates, released during or after felling, algal blooms endanger
water quality, fish populations, animal habitats and recreational activities.
In this work, I aim to determine the fate of the main algal bloom promoter, phosphorus, in restored peatlands of the
world’s biggest blanket bog, the Flow Country, Scotland using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. I will characterise
the movement and the forms of phosphorus in the peat and water bodies relative to deforested plots. This research is
imperative for the development of mitigating strategies that must become part of restoration projects involving tree
felling in peatlands.

The BioMeLT project aims at developing new and innovative technologies for converting bioresidues or biowaste and excess
renewable electricity to liquefied biomethane (LBM) for maritime and heavy-duty road transport and reducing GHG
emissions and pollutants in Europe. The BioMeLT process shall be implemented to existing small and medium scale
(bio-)waste treatment plants switching to Pt-LBM mode whenever excess renewable electricity is available. For the BioMeLT
process, e.g. the unused EU municipal solid biowaste potential can be applied, covering the EU transport sector fuel
capacity.
As biomass gasification results in the most critical gas, the WoodRoll® gasification technology from CE will serve as uniform
starting point for evaluating the BioMeLT process chain. For small and decentralized application, a simple and robust
methanation concept is favourable in terms of costs and user-friendly operation. Therefore, three new and innovative
Biological Methanation (BM) concepts will be evaluated, covering intrinsic kinetics, optimization of mass transfer and back
coupling effects on the entire process chain. The project will contribute to extending the knowledge in the field of BM, which
will help to quantify the potentials of this promising technology. In parallel to the research on BM, gas upgrading and
liquefaction technologies will be optimized and adapted to the process chain’s needs. Sound reactor modelling will allow
scale-up of the process chain to demonstrator scale directly. The industrial partners cover the scope of all applied
technologies and will contribute to transferring the results into the market.
The implementation strategy and the use of renewable electricity complies with the EC SET plan and H2020 perspectives of
applying interconnections between the energy networks and offering power grid storage and flexibilization options.
Furthermore, it gives the EU LNG strategy a green perspective in short to mid term by substitution of LNG by LBM.","CSE","School of Engineering","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - secure, clean and efficient energy","Stefano Brandani","INSTI OF MATERIALS & PROCESSES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4048811",NA,230506.53,"184405.23","46101.30",NA,"230506.53","764041-1","NO","University of Edinburgh","H2020-LCE-2016-2017 LCE-06-2017","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-01-01,2020-12-31,"Paula Stevenson",NA,"Enzo Mangano, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Institute for Materials and Processes"

2019,2019-10-03,"Unsuccessful","8842764","application of genomic tools to improve mexican shrimp aquaculture","Shrimp is the most important aquaculture species in Mexico, and is worth
~£0.5 Bn per annum. The State of Sinaloa is the second biggest producer
nationally, contributing 38% of the total production, and approximately
15,000 people are employed by this industry.
Despite a positive production trend, Mexican shrimp farming has been
severely hampered by diseases in recent years by pathogens such as the
White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV). There are no vaccines or treatments
available to prevent or control this disease, therefore genetic technologies
to improve innate resistance of the shrimp are desirable.
DNA sequencing technologies have facilitated rapid development of
reference genomes and genotyping tools for many aquaculture species.
Research using these tools has shown that resistance to disease is
heritable, which can be exploited via breeding programs to decrease
mortality and, hence, improve production. The implementation of such
genetic technologies into Mexican shrimp aquaculture to tackle disease
threats requires (i) the development of suitable genomic tools, and (ii) the
training of technical personnel from academia and industry on their
application.
The purpose of this project is to setup a collaboration between specialists
in these fields from the UK (led by The Roslin Institute) and Mexico (led by
ICMYL-UNAM) to (i) organize a framework for mid-term joint research
projects, technical courses, workshops, academic visits, publications, (ii)
develop genomic tools to enable the application of the advanced breeding
technologies to Mexican shrimp aquaculture; and (iii) to engage with the
industry to realize the potential of these tools for impact on production.
Successful outputs will reduce disease outbreaks, and hence increase
sustainable growth of the Mexican shrimp industry in the mid-term. As a
consequence, the economic status of the people that depend both directly
and indirectly from this activity will be positively impacted.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Government","the british council","UNITED KINGDOM","newton institutional links grant","Ross Houston","ROSLIN INSTITUTE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=8842764",NA,49996.34,"49996.34","0.00",NA,"49996.34","527613437","NO","University of Edinburgh","Newton Fund Institutional Links June 2019 Call","Roslin","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance",NA,NA,NA,"ODA","No",NA,2020-02-17,2021-02-16,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Diego Robledo, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","Tim Bean, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,"National University of Mexico,Collaborator,HEI,MEXICO",NA,"DDI Tag only","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 1,Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 2,Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 3,DDI - Data Driven Innovation","The Roslin Institute"
2019,2019-09-27,"Unsuccessful","9158587","genomic selection to improve the efficiency and sustainability of tilapia aquaculture in south east asia","The vast majority of global aquaculture takes place in developing countries, where it helps address several UN Sustainable Development Goals, either directly through human consumption, or indirectly through economic growth. Innovation in aquaculture production has major potential to raise incomes of small-scale producers, and to add resilience to food systems supporting livelihoods in vulnerable regions. However, intensification of aquaculture poses environmental concerns, and increasing the efficiency of fish production systems is essential to meet this global demand in a sustainable manner.

Nile tilapia is arguably the world's most important food fish, and is one of the cheapest and most accessible source of animal protein, providing vital micro and macro nutrients for cognitive and physical development. However, substantial barriers to increasing tilapia aquaculture include variable production efficiency across diverse farming systems. Feed is the biggest cost in intensive fish farming systems, and reducing feed consumption for a given productivity level is therefore a key goal. Improved feed efficiency reduces the use of natural resources, including fish oil and fish meal, thus contributing to the preservation of marine ecosystems. Improved feed efficiency also reduces nutrient outputs which can be detrimental to the environment, and reduces energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with feed production.

Genetic improvement of feed efficiency in tilapia has major potential but is hampered by the operational challenge of high-throughput methods for recording feed efficiency, as well as lack of tools and optimised strategies to incorporate feed conversion traits into the breeding program goals. In this proposal, research outputs from previous BBSRC-funded projects relating to genomic selection and development of a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array for tilapia will be translated to achieve genetic improvement of feed efficiency, with Vietnam as an exemplar country.

The project was co-developed by scientists at The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh (UK), WorldFish, and The National Breeding Centre for Southern Freshwater Aquaculture (Vietnam). Together the team will perform a large scale feed efficiency trial at the breeding centre in Vietnam, where individual records will be matched to genotypes using the SNP array, genetic parameters will be estimated, and optimised methods for performing genomic selection will be tested. The results will be applied to select parent fish with high breeding values for feed conversion, and the performance of their progeny will be benchmarked against families with lower breeding values.

The tilapia strain with improved feed efficiency will be disseminated via the existing system of multiplication hatcheries and smallholder farmers in Vietnam. A workshop and promotional material will be developed to communicate the benchmarking trial results, and to encourage regular uptake of genetically improved stock by these stakeholders. The outputs will include economic and social benefits for the project partner and smallholder farmers in Vietnam, via reduced feed costs and more efficient production systems. The impacts extend to human health via provision of cheap and sustainable sources of animal protein and nutrients, and to the environment via reduced used of marine sourced feed ingredients and higher production output per unit of pond space.

While Vietnam is the exemplar country (4th largest aquaculture producer globally), the techniques developed will be applied in several other Asian countries where WorldFish supply genetically improved tilapia (Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Timor-Leste, Bangladesh, India). Therefore, the project has major potential to address the challenge of improving productivity and incomes of small scale producers with reduced environmental impact, and improving access to sustainable sources of animal protein.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Research Council","biotechnology and biological sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard","Ross Houston","ROSLIN INSTITUTE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9158587",NA,292702.79,"235219.79","57483.00",NA,"249103.67","BB/T012498/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","GCRF Translation Awards Joint BBSRC-NERC GCRF Research Translation Call Sustainable Enhancement of Agriculture and Aquaculture Production","Roslin","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2020-04-01,2022-01-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WorldFish Center,Subawardee,Charity,MALAYSIA|National Breeding Centre for Freshwater Aquaculture,Partner,Government,VIET NAM",NA,"DDI Tag only","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund,Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 3,DDI - Data Driven Innovation","The Roslin Institute"

Its suitability for aquaculture derives from its largely herbivorous diet, rapid growth rate and tolerance of high stocking density. Nile tilapia makes up the majority of tilapia production. This species originated in Africa, where it has been cultivated since Egyptian times, and was distributed into Asia in the mid-20th century1. Tilapia is now arguably the world’s most important foodfish, contributing to food and nutrition security of many nations. Selective breeding of tilapia for genetic improvement of key traits such as growth and disease resistance is a major goal of several multinational breeding companies and non-profit organisations. 

This proposed project to generate a genetics resource for commercial tilapia is a collaboration between The Roslin Institute (University of Edinburgh) and WorldFish, an international, non-profit research organization that works to reduce hunger and poverty across the world by improving fisheries and aquaculture. WorldFish’s Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) strain of Nile tilapia originated in the Philippines and the breeding programme was moved to Malaysia in 20022. GIFT has been bred for increased growth rate and successfully disseminated across the world. Since GIFT is the basis of the vast majority of commercial tilapia aquaculture worldwide, gathering data on genetic characteristics of these populations is essential to inform choice of base populations and breeding strategies to optimise genetic gain in commercial and non-profit tilapia aquaculture, thereby enabling benefit for farmers in many countries. 
	
Initial research by Roslin and WorldFish led to the development of a ThermoFisher Axiom SNP array to facilitate genomic selection in tilapia. The purpose of this proposal is to further evaluate this product and use it to address breeding-related questions relevant for the tilapia aquaculture industry. Therefore, this project will involve generation and analysis of whole-genome sequences (WGS) and SNP genotypes for tilapia from several tropical countries. This data will be exploited to test the performance on diverse populations of tilapia of the new SNP array. A secondary output will be the opportunity to identify “selection signatures,” regions of the genome associated with selective breeding and adaptation to particular environments. Previous work3 has demonstrated genotype-by-environment interactions in the GIFT strain, suggesting the possibility of environment-specific breeding schemes. Investigating environmental adaptation in GIFT will help inform this decision, which has cost and logistical implications.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Research Council","biotechnology and biological sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","institute assessment ispg full","Pam Wiener","ROSLIN INSTITUTE","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7796073","RI8021",16040,"16040.00","0.00",NA,"16040.00","RI8021","NO","University of Edinburgh","ISPG November 2018 Pump-priming","Roslin",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-11-01,2019-07-31,"Natasha Curley",NA,"Andrea Wilson, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","Jorge Del-Pozo, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","Ross Houston, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DDI Tag only","Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 1,Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 2,Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 3,DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)","The Roslin Institute"

Recent developments in genomics have advanced innovation in European aquaculture. However, despite the creation of
reference quality genome sequences for the main species, our understanding of genome functions remains limited. AQUAFAANG will deliver a step improvement in understanding of genome function and exploitation of genotype-to-phenotype
prediction in the six most important European farmed fish species. The project brings together world-leading interdisciplinary
expertise and industry partners providing direct pathways to commercial exploitation. AQUA-FAANG will functionally
annotate the genomes of all six species, employing standardized experimental assays and analysis pipelines defined by the
FAANG initiative. AQUA-FAANG datasets will be shared and coordinated with other FAANG initiatives via the FAANG data
coordination centre, and made available through the Ensembl genome browser. As infectious disease is of paramount
concern for sustainable aquaculture, the project focuses on understanding functional genomic regions in both healthy and
immune-challenged fish. This will improve knowledge of the genomic basis for disease resistance and is complemented by
novel approaches to increase understanding of immune cell heterogeneity. Standardized comparative analyses will provide
essential insights into genome functions that cannot be gained from study of single species. Functional assays will be used
to study intermediate phenotypes and prioritise causative genetic variants in trait-associated genomic regions to accelerate
selection of disease-resistant stocks. Functionally-enriched marker panels will be developed to improve accuracy of genomic
selection. An active programme of stakeholder engagement and dissemination will ensure uptake of project outputs by
industry, academia, the public and in policy. The outputs will enhance precision breeding, drive competitiveness within the

CHANGE - CCUS wHole system Advances for cleaN enerGy in Europe
Although Europe benefits from a rapid increase in wind and solar power, this renewable energy system (RES) can be asynchronous with demand. Security of supply can only be guaranteed when conventional power plants are used to balance the grid. Future fossil power will therefore need to operate flexibly. Also, energy intensive industries, industrial processes that emit CO2, and H2 production all rely on fossil energy. It is widely recognised that carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) will be needed to decarbonise these emitters. Capture plants will produce fluctuating CO2 streams, requiring flexible operation which creates a number of fundamental challenges that CHANGE will address through targeted, low-TRL research and leveraging national programs. CHANGE will create a European Common Research and Innovation Agenda to support the SET Action Plan. CHANGE is a proposal from the EERA CCS Joint Programme which will benefit from the capacity within its wider 39 participants.
CHANGE will develop optimized flexible CCUS infrastructure plans in a new European RES. CHANGE will increase the adoption of three novel capture technologies, including a concept that can switch between H2 and electricity production, a nano-based post combustion technology and Calcium Looping technology integrated with solar energy. New supply chains will be identified by investigating conversion of CO2 to fuels during high RES availability. CHANGE will reduce CO2 transport and storage costs by macro-regional infrastructure planning and optimise CO2 storage management that is integrated with emerging low-carbon energy sectors. It will lower costs and risks by improving thermodynamic modelling of impure CO2 transport and by improving monitoring CO2 quality. CHANGE will build a networking platform for CCUS in four European regions, and provide action plans to meet their specific needs.","CSE","School of Engineering","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - secure, clean and efficient energy","Hannah Chalmers","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=2725548",NA,100083.63,"80066.90","20016.73",NA,"100083.63","731180","NO","Stiftelsen SINTEF","H2020-LCE-2016-2017","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-01-01,2019-12-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Mathieu Lucquiaud, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Stiftelsen SINTEF,Lead,Industry,NORWAY|Natural Environment Research Council,Collaborator,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM|Nederlandse Organisatie Voor Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek - TNO,Collaborator,Industry,NETHERLANDS|Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale - OGS,Collaborator,Industry,ITALY|Stichting Energieonderzoek Centrum Nederland,Collaborator,Industry,NETHERLANDS|Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,Collaborator,Industry,ITALY|Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres,Collaborator,Government,FRANCE|Danmarks Tekniske Universitet,Collaborator,HEI,DENMARK|Tallinna Tehnikaulikool,Collaborator,Industry,ESTONIA|Ethniko Kentro Erevnas Kai Technologikis Anaptyxis,Collaborator,Industry,GREECE| International Research Institute Of Stavanger AS,Collaborator,Industry,NORWAY|Institutul National De Cercetare-Dezvoltare Pentru Geologie Si Geoecologie,Collaborator,Industry,ROMANIA|Institutul De Studii Si Proiectari Energetice Sa,Collaborator,Industry,ROMANIA",NA,NA,"-","Institute for Energy Systems"

2016,2016-12-13,"Unsuccessful","3897311","appropriate technologies for water treatment and utilisation for the sustainable development and re-afforestation of turkana county (northern kenya)","This project addresses the issue of scarcity of fresh water in arid areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, as exemplified in the
Turkana County in North West Kenya where most of the water available for human consumption or agricultural use is
extracted from boreholes. All too often, this water is harmful due to its salinity content, and the need for desalination is
acute but largely unmet.
We propose using the locally abundant sunshine and wind for powering desalination. However, local communities or
businesses will only adopt desalinating systems that are cheap enough to procure, build, operate and maintain using local
materials, skills and supply chains. One such 'appropriate' technology here would be reflective parabolic troughs that focus
solar light onto pipes where the water is circulated. The resulting water vapour is then condensed to fresh water. The
remaining saline water also gets sterilised, and may be kept for other uses like washing.
The main objectives are described as follows:
1. Investigate appropriate business models and the development of local ownership and stewardship of desalination units.
This includes: documenting the availability of relevant technical skills and suppliers in Turkana and Kenya, and the local
market for water purification; checking compliance with regulations; and studying the wider social environment and
governance of water resources, esp. gender, age, and the co- existence of multiple communities including pastoralists,
farmers and refugees, so that we help ensure fair access, avoid conflict and facilitate adoption of the technology.
2. Develop appropriate designs and construction for desalinating devices, including prototypes and prototype testing. In
particular: A parabolic trough as previously described; and a device that captures moisture from the air. The systems will be
built and deployed in the field, and their performance monitored to enhance design and operation. Trials on the ground will
also address issues of scale formation and bacteriological quality of water. Specifications and preliminary designs will be
produced to supply markets and stakeholders identified in WP1, and local partners encouraged to promote prototype
deployment.
3. Investigate the use of the water for irrigation and re-afforestation. Trees are a critical market for water use. They can
transform the local economy and even the local climate, and people rely on them for shade, fruit and timber. We will
investigate the best use of both the desalinated water and the resultant brine by-product for agricultural, horticultural and
pastoralist activities. Some tree species that are both tolerant to salinity and of economic interest (esp. fruit trees) will be
planted in selected areas, with due consideration given to the drainage of water from these areas to avoid contamination of
freshwater bodies.
4. A virtual ""Joint Institute for Research and Training in Water and Energy Access"" to continue and amplify this project
beyond the grant period. Drawing on the advice of local stakeholders (community groups, NGOs and officials), and the
combined expertise of its members (namely: the University of Edinburgh, the Kenya Forestry Research Institute, the
University of Strathmore based in Nairobi, the University of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Science and Technology, and The
East-African branch of UK-based NGO Practical Action), the Institute will devise research programmes as well as training
programmes for local communities, entrepreneurs, craftsmen, engineers, scientists and policymakers.
5. Demonstrating prototypes to local stakeholders. This will encourage communities, entrepreneurs and officials to adopt
and deploy the technology. For this purpose, we will also produce a clear manual and Youtube videos, and the
demonstration of prototypes, both in operation and also in construction, with involvement of local artisans and of
communities seeking to remedy the quality of their borehole water.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","global challenges research fund","Dimitri Mignard","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3897311",NA,1213155.72,"998223.72","214932.00",NA,"1007676.58","EP/P029787/1","YES","University of Edinburgh","Tackling global development challenges through engineering and digital technology research","ENG","Pre Award - Official Development Assistance","Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund",NA,NA,"GCRF","No",NA,2017-05-01,2020-04-30,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Dan van der Horst, School of GeoSciences","Kate Heal, School of GeoSciences","Giulio Santori, School of Engineering","Jean-Benoit Falisse, School of Social and Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pre Award - Official Development Assistance,Pre Award - Global Challenges Research Fund","Institute for Energy Systems"

2018,2018-11-12,"Unsuccessful","7410310","improved phosphorus and eutrophication status assessments for humic lakes in light of climate change pressures and departure from eu directive","Phosphorus is an essential component of most living organisms but it can also cause excessive growth of algae in surface
waters even when it is present at relatively low concentrations (10s of parts per billion). This process is called
eutrophication and it is a problem because costly management plans often need to be actioned to restore the quality of the
water, e.g. to achieve good or high status as currently required under the European Union Water Framework Directive.
Recently, it has been observed that phosphorus concentrations in surface waters, especially lakes in upland, organic-rich
catchments, are increasing and this is being linked to climatic change. Firstly, transport from the surrounding catchment is
being enhanced by increased loss of dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus, which is associated with the organic
carbon via bridging links with iron, is co-transferred to the lake waters. Secondly, internal loading of phosphorus in the lake
bottom sediments is leading to increased concentrations in lake waters because of climatic change. This is because
increased periods of stormy weather leads to greater re-suspension of bottom sediments and transfer of phosphorus from
the near-surface sediment porewaters (the water directly in contact with the sediment). It also occurs because there is
increased stratification even in shallow lakes which are a common feature in many upland, organic-rich areas and this can
mean that poorly oxygenated sediments are in more frequent contact with the bottom lake waters. These conditions are
conducive to transfer of phosphorus from the sediment into the lake water.
Although it is known that soluble reactive phosphorus (orthophosphate) is the main form which can be taken up by the
bloom-forming organisms in the water, total phosphorus is the currently used model parameter to determine water quality.
With total phosphorus concentrations increasing, it is likely that more and more lakes will not achieve the required good or
high status. However, we don't know how much of this additional phosphorus is available to aquatic organisms. For
example, if most of it is unavailable, management plans may be enacted where they are not needed.
From an initial screen of the literature, there is a large body of published information from studies in many parts of the world
and from many different disciplines that needs to be critically evaluated and drawn together to address this knowledge gap.
The main aim of this proposal is to carry out a systematic review of the literature and to draw together evidence that will
improve our understanding of the (i) processes controlling the transport of phosphorus from catchment soil to lake water,
and (ii) how phosphorus is cycled from bottom sediments tot lake water, under the pressure of climate change, in organic
rich regions of the world.
The outcomes of this systematic review of the literature will be to inform future research on how climate change will affect
(i) the forms of phosphorus and its associations with natural organic matter in catchment runoff and lake waters and (ii) the
availability of different forms of phosphorus for uptake by aquatic organisms in highly coloured lakes located in organic-rich
regions of the world. This will ultimately facilitate development of more accurate, climate change-proof models for use in
assessing the phosphorus concentration of lakes in carbon-rich zones will be of tremendous direct benefit to the UK's
environmental regulators (e.g. the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) and policy makers
(e.g. DEFRA) and to their equivalent organisations in other countries.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","UK - Research Council","natural environment research council","UNITED KINGDOM","innovation","Margaret Graham","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7410310",NA,99939.71,"62380.60","37559.11",NA,"79951.77","NE/S016023/1","NO","University of Edinburgh","Environmental Evidence for the Future 2018","GEO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-01-01,2019-12-31,"David Dougal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Keele University,Partner,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

avoiding iLUC and transforming biomass into clean liquid biofuel. The consortium includes partners from Italy, Belgium,
Greece, Spain, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Kingdom. PhyToFuel will also assess and mitigate the short and the long term
environmental risks connected to the preparation of lands for phytoremediation, adopting an all-embracing monitoring
system of the whole process from contaminated land to clean liquid biofuel in two test sites. In this project, pyrolysis is
proposed as a viable option for the treatment of contaminated biomasses given its capability to function as a multiproduct
provider (e.g., biofuels, bulk chemicals, supply of surplus power and heat. A special attention will be given to the
concentration of PTEs in the char, to the reduction of their mobility and to the energy efficiency of the process. According to
a circular economy vision a synergic approach will be adopted coupling the phytoremediation practice and the biofuel
production to the valorization of each material flux through the production of energy and materials that may be used in
assisting the different steps of the whole production chain. An integrated qualitative and quantitative framework, namely
Quantitative Story Telling, will be adopted to evaluate environmental, technical and socio-economic performance of the
phytoremediation-feedstock-transformation chain and the overall sustainability of this complex metabolic system. To reach
the ambitions and expected impact of the PhyToFuel project a plan of communication & dissemination, as well as
exploitation of the activities results will be set up. This plan will be strictly linked to the activity of exploitation of PhyToFuel,
seeking to generate knowledge outside academic environments to the benefit of the social, cultural and economic
development.","CSE","School of Engineering","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","horizon 2020 - secure, clean and efficient energy","Xianfeng Fan","INSTI OF MATERIALS & PROCESSES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9990344",NA,346535.37,"277228.29","69307.07",NA,"346535.37","101006924","NO","University of Naples Federico II (Universita Degli Studi Di Napoli Federico II)","Combined clean biofuel production and phytoremediation solutions from contaminated lands worldwide","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-12-01,2024-11-30,"Karen Sooy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Naples Federico II (Universita Degli Studi Di Napoli Federico II),Lead,HEI,ITALY|Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,Collaborator,Industry,ITALY|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,Collaborator,HEI,BELGIUM|Universitat Autonoma De Barcelona,Collaborator,HEI,SPAIN|Ethniko Kentro Erevnas Kai Technologikis Anaptyxis,Collaborator,Industry,GREECE",NA,NA,"Application Indicative Submitted",NA

2015,2016-05-17,"Successful","2732630","biofuels production from lignocellulosic biomass via supercritical technologies","Biomass is one of the most promising sources for the production of renewable fuels and chemicals. However, the
commercial technology to convert these feedstocks to fuels and chemicals are very few. Biomass usually contains
water since the drying process is energy-intensive; the super critical water (SCW) gasification is a promising
technology for biomass with high moisture contents. Bio-oil is made by biomass pyrolysis. Bio-oils can also be
processed to produce value added chemicals. One of such potential chemical is phenol (phenols, substituted
phenols and their derivatives), which normally comes as lignin degradation product during flash pyrolysis. These
phenols are most promising alternative to petro-derived phenols which find huge market in resin, composite
wood and laminate industry. The supercritical CO2 extraction emerges as a new technology for natural phenols,
which has advantage over traditional solvent extraction process by eliminating the polluting organic solvents.
Supercritical fluid processing of biomass to chemicals represents an alternative path to enzymatic hydrolysis of
cellulose to sugars or thermo-chemical gasification process. The major focus of the research work is to develop
the following technologies: I) Conversion of biomass to value added chemicals such as fermentable sugars
specifically glucose or fuel gas such as methane using supercritical water and its further conversion to ethanol,
and II) Extraction of the phenolic fractions from bio-oil using supercritical carbon dioxide. The major goal of the
proposed research work is to develop an integrated process for the complete conversion of biomass to ethanol
and phenols using supercritical technology. The long term goal of the present research is to develop an
integrated process for complete utilization of biomass for the production of chemicals and fuels using
supercritical fluid techniques. It is expected that this new lignocellulosic biomass technology will enable the
development of bio-refineries which will produce value added chemicals together with biofuels.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Charity","royal academy of engineering","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Ying Zheng","INSTI OF MATERIALS & PROCESSES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=2732630","R44573",6000,"6000.00","0.00",NA,"6000.00","DVF1617\5\47","NO","University of Edinburgh","Distinguished Visiting Fellowships - Round 5","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2016-10-24,2017-08-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Heriot-Watt University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Saskatchewan,Collaborator,HEI,CANADA",NA,NA,"-","Institute for Materials and Processes"

To determine the most promising technologies, it is key to be able to explore the design space at early stages to avoid expensive design-build-test iterations later on. This can be done with the help of improved tools for early stage design and optimisation of Wave Energy Converters (WECs). This project aims to combine a flexible geometry optimisation tool with a moment-based constrained optimal control mathematical framework (able to maximise power extraction from ocean waves), so that the WEC hull geometry and the control system can be optimised simultaneously and a wide range of innovative solutions can be generated. This methodology not only allows for a better representation of the system dynamics including device limitations, such as stroke, velocity and PTO-force constraints, but given the computational efficiency of the moment-based control strategy, this energy-maximising framework is suitable for joint geometry and control optimisation. More realistic optimisation
results will be generated with this method, which will aid technology developers to improve their WEC designs at the early stages, and funding bodies to assess current designs and their potential for
improvement with respect to the theoretical optima.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","supergen ore hub","Anna Garcia Teruel","SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=9439814",NA,5020.9,"5020.90","0.00",NA,"4016.72",NA,"NO","University of Plymouth","Supergen Hub ECR Researcher Research Fund","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-11-18,2020-08-18,"Andy Liken",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Plymouth,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"-",NA

2.1. Fostering renewable energies and energy efficiency

Wave energy is called upon to play a role in the European energy mix but
significant obstacles still exist. SIWEIS will foster wave energy growth through
integration with other maritime uses (transport, energy, aquaculture). Using
Blue Economy priority sectors, 5 main obstacles will be addressed: reliability;
survivability; sustainability; LCOE and environmental integration. The main
outputs will be a GIS tool and an integrated strategy to leverage wave energy
under a transnational approach.

The aim of this project is to achieve sustainable integration of wave energy
into the AA economy by means of innovative synergies with other maritime
activities (transport, energy, aquaculture & support services). Wave
energy is one of the most promising marine renewable resources and one
of the Blue Growth Priorities. Almost 45% of wave energy developers are
European and a new, homegrown industrial sector is emerging. However, the
wave energy sector is at a crucial stage where cost and risk reduction are
needed in order to attract investors. The overarching objective of SIWEIS is
to develop an integrated AA strategy to accelerate wave energy development
from basic research to demonstration projects, through the integration of wave
energy converters with existing and mature maritime economic activities.
Three specific objectives will be addressed: (1) identify synergies between
wave energy and other maritime activities and classify the AA potential
for a multiuse maritime space approach; (2) cluster wave energy resource
availability, focusing on met-ocean conditions, socio-economic benefits and
synergies with other uses; (3) identify the most relevant technological needs
for wave energy developers in the AA in order to maximize the rate of success
and minimize risks/costs of demonstration projects. The results obtained
from SIWEIS will impact on the current situation by characterizing the socioeconomic
impact of wave energy development and integration in the AA.","CSE","School of Engineering","EU - Government","european commission","BELGIUM","interreg iv","Henry Jeffrey","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3028360",NA,160714.28,"142546.43","18167.86",NA,"120535.71","EAPA_374/2016","NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2017-06-01,2020-05-31,"Katherine Quinn",NA,"Adrian De Andres, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-","Institute for Energy Systems"

Needs addressed
The primary challenge for the wave energy sector is to develop a technology that can efficiently convert ocean energy resources at a competitive Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). This begins with the engineering challenges at the prototype stage. However, this cost competitiveness needs to follow through the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) to commercial-scale projects. In recent years, developers have largely focused on improving conversion efficiency, both mechanical and electrical. However, lack of standard marine electrical architecture for the next stage of development has led to only limited improvements in array electrical systems. In the case of wave energy devices, this issue has a significant impact when it comes to defining the devices internal electrical design and electrical network, as Wave Energy Converters (WECs) need to demonstrate efficient and economically feasible concepts that can be easily integrated into offshore networks.
State of the art
Previous studies have analysed various network architectures for ocean energy systems. However only a few studies detail the expected Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) of proposed solutions. The works that specify potential CAPEX and OPEX outlays do not give ocean energy developers the information necessary to optimise device, array and transmission level electrical architectures.
Project goals
The first goal of this project is to define an optimal high-level Wave Energy Converter (WEC) internal electrical architecture aimed at minimising LCOE. The second, and primary goal of the project, is to study preferred, optimised array electrical architectures for sub-10MW and early commercial arrays. By considering both electrical design stages at such an early stage of development the project will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the trade-offs within a coordinated design process of a commercial scale WEC array.
At both WEC and array levels, the proposed architectures will use available technologies, where possible, to ensure cost-effectiveness and accessibility to the widest range of developers. The European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) wave test site will be used as a case study for design, which will allow an early stage assessment of future early commercial arrays to be developed. This will provide a clear guidance for the development of future WEC prototypes and early commercial systems, in order to maximize performance and value, whilst minimizing complexity and technical risk, at each stage of development and deployment.

Project approach
The consortium will approach the work by initially focussing on the CorPower (CPO) WEC; both at a WEC and an array level. All electrical analysis will be performed using commercially available software and CPO’s architecture will be compared to known alternatives using LCOE as the comparison metric. The proposed architectures will use existing and available technologies, where possible, to ensure cost effectiveness and accessibility to the widest range of developers. This approach will also de-risk the technologies for other developers.
A case study will be formulated for an array of CPO devices deployed at the EMEC. This approach is being taken due to the availability of both CPO and EMEC operational data. The operational data will calibrate and validate the models used in the analysis of the various architectures.
Expected results and impacts
This work is intended to build upon existing studies and guidelines to allow ocean energy developers, and more specifically wave energy developers, to make informed decisions regarding system electrical architectures. This work will allow developers to improve their integration with the electrical grid. Thus, guiding them toward a better and faster insertion into the European and global electricity market.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Government","scottish enterprise","UNITED KINGDOM","proof of concept (tr)","Henry Jeffrey","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=2863498",NA,152573.8,"98275.12","54298.68",NA,"76286.90","319","NO","Corpower Ocean AB","OCEANERA-NET Joint Call 2016","ENG",NA,NA,NA,"Translational (TR)","NoFlag","No",NA,2017-01-01,2018-12-31,"Katherine Quinn","John Jeffrey","Adrian De Andres, School of Engineering","Aristides Kiprakis, School of Engineering",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Corpower Ocean AB,Lead,Industry,SWEDEN|TNEI Services Ltd,Collaborator,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM|European Marine Energy Centre,Collaborator,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"ERI - Business Development Team","Institute for Energy Systems"

Wave energy converter (WEC) technology is not yet sufficiently developed enough to achieve acceptable techno-economic performance or commercial applicability, both of which are required if WECs are to become economically viable. 
State of art
Based on discussions with industry experts, it is estimated that individual companies need to invest in the order of £50 million over five years to bring a WEC from being proven at part-scale to demonstration at full-scale. A key obstacle is pre-commercial technology finance, particularly funding to support device and component developers in the middle ground from the key TRL 3 and upwards stages (to TRL6) in the evolution of their projects. 
Some floating wind technologies are, nowadays, in demonstration phases achieving a TRL 7-8, taking advantage of the success of offshore wind which is achieving an energy cost of around 10 pence per kWh. It may be shared in order to reduce the final cost of WEC implementation the synergies between WEC technology and other marine technologies which are already in demonstration phase.
Planned goals
This project will investigate the business models currently in use by WEC technology developers and will propose revised models aimed at leveraging greater funding and reducing investor risk. 
Furthermore, it has become apparent that the implementation of new funding strategies is crucial if investor confidence in the sector is to be improved.  Large investors with significant backing, from both the public and private sectors, need to be engaged from the outset to provide confidence that projects will survive.  One such investment model involves innovative public acquisition, whereby a research centre is funded to select a WEC technology from the market and work to validate it.  Private sector acquisition would follow the validation phase and a developer would take ownership of the technology in order to implement it in a commercial setting.
The project will be focused on addressing three main targets:
a.	The lessons learnt from other successful marine energy sectors business models which could provide beneficial if transferred to WEC technology developers will be investigated.  
b.	Aspects of the technology development process which exhibit the greatest potential for cost reduction and best practices will be analysed, with particular focus on operations and maintenance activities. 
c.	Finally, innovative financial mechanisms involving public and private agents for WEC technology will be proposed.
Expected results
1.      New Business Models for WEC Developers: New insights that help to overcome the current obstacles, especially, related to pre-commercial technology finance.
2.      WEC Roadmap, coupled to the current floating wind & MuP demonstration projects, in order to take advantage of their momentum and obtain mutual benefits.
3.      New and innovative financial tools to enhance WEC demonstration projects, achieving public support and private commitment.
Potential impact
The ultimate impact of the proposed project will be to accelerate the commercialisation of wave energy technologies. This will entail bringing the cost and reliability, amongst other aspects, of wave technologies to a level where they are able to compete with alternatives such as floating wind.
Our project will offer a new pathway to accelerate the WEC technology through an in-depth analysis of other MER business models, technical synergies and new financial tools. First stage will be to achieve TRL-6 (WEC demonstration project) coupled with some floating wind or MuP project.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Government","scottish enterprise","UNITED KINGDOM","proof of concept (tr)","Henry Jeffrey","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=2875607",NA,65862.07,"44768.07","21094.00",NA,"32931.04",NA,"NO","IH Cantabria","OCEANERA-NET Joint Call 2016","ENG",NA,NA,NA,"Translational (TR)","NoFlag","No",NA,2017-01-01,2018-12-31,"Katherine Quinn","John Jeffrey",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"IH Cantabria,Lead,Industry,SPAIN|SgurrEnergy Ltd,Collaborator,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM|Wave Energy Centre - Centro de Energia das Ondas,Collaborator,Industry,PORTUGAL",NA,NA,"ERI - Business Development Team","Institute for Energy Systems"

Delivering Research Impact Developing Leaders Shaping Capability

Strategy - The UKCCSRC will bring strategy to UK academic CCS research in support of government targets.

Impact - will be maximised by providing a national focal point for CCS R&D to bring together the user community and

academics to analyse problems, devise and carry out world-leading research and share delivery. A key priority will be to

help rebuild the UK economy by driving an integrated research programme focused on maximising the contribution of CCS

to a low-carbon energy system for UK.

Research will be linked to the following pathways to impact in future stages of CCS deployment:

a) Maximise the learning from the DECC CCS demonstration programme to reduce costs and risks for subsequent CCS

projects to.

b) Develop a knowledge base for rollout of CCS as part of UK electricity sector decarbonisation in the 2020s, including for

the life of this CCS infrastructure until 2050 and beyond.

c) Prepare for extensive deployment of CCS to meet UK 2050 targets, including CCS on industry, very low residual

emissions from CCS on fossil fuels and negative emissions from biomass with CCS.

Leaders - The UKCCSRC will cross institutional and disciplinary boundaries to bring together visionary leaders able to set

research agendas that fully combine the intersecting fields of knowledge required to maximise the potential of CCS,

inspirational team leaders for complex, long-term research programmes, and will also provide leadership development

opportunities for early- and mid-career researchers.

Capability - The UK CCS Research Centre will provide CCS researchers with the space, support and opportunities to foster

creativity and to empower them to deliver the highest quality long-term research in CCS areas where there is current or

future national need.

The activities of the UKCCSRC will be overseen by a broadly-based independent Board, reporting to RCUK and other

funders. A Management Team made up of the Principal Investigator/Director and eight Co-Investigators plus a Secretariat

will be responsible for running the Centre. Nine additional Research Area Champions will also help cover the wide range of

different specialised knowledge fields involved in implementing CCS systems.

The existing UK CCS Community Network will be operated by the Centre, giving a fully inclusive forum for UK CCS

stakeholders and a route for all UK academics to engage with the UKCCSRC.

The UKCCSRC initial funding supports a core research programme (£3M) that covers a number of evident gaps in existing

research and also includes scoping research in areas likely to be of strategic importance. It also funds shared national

facilities (£2M plus £2.9M from DECC). A further £1.5M has been set aside for flexible seed funding to be allocated on a

competitive basis for emerging strategic research needs.

Academic Beneficiaries

Describe who will benefit from the research [up to 4000 chars].

The Centre will be expanded by a number of routes:

a) Academic researchers on existing and new CCS projects will be invited to link these to the Centre.

b) Non-academic partners in projects that are linked to the Centre may become UKCCSRC Affiliates

c) Additional funding for UKCCSRC research programmes will be sought from RCUK and other UK and international

government-funded sources and also from industry.

Research and Pathways to Impact Delivery (RAPID)

The key overall strategy for future UKCCSRC expansion is to couple research with impact from the outset. Proposed

research will have to be linked to plausible routes to deliver a positive impact for CCS deployment. The RAPID process will

run throughout the course of the UKCCSRC with results summarised in a RAPID Handbook, updated yearly.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Research Council","engineering and physical sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard","Hannah Chalmers","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3461670","RA3844 & RA3845 linked to RA3843",462805,"415830.00","46975.00",NA,"370244.00","146912","YES","University of Sheffield","UK CCS Centre Hub","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2016-01-01,2017-09-30,"Michael Hunter",NA,"Stefano Brandani, School of Engineering","Mathieu Lucquiaud, School of Engineering","Stuart Haszeldine, School of GeoSciences",NA,NA,NA,"University of Cambridge,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Strathclyde,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Manchester,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Newcastle,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Leeds,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Nottingham,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Sheffield,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Cranfield University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Natural Environment Research Council,Collaborator,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM|Durham University,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine,Collaborator,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM|Plymouth Marine Laboratory,Collaborator,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,"DDI Tag only","DDI Hub - AgriTech Hub (Easter Bush)","Institute for Energy Systems"

2016,2016-08-02,"Successful","3444163","nmdeveloping new modelling capabilities of regenerative heat exchanges for low temperature applications in carbon capture","The objective of this project is to further develop new engineering options to reduce water usage in carbon capture systems for power generation, steelworks, oil refineries, cement plants with regenerative heat exchanger technology. A 9 month secondment within the Howden Group will allow developing new software tools to evaluate performance and size rotary heat exchanger products for carbon capture. Specific challenges include low temperature operation (30 – 100 ºC) and the condensation and evaporation of water within the wheel, as opposed to high temperature operation at 150-350 ºC for coal-fired power plant applications where water behaves as vapour. This requires adding to the existing software code a stand-alone model using engineering principles, which the secondee acquired during her PhD studies at Edinburgh University. 

The proposed work plan consists of: 
• Gain a deep understanding of the fundamental principles and the source code of Howden’s proprietary software used for performance analysis and sizing. 
• Fully identify the new expected operational conditions when rotary heat exchangers are implemented in carbon capture systems covering a wide range of operation temperatures. 
• Assess the effects/implications of a low temperature application on the rotary heat exchangers performance and sizing 
• Provide detailed technical description of all the phenomena involved (e.g. water condensation, water evaporation) and a technical report to enable Howden’s program modifications. 
• Develop a stand-alone simplified model of the rotary heat exchangers including the water condensation/evaporation phenomena taking place at low temperature. 


Upon completion of the project, a first important step towards rolling out a new tool for sizing of equipment in carbon capture applications to Howden’s engineering teams will have been completed. The following phase, beyond this project, would consist of continuing the roll out within the company to the commercial teams.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Industry","howden group limited","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme","Mathieu Lucquiaud","INSTI OF MATERIALS & PROCESSES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3444163","R83620",5979,"5979.00","0.00",NA,"5979.00","ENG2082 - IAA Secondment Project for Laura Herraiz","NO","University of Edinburgh","EPSRC IAA KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER SECONDMENT","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2016-06-01,2017-02-28,"Katherine Quinn","John Jeffrey",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ERI - Business Development Team","Institute for Energy Systems"

2018,2019-02-18,"Pending","7928796","socio-ecological dynamics of infectious disease at the livestock-human-wildlife interface.","Wildlife diseases affect livestock, hunting, and conservation interests and involve
anthropogenic decisions that affect and are affected by disease transmission and associated risks. These
coupled systems generally involve multiple hosts distributed over geographically and socioeconomically
heterogeneous landscapes. These complexities create many challenges for resource managers tasked with
constructing coherent, cost-effective and workable disease control strategies. Our proposed research is
designed to address these challenges by investigating the overarching research question ""How do the
spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission interact with human risk responses to
influence risk-management decisions for complex disease networks that bridge natural and managed
landscapes?"".Specifically, our cross-disciplinary team will investigate: (i) how animal and land use
management decisions over geographically and socioeconomically heterogeneous landscapes create or
mitigate disease risks to wildlife and livestock, and how these effects and associated risk-management
opportunities differ across landscapes and from those in aspatial settings; (ii) the natural cross-system
""communities"" that influence decision-making and control; (iii) the important socioeconomic-ecological
tradeoffs for managing disease risks in complex spatial networks with different characteristics, and how
targeted management strategies might be developed to reflect these tradeoffs. Conceptually, we will
develop a spatial, ""multiscale socioeconomic-ecological multi-layer network"" framework to understand
the epidemiological, population, and behavioral dynamic interactive feedbacks among the economic and
ecological subsystems. Using bioeconomic modeling and adaptive management approaches, we will
examine cost-effective management in this complex setting. Further insights will be gained via two case
studies: (a) bovine tuberculosis in Michigan deer and cattle; (b) brucellosis in Greater Yellowstone Area

2018,2018-11-23,"Pending","7313915","us-uk collab: integration of epidemiology and social science for better wildlife and farm management of a multi-host pathogen","In this proposal, we shall address the critical question of integrating social science and economic perspectives into
quantitative models applied to real-life problems of infectious disease management in livestock and wildlife. We shall
exploit two exceptionally well-described systems (Michigan USA, and Great Britain) where bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) has a
substantial and long term cost to individuals in affected areas and to the broader public and where there are well
documented, dynamic tensions between the priorities of different stakeholders.
In Michigan, we shall consider the joint ecological and epidemiological problem of deer population management and cattle
Tb prevention in the context of the hunting and farming communities, where attempts to encourage hunters to engage in
deer population control have had mixed success, and risk mitigation interventions have great potential but the challenge
lies in farmers modifying their husbandry practices and behaviours.
In GB, we shall identify differences in the dynamic network of livestock movements when comparing Scotland to the Low
Risk Area (LRA) in England, and develop new estimates of the risk of acquiring bTB over those networks. By integrating
knowledge of risk perception into models of disease spread, we shall determine whether known differences in risk in
comparing Scotland to the LRA are due to epidemiological or farmer decision-making factors.
We shall (i) exploit exceptional, dense datasets in both these systems that describe both the host populations and disease
in order to estimate the benefits of adherence to good biosecurity practice, and (in Michigan) good wildlife management
practice and (ii) generate new data describing the social context of infectious disease spread. Integrating these data, we
shall synthesize a novel analytical framework via a suite of mathematical, agent-based simulation and network models in
order to (i) evaluate and optimise potential control strategies that account for epidemiological risk, human behaviour and
socio-economic context, (ii) test them in the context of the detailed agent-based simulations, and (iii) translate the agentbased
models to more generalised network models, facilitating further comparison and extension to other systems.","CMVM","Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies","UK - Research Council","biotechnology and biological sciences research council","UNITED KINGDOM","small grants","Rowland Kao","VETERINARY CLINICAL SCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=7313915",NA,624158.79,"388338.15","235820.65",NA,"499327.03",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","US-UK collaborative funding","Roslin",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-09-01,2023-08-31,"Hannah Wheeldon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Sheffield,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Minnesota,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED STATES",NA,NA,"Roslin ISPG 17/22 – Programme 2","The Roslin Institute"

2018,2019-03-22,"Unsuccessful","8015402","ecoclim: ecological responses to climate warming across biomes - ecological stability as community thermophilization linked to species thermal traits","Climate change is impacting biodiversity across the planet in the largest and fastest environmental shift in recent geological history. In this proposal, we aim to determine how species traits (primarily thermal traits) promote community stability in the face of this unprecedented change. Understanding the consequences of these changes, including effects on biotic interactions, demands an understanding of mechanisms at species level. We propose to use a combination of data synthesis and field case studies to analyse warming-related long-term changes in community structure. Such changes, due to range shifts and the decline in cold-affinity species and increase in warm-affinity ones, are here termed 'thermophilization'.

We aim to compare rates of thermophilization in ecological communities across multiple biomes at large scales addressing four hypotheses. 1. Communities comprised of species with wide temperature ranges will change less than those composed of narrow-ranged ones; 2. Communities made up of species with contrasting thermal affinities will change faster than those with similar ones; 3. Communities whose species have affinities to environments cooler than the location considered will be more susceptible to warming. 4. Species traits, including body size, dispersal and longevity, will influence thermophilization rates beyond expectations 1-3. Our consortium consists of marine and terrestrial ecologists aiming for general rules applicable across biomes and those specific to example ecosystems: North Atlantic fish, plankton and coastal biota, Arctic tundra, Great Barrier Reef coral reefs and communities studied by project partners. Species thermal ranges from distribution models using global data in biodiversity databases (such as OBIS and GBIF) will be used to calculate weighted-mean thermal affinities (Community Temperature Index, CTI) for measuring thermophilization rates. Expectations for hypotheses 1-4 will be developed using community simulation models based on species thermal performance curves for abundance. Effects on ecosystems will be assessed by scaling up from species traits to novel estimates of functioning, from productivity in plant communities through trophic structure on coral reefs and biogeochemical fluxes in North Sea benthos.

PI Mike Burrows (SAMS) will extract thermal traits using species distribution models combining climate measures and habitat information. Co-Is Maria Dornelas and Anne Magurran (St Andrews) will use the BIOTIME database of community time series to examine global patterns of biodiversity change, and will lead the field case study of community re-assembly following the recent mass thermal disturbance among reef corals. Co-I Isla Myers-Smith (Edinburgh) will address how the principles apply to Arctic tundra communities, and Co-I Martin Edwards (MBA) will do the same for North Atlantic plankton.
Subcontractors John Pinnegar, Bryony Townhill and Clement Garcia (Cefas) will examine change in European shellfish and invertebrate communities to incorporate findings into different management scenarios. Finally, our network of international project partners will test our primary hypotheses and models in a range of contrasting ecosystems.
The proposal will deliver operational metrics of the response of ecological communities to climate change across multiple ecosystems, evidence for the strength of response to changing climate so far, and a solid theoretical and analytical framework for projecting expected shifts in community composition and structure under future climate change. We will extend these responses to ecosystem scales by scaling up through species functional traits and altered interactions to novel estimates of functioning.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","UK - Research Council","natural environment research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard grant","Isla Myers-Smith","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=8015402",NA,448557.09,"301656.09","146901.00",NA,"358845.67",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh",NA,"GEO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2020-01-01,2022-12-31,"David Dougal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

.
.- (EMEC) to exploit, with the aim of improving their commercial service
• to their clients and to the benefit of the wider Offshore Renewable
Energy (ORE) industry, highly valuable data acquired over ten years
and multiple projects.
Three objectives have been identified:
(1) To conduct a review of EMEC’s archived data and to produce
a summary catalogue including ranking by value to the ORE
industry using EMEC’s customer requirements and leading
industrial national and EU ORE guidance documentation.
(2) A demonstration dataset, identified as of most value to
EMEC’s immediate customers, will be transferred, post
. processed, described and hosted by the University of
Edinburgh. This will also allow the level of demand for this
Data to be assessed at this early stage.
(3) A Data Management strategy will be developed and funding
opportunities will be investigated and pursued to enable
longer-term partnerships between EMEC and the Data
Science community.

For the past ten years EMEC has acquired data from their wave and
tidal test sites whilst working with 25 different devices from leading
technology developers around the world. This data includes
measurements of tidal flow speeds and ocean waves across all
seasons using multiple instrument types in multiple configurations.
Due to technical (e.g., data volumes and data complexity) and project,
staffing and resource constraints this data has to date been under
utilised from a commercial and wider research perspective.
This data is of import to EMEC from two perspectives. Firstly, it
provides long term data which if extracted, processed and made
downloadable to existing and future customers gives TEC and WEC
developers more knowledge about aspects of the environment around
which they design their devices. Long term variation in environmental
conditions is an important aspect of energy yield prediction and plays
a role in the planning and budgeting of Operations and Maintenance
tasks which can be significant costs in this sector. Secondly, through
coordination with academic partners the data has use in fundamental
research to underpin the industry with analysis results fed to
international guidance bodies in line with EMEC’s recent adaption of
IECTC114 and ISO 17025.
The project revolves around investigating and archiving the EMEC
owned complex and inhomogeneous dataset, using an identified key
subset as a demonstrator project to build a Data Management system
around and finally to work towards a future holistic Data Management
and client Data Provision strategy.","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Universities etc.","energy technology partnership (etp)","UNITED KINGDOM","general scheme (tr)","Brian Sellar","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=3675307","R44731",12000,"12000.00","0.00",NA,"12000.00","ETP Project Ref: ETP:PJ0175-M","NO","European Marine Energy Centre","ETP Knowledge Exchange Network Engagement Fund","ENG",NA,NA,NA,"Translational (TR)","NoFlag","No",NA,2016-10-01,2017-01-13,"Katherine Quinn","John Jeffrey",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Strathclyde,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|European Marine Energy Centre,Lead,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"ERI - Business Development Team","Institute for Energy Systems"

2015,2016-04-22,"Successful","2830699","united kingdom centre for marine energy research","Marine (or offshore) renewable energy has a large potential to deliver clean, secure and predictable energy. The United Kingdom has some of the largest natural resources (large waves, strong tidal currents and high winds) of any country in the world. The exploitation of these resources is critical to addressing the energy trilemma (of producing secure, cost affordable, low carbon energy). Indeed, it is likely that without marine energy the UK's ambitious 2050 carbon reduction targets cannot be met. However, Marine energy has significant challenges to overcome. Wave, tidal and wind turbines must be installed and operated in remote locations, where the water is deep and the ocean, weather and tides are highly energetic. To provide cost effective electricity, renewable energy devices must be inexpensive to manufacture, simple to install, reliable, easy to service and produce large quantities of energy. Achieving all of this within the hostile marine
environment is quite a challenge, however the prize is significant, providing not only clean energy, but significant
employment and export opportunities.

The United Kingdom Centre for Marine Renewable Energy (UKCMER) is a virtual centre, funded under RCUK's Energy
Programmes SUPERGEN initiative. UKCMER seeks to coordinate research in renewable electricity generation using the power of the waves, tidal currents and floating wind turbines. The UKCMER core comprises of The University of Edinburgh (who coordinate the programme), Cranfield University, Exeter University, Strathclyde University and Swansea University.

In addition to conducting a core research programme UKCMER acts as a hub to coordinate the activities of four additional Grand Challenge projects (EP/N021452/1, EP/N021487/1, EP/N020782/1 and EP/N02057X/1) looking at specific challenges for the marine energy sector.

Research in the fourth phase of UKCMER will focus on: methods to enhance the performance of tidal turbines that
recognise that arrays of machines are affected by both the interactions of the water flowing passed the devices and the
electrical infrastructure which collects the energy generated and sends it to the grid. The development of design tools to assist in the optimal design of wave energy converters, tidal turbines and floating wind turbines that account for the random nature of both the waves and turbulence in the marine environment. Methods to explore the response of wave energy converters, tidal turbines and floating wind turbines to extreme loading events, recognising that such events arise from a combination of steep (rather than large waves) and the state of the device when the waves reach it. Examining how the wakes of tidal turbines deployed in farms interact with each other so that the power production from the farm can be optimised. And finally, how new designs and materials can improve the structural integrity of offshore renewable energy converters. The research programme has been designed to be complementary to the existing grand challenge projects and will make use of early results from these projects.
UKCMER leads the UK's international outreach activities and has developed strong links to programmes in Chile, Japan, Korea, Mexico and the USA which will be further strengthened under this grant. UKCMER staff continue to contribute to standardisation activities of the IEC helping to develop the 62600 series of international standards and contributing to the work of the International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) and the International Ships and Offshore Structures Congress (ISSC).","CSE","School of Engineering","UK - Industry","engineering and physical sciences research council, wave energy scotland ltd","UNITED KINGDOM","standard, wave energy scotland limited default scheme","Robin Wallace","INSTITUTE OF ENERGY SYSTEMS","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=2830699","RA3597, RA4658(MetaTide), R45900 (AD-CON), R45901 (Buoy to WEC),R45902 (MRE Mooring), R45903 (TSTFTD)  R45807 (WES)",1873676.29,"1765138.29","108538.00",NA,"1498941.03","EP/P008682/1","YES","University of Edinburgh","Supergen Marine HUB Extension","ENG",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2016-10-01,2019-05-31,"Jennifer Loukes","John Jeffrey","Henry Jeffrey, School of Engineering","Ignazio Maria Viola, School of Engineering","David Ingram, School of Engineering","Aristides Kiprakis, School of Engineering",NA,NA,"Highlands & Islands Enterprise,Partner,Government,UNITED KINGDOM|National Renewable Energy Centre Limited,Partner,Industry,UNITED KINGDOM|National University of Mexico,Partner,HEI,MEXICO|Nagasaki Marine Industry Cluster Promotion Association,Partner,Industry,JAPAN|Marine Energy Research and Innovation Center,Partner,Industry,CHILE|Swansea University,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|Cranfield University,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Strathclyde,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Exeter,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Oxford,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Dundee,Subawardee,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"ERI - Business Development Team","Institute for Energy Systems"

the atmosphere, storing and purifying water, mitigating floods and providing a unique habitat for many plants and
animal species.
Globally, peatlands have been damaged by human activities such as afforestation releasing rather than storing
carbon. To reverse this trend, >1 million hectares of peatland forestry are now being felled across the UK.
However, several years after the tree felling started, a new ecosystem threat in the form of algal blooms has appeared
in the nearby water bodies. Caused by excess phosphates, released during or after felling, algal blooms endanger
water quality, fish populations, animal habitats and recreational activities.
In this work, I aim to determine the fate of the main algal bloom promoter, phosphorus, in restored peatlands of the
world’s biggest blanket bog, the Flow Country, Scotland using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. I will characterise
the movement and the forms of phosphorus in the peat and water bodies relative to deforested plots. This research is
imperative for the development of mitigating strategies that must become part of restoration projects involving tree
felling in peatlands. Only then can we preserve these vital ecosystems and their inhabitants.","CSE","School of Chemistry","UK - Charity","carnegie trust for the universities of scotland","UNITED KINGDOM","research incentive grants","Nicholle Bell","CHEMISTRY","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=6600075",NA,9999,"9999.00","0.00",NA,"9999.00",NA,"NO","University of Edinburgh","March 2018 round","CHE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2018-09-01,2019-08-31,"Nicola Bell",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"-",NA

2018,2019-03-07,"Successful","4129795","reconciling volcanic forcing and climate records throughout the last millennium (vol-clim)","Volcanic eruptions are an important driver of climate variability and climate change, yet climate model simulations do not agree with data on the magnitude of temperature changes caused by large-magnitude volcanic eruptions. The Vol-Clim project will resolve this discrepancy by deriving new and improved estimates of volcanic forcing using a state-of-the-art Earth System Model developed in the UK (UKESM1), which will allow us to quantify and better understand how large explosive volcanic eruptions affected the climate system since 1250 CE. The model explicitly accounts for the interaction of chemical, dynamical and aerosol microphysical processes during volcanic eruptions, all of which affect the magnitude of the climate response. However, these processes have not been taken into account in previous assessments of climate change and natural climate variability caused by volcanic eruptions since 1250 CE.

In detail, at least 60 volcanic eruptions have been detected based on volcanic deposits in polar ice-cores since 1250 CE.
Large-magnitude eruptions emit sulphur dioxide high into the stratosphere where it is oxidized to form sulphuric acid
vapour, which nucleates and condenses to form sulphate aerosol particles. These aerosol particles scatter and absorb energy from the Sun thereby cooling the Earth's surface. In terms of the magnitude of this surface cooling, tree-rings (and other data) appear to show a smaller hemispheric temperature response (of up to 1 degree Celsius) to volcanic eruptions than simulated by current climate models. This mismatch means that at present we do not fully understand how the climate system including clouds responds after volcanic eruptions. We also do not fully understand how tree growth and subsequently tree-rings respond as a consequence of the cooling induced by a volcanic eruption. Overall, these uncertainties affect our ability to use climate models to simulate past, present and future changes of climate.

Current climate models have simple implementations of volcanic effects, ignoring many key chemical and physical
processes relevant after volcanic eruptions. Using UKESM1 we will be able to simulate the evolution of volcanic aerosol
particles with unprecedented sophistication, which has the potential to greatly improve the fidelity of predicted climatic
effects and reconcile model-simulated and observational records of climate change after volcanic eruptions. Our
simulations in UKESM1 will cover the period 1250 CE to present, which will enable us to characterize and evaluate annual to centennial-scale effects on global and hemispheric surface temperatures, climate variability and impacts on surface ocean temperatures for eruptions of different frequencies and intensities. 

Vol-Clim is an ambitious project that aligns closely with international initiatives and NERC's main goals. Quantifying the contribution of volcanic eruptions to climate variability over the past millennium is key to understanding present day and future decadal-scale climate variability; this is in line with NERC's main goal 'to understand and predict how the planet works'. Vol-Clim will also help prepare society for the effects of future eruptions. Vol-Clim is also strongly aligned to international activities such as the new Past Global Changes (PAGES) working group ""Volcanic Impacts on Climate and Society (VICS)"" and the PMIP (Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project) and CMIP (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) communities. We will generate a volcanic aerosol forcing time-series (1250 CE to present) for use in those models that do not account for the chemical and physical aerosol processes in the stratosphere. These deliverables are relevant for CMIP6-endorsed activities such as VolMIP (Model Inter-comparison Project on the Climatic Response to Volcanic Forcing) and RFMIP (Radiative Forcing Model Inter-comparison Project), and also the IPCC.","CSE","School of GeoSciences","UK - Research Council","natural environment research council","UNITED KINGDOM","standard grant","Gabi Hegerl","SCHOOL OF GEOSCIENCES","https://ed-rmas.worktribe.com/record.jx?recordid=4129795","RA4633",235772,"153679.00","82093.00",NA,"188617.60","RG94689","NO","University of Cambridge",NA,"GEO",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NoFlag","No",NA,2019-03-01,2022-11-30,"David Dougal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Leeds,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of St Andrews,Collaborator,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM|University of Cambridge,Lead,HEI,UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"Award Indicative Successful",NA
